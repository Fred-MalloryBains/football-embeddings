0,0,bournemouth,2025-04-27,"Rasmus Hojlund's stoppage-time strike salvaged a point for Manchester United as they drew 1-1 with 10-man AFC Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Sunday. Antoine Semenyo’s 23rd-minute goal had put the Cherries ahead before Evanilson received a red card following a VAR review in the 70th minute, having lunged in on Noussair Mazraoui. The draw sees Bournemouth stay 10th, missing the chance to go eighth in the table, while Ruben Amorim’s visitors climb to 14th. How the match unfolded
Bournemouth deservedly went ahead after winning the ball high up the pitch midway through the first half, with Evanilson’s neat flick powered home by Semenyo at Andre Onana’s near post. United improved as the half went on and came close to an equaliser, but Kepa Arrizabalaga tipped Alejandro Garnacho’s chipped effort behind after confusion in the Cherries' defence. But the Cherries were forced to play the final 20 minutes, plus stoppage time, without Evanilson after the Brazilian was sent off for a two-footed challenge on Mazraoui. Sour taste for Cherries
Bournemouth have never finished higher than ninth in the Premier League, doing so under Eddie Howe in 2016/17, but they had an opportunity to climb back above Fulham into eighth – a position that could bring UEFA Conference League qualification. The Cherries showcased their attacking intent from the off, with Ouattara’s teasing delivery narrowly evading Evanilson on the slide inside the opening three minutes, while Justin Kluivert went close from distance. But just as the Cherries looked to kill the game off, Evanilson was given his marching orders. Bournemouth defended stoutly from then on but were undone by Hojlund, with his last-gasp leveller a potentially huge blow for Andoni Iraola's men. The visitors were caught napping from the free-kick that followed that foul, with their intent on playing out from the back punished by Bournemouth’s high press. Bournemouth continued to boss proceedings after the break, before Evanilson's red card turned the tide. Club reports

2,2,chelsea,2025-04-26,"Nicolas Jackson's first goal in 13 Premier League matches provided a major boost to Chelsea's UEFA Champions League qualification hopes as they beat Everton 1-0 at Stamford Bridge. Jackson fired home from just outside the area in the 27th minute, with this the first of his 24 Premier League goal since joining Chelsea to come from outside the box, as the Blues took advantage of Manchester City, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa being in FA Cup action this weekend. Jackson also had a potential second disallowed for offside late on, as Enzo Maresca's hosts claimed back-to-back Premier League wins. The result takes Chelsea fifth, one point behind City and above Forest on goal difference. How the match unfolded
Chelsea monopolised possession early on but needed 15 minutes to test Jordan Pickford, with the England goalkeeper tipping Noni Madueke's drive around his left post. Marc Cucurella failed to punish a wayward punch from Pickford when he volleyed wide in the 26th minute, but Chelsea did hit the front 51 seconds later. After Beto lost possession just inside his own half, Jackson turned on Enzo Fernandez's pass and picked out the bottom-left corner with a wonderful finish from 20 yards out. In the second half, Nathan Patterson's poor header forced Pickford to block at Jackson's feet, but Everton finally threatened through Beto, who drew a good stop from Sanchez. Jackson was then flagged offside when tapping home on the rebound from a Cucurella effort, and Everton almost snatched a point through McNeil, only for Sanchez to make a glorious save from his effort in the 87th minute. Heroes at both ends for Chelsea
Before Saturday, Jackson's most recent goal was the winner in a 2-1 derby victory over Brentford on 15 December, with a lack of fitness and form frustrating him since the turn of the year. But Maresca has continued to show faith in the Senegal international, insisting upon his return from a hamstring injury that Chelsea are a better team with him leading the line. Jackson had plenty to do when receiving Fernandez's pass with his back to goal, but a neat turn set him up for a pinpoint finish beyond Pickford's grasp. With Cole Palmer struggling for form, it has often felt like Chelsea have missed a focal point in attack. Jackson provided exactly that, linking the play well and leading the Blues' press admirably. And the Blues had another hero at the other end in the form of Sanchez. Everton felt he was fortunate to escape unpunished from a first-half collision with Vitalii Mykolenko, but his reflex save from McNeil was just as valuable as Jackson's goal. Arguably tasked with the most challenging run-in of all the top-five contenders, Chelsea knew the importance of a win here. Depleted Everton fall short
Everton suffered a blow this week when James Tarkowski – who had started 111 consecutive Premier League matches dating back to his time with Burnley – was ruled out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury. O'Brien acquitted himself well enough, but Patterson had a more difficult time against the lively Madueke, and if not for some proactive sweeper-keeping from Pickford, his weak header back might have gifted Jackson a second goal early in the second half. However, it was Beto, the other player brought into Everton's line-up due to Armando Broja being ineligible, that played a part in Chelsea's goal. Everton wanted a spot-kick when Sanchez collided with Mykolenko in the 39th minute, but they struggled in attack until the dying stages, when they found Chelsea's goalkeeper in inspired form.

This was the first time the Toffees had to cope without their big centre-back, and Moyes opted to introduce Patterson at right-back and shift Jake O'Brien across.

However, it was Beto, the other player brought into Everton's line-up due to Armando Broja being ineligible, that played a part in Chelsea's goal.

After Yasin Ayari had given Brighton an early lead on Saturday, Mohammed Kudus and Tomas Soucek turned the game on its head in the second half, and the Hammers led 2-1 after 88 minutes. However, Kaoru Mitoma then equalised, and Baleba sent the home fans into raptures with his stunning stoppage-time strike, leaving former Brighton boss Graham Potter scratching his head on the sidelines. Brighton move up to ninth, while West Ham stay 17th, now safe from relegation after Ipswich Town's defeat to Newcastle ensured the Tractor Boys will complete the bottom three. How the match unfolded
It took just 13 minutes for Brighton to find the opener. Simon Adingra saw a second Brighton goal disallowed in the 36th minute. Bowen was the provider again as he teed up Soucek to nod past Verbruggen in the 83rd minute, but the lead only lased for six minutes as Mitoma nodded in from close range. And Brighton ensured the spoils were theirs when Baleba bent home a sublime long-range strike in the 92nd minute. Brighton stay in the race for Europe
Brighton’s 4-2 defeat to Brentford last time out looked to have dented their chances of claiming a European spot this season, but the Seagulls have reignited those hopes. AFC Bournemouth are not in action until Sunday, but with Fulham also beating Southampton, Brighton kept pace in the hunt for Europe, avoiding what could have been a costly slip-up. And even when West Ham grabbed the initiative in the second half, Brighton always posed a threat – Wieffer seeing a header kept out before Hinshelwood’s strike was deflected over. The resilience Brighton showed after Soucek’s header will delight Fabian Hurzeler, and that never-say-die attitude will be required in the run-in. They showed signs of promise in the first half, with Soucek their standout performer – he turned Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s cross into the side netting from a tight angle before almost catching Verbruggen out with a looping header, with Brighton only saved by the bar. Soucek thought he had snatched West Ham’s first win since 27 February, but their shaky defence could not stand up against Brighton’s late pressure. Club reports

West Ham thought they had secured a first win since the end of February after themselves coming from behind to lead. After Yasin Ayari had given Brighton an early lead on Saturday, Mohammed Kudus and Tomas Soucek turned the game on its head in the second half, and the Hammers led 2-1 after 88 minutes. Brighton move up to ninth, while West Ham stay 17th, now safe from relegation after Ipswich Town's defeat to Newcastle ensured the Tractor Boys will complete the bottom three. West Ham went close to a response as Soucek headed Maximilian Kilman’s cross onto the crossbar, with Bart Verbruggen getting fingertips to it. Alphonse Areola had made a double save to deny Pervis Estupinan and Mats Wieffer before the winger rifled in, but it was adjudged that Danny Welbeck had interfered with the initial effort from an offside position. West Ham drew level three minutes into the second half, with Jarrod Bowen crossing to Kudus, who shot through Verbruggen’s legs. Bowen was the provider again as he teed up Soucek to nod past Verbruggen in the 83rd minute, but the lead only lased for six minutes as Mitoma nodded in from close range. They started well, with Ayari’s stunning finish giving Areola no chance, but they failed to take control for large parts of the game. Only the slightest of margins denied them a second goal, though – Welbeck was inches past the last man when he tried to help on Estupinan’s strike, with Areola making two smart stops before Adingra’s strike was ruled out. And even when West Ham grabbed the initiative in the second half, Brighton always posed a threat – Wieffer seeing a header kept out before Hinshelwood’s strike was deflected over. Potter makes unhappy return
West Ham knew they needed a point, or an Ipswich defeat, to confirm their Premier League status, even if they had likely been confident of it for a good while. Niclas Fullkrug’s second-half introduction helped, giving West Ham a focal point, and his movement in the six-yard box opened up the space for Kudus to meet Bowen’s cross. Soucek thought he had snatched West Ham’s first win since 27 February, but their shaky defence could not stand up against Brighton’s late pressure. Club reports

6,6,newcastle-united,2025-04-26,"Ipswich Town's relegation from the Premier League was confirmed as the 10-man Tractor Boys lost 3-0 at Newcastle United, who climbed back into the UEFA Champions League places. Ben Johnson was sent off after receiving two first-half bookings – the first for simulation – to give Ipswich a gargantuan task, and Newcastle made their numerical advantage count. Alexander Isak scored from the penalty spot in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time before Dan Burn and substitute William Osula made sure of the points, with both players scoring headers in the second half. While Ipswich will join Southampton and Leicester City in the Championship next season, Eddie Howe enjoyed a triumphant return to the St James' Park dugout after recovering from pneumonia. Newcastle had fallen out of the top five after Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Everton earlier on Saturday, but this win takes them up to third, albeit just two points above sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand as part of a competitive race for the European spots. How the match unfolded
Newcastle had the ball in the net after 23 minutes as Alex Palmer flapped at Dara O'Shea's awkward header and diverted it in, but Michael Salisbury penalised Bruno Guimaraes for a foul on the goalkeeper, with that decision confirmed by the VAR. After wasting two decent chances, Isak played a key role in Ipswich going down to 10 men in the 37th minute, as Johnson dragged him down while on a booking. But Ipswich could not make it to half-time without conceding as Julio Enciso pulled Jacob Murphy back inside the area, with Isak converting after a VAR review saw the penalty awarded. Harvey Barnes' curler was too high early in the second half, but Newcastle had daylight when Burn powered Kieran Trippier's 56th-minute cross home at the back post. And Osula's first Premier League goal came from another Trippier delivery 10 minutes from time, as he headed the full-back's corner past a helpless Palmer. Newcastle re-energised on Howe's return
The St James' Park crowd gave a rapturous reception to Howe ahead of kick-off, as he returned to the Newcastle bench after missing their last three games. Newcastle had wilted in the second half of their most recent match, a 4-1 loss to fellow Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa, prompting Howe’s assistant Jason Tindall to blame their fatigue levels. Rather than overplay with the extra man, Newcastle upped the tempo considerably and made Ipswich defend a barrage of crosses. That relentless pressure told when a quickly taken corner led to the penalty incident, and rather than sit on their lead, Newcastle continued to force Ipswich back and got a second through EFL Cup final hero Burn. Newcastle's power and athleticism was simply too much for the visitors, and Osula rose brilliantly inside a crowded penalty area for their third goal. With a tough run of fixtures against Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea and Arsenal on the horizon before a final-day match with Everton, Newcastle knew there was no margin for error here. Goal difference could yet be a factor in the battle for a top-five finish, and Newcastle could even had added a fourth at the death, as Anthony Gordon came off the bench to curl just wide. They started brightly as Jack Clarke's deflected effort trickled wide, and Newcastle did not have a shot on target until the 43rd minute. With Ipswich enjoying a decent spell, Johnson threw himself over Burn's outstretched leg and received his first booking, and less than seven minutes later, he was trudging to the changing rooms after making the senseless choice to drag Isak down.

Mistakes cost relegated Ipswich
Ipswich entered this game knowing only an improbable victory on Tyneside – coupled with Brighton beating West Ham – would stave off relegation, at least for another week. With Brighton keeping up their end of the bargain, ultimately beating the Hammers 3-2, Ipswich briefly had hope of prolonging the fight. But competing in the Premier League means keeping mistakes to a minimum, and some poor decision-making from Johnson and Enciso cost Kieran McKenna's men. With Ipswich enjoying a decent spell, Johnson threw himself over Burn's outstretched leg and received his first booking, and less than seven minutes later, he was trudging to the changing rooms after making the senseless choice to drag Isak down. Ipswich were never likely to fight back from that position, and their defeat means all three relegation places have been confirmed with as many as four games remaining for the first time in Premier League history. With matches against Everton, Brentford, Leicester and West Ham remaining, Ipswich will now hope to build some positivity ahead of a potential promotion push in 2025/26. Club reports

8,8,southampton,2025-04-26,"Ryan Sessegnon’s stoppage-time winner kept Fulham on course for European qualification as Marco Silva’s team came from behind to beat Southampton 2-1 at St Mary’s Stadium. Southampton in 20th, looked primed to surpass the record-low Premier League points tally of 11 they share with the Derby County team of 2007/08 thanks to an early goal from Jack Stephens. But against the run of play, Southampton struck two minutes later when Stephens flicked in Ryan Manning’s set-piece, leaving Bernd Leno rooted to the spot. Southampton appealed for a penalty soon after when Ross Stewart, played through smartly by Kyle Walker-Peters, went down under Calvin Bassey's challenge, but referee Tony Harrington waved play on, before Stephens showed his worth defensively with a vital intervention to clear Andreas Pereira’s cross. But Southampton responded almost immediately, with Walker-Peters charging into the box and forcing Leno into a sharp diving save with a powerful strike across goal. Yet when Smith Rowe’s effort deflected in off Jan Bednarek, Fulham finally had momentum. Saints show some fight but fail to hold on
With their fate already sealed, Southampton’s task now is to get at least one more point to avoid equalling that unwanted record set by Derby 17 years ago. Interim boss Simon Rusk would have been keen to build on his side’s spirited 1-1 draw with West Ham United last time out to end the season strongly and deliver Southampton their first win since February, and they got off to just the right kind of start, halting Fulham’s rhythm with some controlled possession before Stephens nodded in the opener in the 14th minute. Southampton carried on with the crowd right behind them, leading to a resolute defensive display to protect their lead heading into half-time. Adama Traore set up Willian to hit a post, while Jimenez kept Southampton on their toes. Club reports

9,9,fulham,2025-04-26,"Ryan Sessegnon’s stoppage-time winner kept Fulham on course for European qualification as Marco Silva’s team came from behind to beat Southampton 2-1 at St Mary’s Stadium. The win leaves Fulham in eighth on 51 points, the same as ninth-placed Brighton & Hove Albion and two ahead of AFC Bournemouth, who face Manchester United on Sunday. How the match unfolded
Sessegnon and Willian combined sharply early on for Fulham, with Willian – still chasing his first goal since rejoining the club – curling a lovely effort just wide of a post in the 12th minute. But against the run of play, Southampton struck two minutes later when Stephens flicked in Ryan Manning’s set-piece, leaving Bernd Leno rooted to the spot. Southampton appealed for a penalty soon after when Ross Stewart, played through smartly by Kyle Walker-Peters, went down under Calvin Bassey's challenge, but referee Tony Harrington waved play on, before Stephens showed his worth defensively with a vital intervention to clear Andreas Pereira’s cross. Willian struck a post as Fulham came out of the traps in the second half, though the woodwork came to the visitors’ rescue from a Cameron Archer attempt at the other end. But Southampton responded almost immediately, with Walker-Peters charging into the box and forcing Leno into a sharp diving save with a powerful strike across goal. Yet when Smith Rowe’s effort deflected in off Jan Bednarek, Fulham finally had momentum. Interim boss Simon Rusk would have been keen to build on his side’s spirited 1-1 draw with West Ham United last time out to end the season strongly and deliver Southampton their first win since February, and they got off to just the right kind of start, halting Fulham’s rhythm with some controlled possession before Stephens nodded in the opener in the 14th minute. Archer struck the frame of the goal with a driven cross-shot as Rusk’s side continued to keep Fulham at bay, but the Cottagers’ improved second-half display eventually took its toll, with the hosts running out of steam at a crucial time. Silva’s substitutes spark incredible comeback
After squandering a golden chance to boost their European hopes when they capitulated late on against Chelsea, Fulham knew a win was required to keep them in the race. But Stephens' opener dealt the Cottagers a heavy blow, and they struggled to gain a real foothold in the game after that, mustering only a handful of half-chances through Alex Iwobi and Jimenez. A significantly improved second-half performance saw Fulham regain some control and Silva’s substitutions played a huge part. The final say belonged to Sessegnon, and if Fulham are to push on in their quest for Europe, they will have to build on this momentum when they face Aston Villa next. Club reports

10,10,wolverhampton,2025-04-26,"An inspired display from Matheus Cunha led Wolverhampton Wanderers to a sixth straight Premier League victory following their 3-0 win over relegated Leicester City. The Brazilian scored and provided two assists as the resurgent hosts extended their record streak of successes in the competition at Molineux, where Jamie Vardy's second-half penalty was denied. Cunha broke the deadlock with a close-range finish for his 15th league goal of the season for Wolves, who secured their top-flight status after last weekend's 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. The Brazilian then turned provider after the break for Jorgen Strand Larsen and Rodrigo Gomes to condemn the Foxes to a 10th defeat in 11 games. How the match unfolded
Wolves carried the greater attacking threat from the off. Cunha was marginally off target from distance, while he also shot straight at Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Although, the Algerian played a key role as Wolves broke the deadlock in the 33rd minute, with his fizzing low ball across the six-yard box turned in by Cunha. Strand Larsen should have doubled the hosts’ lead when he fired over from two yards out, but the Wolves striker was not to be denied in the 56th minute; receiving a well-timed pass from Cunha and slotting past Hermansen. Leicester were given a lifeline in the 70th minute when Jose Sa felled Vardy in the box, but the Wolves goalkeeper atoned for his error by guessing correctly to deny Leicester's captain. The hosts had the final word five minutes from time, with substitute Gomes’ neat finish from a Cunha pass rounding off a swift counter and sealing the victory. Six in a row for Wolves
To say Wolves are currently riding the crest of a wave would be an understatement. After sounding out several warnings, Wolves finally broke the deadlock with Cunha in the right place at the right time to direct Ait-Nouri's cross home. Strand Larsen, who was off target from close range on two separate occasions, was third time lucky with a neat finish from Cunha's through-ball that was ultimately enough to put the game beyond Leicester. Wolves face reigning Premier League champions Manchester City next Friday and will travel to the Etihad Stadium full of confidence as they aim to maintain their strong finish to the campaign. However, Ruud van Nistelrooy will have known it would be difficult to do that against a Wolves side brimming with confidence. The Foxes failed to heed their early warnings and were eventually punished as Cunha struck from close range. Bilal El Khannouss went close from distance in the 55th minute but, within 60 seconds, the visitors were 2-0 down as Wolves cut through the defence courtesy of Cunha and Strand Larsen. Club reports

Leicester outfoxed
With their Premier League fate already sealed, Leicester are now playing for pride in an attempt to build some momentum before returning to the Championship next season. The Foxes failed to heed their early warnings and were eventually punished as Cunha struck from close range. Leicester lost Bobby De Cordova-Reid to injury before the break, while Van Nistelrooy then made three changes at half-time. Vardy, who announced in the week he will leave Leicester at the end of the season, had the opportunity to begin his farewell tour with a goal, but his tame penalty was kept out by Sa in his bottom-right corner. Rodrigo then put the contest well and truly beyond the Foxes later on, as they failed to score in a 16th Premier League game this season. Club reports

12,12,arsenal,2025-04-23,"William Saliba's costly error saw Arsenal slip to a 2-2 draw at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday, leaving Liverpool a point away from Premier League glory. Only a Palace victory at the Emirates Stadium would have secured Liverpool their 20th top-flight crown without kicking a ball, but the Reds can wrap up the title if they do not lose to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. The second equaliser arrived late and came in bizarre fashion as Saliba gifted the ball to Palace substitute Jean-Philippe Mateta, who executed a sublime lob that clipped the crossbar on its way in. The draw means Arsenal are 12 points off the pace with only four matches to play, while Palace are still 12th but a point closer to the European places. Trossard twisted in the box and saw a deflected effort restore Arsenal's scarcely deserved lead three minutes before the break. Arsenal had the ball in the net again against the run of play 70 minutes in, only for a VAR review to confirm it had gone out of play before Jurrien Timber crossed for Gabriel Martinelli after the assistant referee had initially flagged for offside. Dean Henderson then instinctively kept out Bukayo Saka, before Saliba's mistake was punished ruthlessly by Mateta, who saw Raya off his line, in the 87th minute, yet eight minutes of stoppage time did not bring the decisive goal. Consistency continues to escape Arsenal
Even if the title race is all but run, Arsenal would have been looking for three points on Wednesday to maintain their momentum ahead of their next match, a huge Champions League semi-final first leg against Paris Saint-Germain next week. In beating Real Madrid home and away, Arsenal have proven they can lift themselves for the biggest games, with those performances alone enough to keep PSG on their toes. However, Arsenal have not strung together more than three wins in a row in the Premier League this season, suffering repeated setbacks in their bid to apply pressure to Liverpool. Arsenal have been held 13 times this season, including in three of their past four matches, albeit injury absences for Martin Odegaard and Saka have not helped in their bid to come up with much-needed winners. Saka started from the bench on Wednesday, and his team-mates created precious little from open play before his introduction. Arsenal did have a chance to snatch it late on, with Martinelli setting off on a driving run from a long throw-in, but the Brazil international could only find the side netting as three points went begging. But this was a return to form for Oliver Glasner's side, with the Austrian joining Mikel Arteta in making changes ahead of a big semi-final, and they might have seen off Arsenal had their first XI been on the pitch at the same time. Ex-Arsenal man Eddie Nketiah was wasteful with a couple of sights of goal in the first half, with Mateta making a big impact later on. With Wharton, Eze and Mateta all on song and fresh enough after limited minutes in this match, Villa will have to be more wary than Saliba and co. Club reports

Only a Palace victory at the Emirates Stadium would have secured Liverpool their 20th top-flight crown without kicking a ball, but the Reds can wrap up the title if they do not lose to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Palace never led but were the better side for long stretches, responding to Jakub Kiwior's early opener with a fine Eberechi Eze goal before working hard to cancel out Leandro Trossard's strike shortly before half-time. The second equaliser arrived late and came in bizarre fashion as Saliba gifted the ball to Palace substitute Jean-Philippe Mateta, who executed a sublime lob that clipped the crossbar on its way in. The draw means Arsenal are 12 points off the pace with only four matches to play, while Palace are still 12th but a point closer to the European places. How the match unfolded
An enthralling encounter began with the league's two most effective set-piece sides trading blows, with Kiwior's towering header from beyond the penalty spot after three minutesfollowed by Eze's volley from a right-wing corner on 27 minutes. A succession of Palace headers then had David Raya sweating in the second half as Justin Devenny notably miscued, while Daniel Munoz nodded across the face of goal. Dean Henderson then instinctively kept out Bukayo Saka, before Saliba's mistake was punished ruthlessly by Mateta, who saw Raya off his line, in the 87th minute, yet eight minutes of stoppage time did not bring the decisive goal. Perfect pre-Wembley pick-me-up for Palace
Palace head into their FA Cup semi-final clash with Aston Villa at Wembley with just one win in their six matches since the quarter-finals, having won four in a row in all competitions prior to that. But this was a return to form for Oliver Glasner's side, with the Austrian joining Mikel Arteta in making changes ahead of a big semi-final, and they might have seen off Arsenal had their first XI been on the pitch at the same time. Ex-Arsenal man Eddie Nketiah was wasteful with a couple of sights of goal in the first half, with Mateta making a big impact later on. By that point, fellow star men Adam Wharton and Eze had made way, but Palace kept pushing. If this was a missed opportunity, it is one Palace will be able to move on from quickly if they can upset high-flying Villa on Saturday. With Wharton, Eze and Mateta all on song and fresh enough after limited minutes in this match, Villa will have to be more wary than Saliba and co. Club reports

14,14,manchester-city,2025-04-22,"Matheus Nunes scored a 94th-minute winner as Manchester City beat Aston Villa 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium, providing a major boost to their hopes of UEFA Champions League qualification. Nunes side-footed home at the back post, his first goal in the Premier League for City, after being found by Jeremy Doku deep into stoppage time, as Pep Guardiola's hosts made their sustained pressure count. Bernardo Silva had earlier put City ahead when he forced an Emiliano Martinez error in the seventh minute, though Marcus Rashford levelled from the penalty spot after Ruben Dias fouled Jacob Ramsey. City upped the pressure in the second half with Omar Marmoush finding the net, only to be flagged offside, but Villa's defence could not hold on through five minutes of time added on. The result takes City up to third in the Premier League table, one point clear of fourth-placed Nottingham Forest and two ahead of Newcastle United in fifth. But that sparked City into action and the hosts swiftly took the lead. City, though, were quickly brought back down to earth as Villa were awarded a penalty in the 18th minute. James McAtee nearly put City ahead with a stunning lob from 25 yards out on the hour mark, then Marmoush saw a goal ruled out for offside as City continued to press. Villa could not hold firm until full-time, though, with Nunes tapping in Doku’s outside of the boot cross to spark wild celebrations among the home fans. City’s Etihad edge intact
City were far from convincing in their 2-0 win over Everton at the weekend, relying on late goals from Nico O’Reilly and Mateo Kovacic to secure the points at Goodison Park. Heading into Tuesday’s match, City had a dominant record at home to Villa, winning the last 14 Premier League meetings at the Etihad, with their most recent such loss coming in 2007. The Etihad hasn't quite been the fortress it once was for Guardiola’s side, though. City have now conceded 22 goals at home in the league this season – their highest tally since 2003/04. The visitors were reduced to digging in for a point late on, and Nunes timed his first Premier League goal for City – and his first overall since April 2023 – to perfection. Having taken a huge step towards securing Champions League football, City will now turn their attention to their FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest this weekend, with in-form Wolverhampton Wanderers their next league opponents. Rashford resurgence continues but Villa stumble
After bouncing back from their heartbreaking Champions League elimination with a statement 4-1 win over Newcastle, Villa arrived at the Etihad full of confidence. Unai Emery’s side had won the reverse fixture last December, and, with two wins in their last three matches against City, the Spaniard would’ve felt his team had a chance. Rashford's successful penalty means he has now scored five Premier League goals against Guardiola’s City, with only Mohamed Salah (nine) and Jamie Vardy (eight) having more. Later, he burst past Gvardiol to meet a lovely Youri Tielemans pass but could only fire into the side netting after rounding the City goalkeeper. Club reports

Rashford nearly gave Villa a dream start, striking the woodwork with a low shot just 18 seconds in after skipping past Dias.

City, though, were quickly brought back down to earth as Villa were awarded a penalty in the 18th minute.

Heading into Tuesday’s match, City had a dominant record at home to Villa, winning the last 14 Premier League meetings at the Etihad, with their most recent such loss coming in 2007. Their defensive frailties were obvious again in the first half as Villa’s dynamic forwards – namely Rashford and Morgan Rogers – constantly threatened to get in behind. Dias and Josko Gvardiol had plenty of nervy moments but were ultimately spared as Villa ran out of steam in the second half. Rashford resurgence continues but Villa stumble

Later, he burst past Gvardiol to meet a lovely Youri Tielemans pass but could only fire into the side netting after rounding the City goalkeeper. Villa will rue missing those chances, as Nunes’ late strike dealt a serious blow to their European hopes.

18,18,tottenham-hotspur,2025-04-21,"Nottingham Forest returned to third place in the Premier League following a hard-earned 2-1 victory at Tottenham Hotspur. First-half goals from Elliot Anderson and Chris Wood were enough to get Nuno Espirito Santo’s side back to winning ways, following two consecutive defeats, despite the hosts dominating for large periods at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Anderson’s deflected strike opened the scoring, while Wood’s 19th league goal of the season doubled Forest’s lead in the 16th minute. Spurs made their second-half dominance count, with Richarlison halving the deficit three minutes from time, but it proved too late as they suffered a fourth defeat in five league games. Forest leapfrog Newcastle United, Manchester City and Chelsea to boost their own UEFA Champions League qualification hopes, while Ange Postecoglou’s side remain 16th. How the match unfolded
The visitors scored first after just five minutes when Spurs failed to deal with a corner, and Anderson drilled through a crowded penalty area and beyond Guglielmo Vicario, via a slight Rodrigo Bentancur deflection. Anderson thought he had turned provider for Wood in the 10th minute, but his close-range finished was ruled out for offside following a VAR review. Spurs responded well and should have reduced their arrears when Mathys Tel sliced a shot wide, while Richarlison also failed to hit the target with a close-range header from Wilson Odobert's delivery. Dejan Kulusevski saw a header acrobatically cleared off the line by Harry Toffolo, while Matz Sels brilliantly thwarted Richarlison's header. Richarlison did offer Spurs hope when he nodded in Pedro Porro's deep cross, but it was not enough to avert an 18th league defeat of the season. Dominant Spurs come up short
Fresh from securing their UEFA Europa League semi-final place with a battling victory over Eintracht Frankfurt, Spurs looked to get their Premier League form back on track. First, the hosts failed to deal with the corner that led to Anderson’s goal, while they switched off for the free-kick that allowed Elanga space to cross for Wood’s header. The omens did not look good thereon for Spurs, who have now failed to win any of their last 12 Premier League matches when conceding first. It was mainly strong goalkeeping and defending that largely kept them at bay, until Richarlison’s moment of quality came just a little too late. Spurs must quickly dust themselves down. Postecoglou’s team turn their attention towards spoiling Liverpool’s potential title-winning party at Anfield on Sunday, before their crucial Europa League semi-final first leg against Bodo/Glimt grasps their full focus. The visitors made a purposeful start on Nuno’s latest return to the club where he spent just four months in charge during the 2021/22 season. Forest had scored first in a league-high 24 games this season, and Gibbs-White sounded a warning with a fierce attempt from distance after four minutes. They were ahead within a minute thanks to Anderson’s strike, with Wood’s authoritative header giving them breathing space. It largely worked until Richarlison’s well-placed header late on, but the visitors continued to dig deep for what could be a crucial three points towards their European ambitions. Interestingly, Chelsea on the final day provide their only top-half opposition for the remainder of the season. Club reports

19,19,nottingham-forest,2025-04-21,"Nottingham Forest returned to third place in the Premier League following a hard-earned 2-1 victory at Tottenham Hotspur. First-half goals from Elliot Anderson and Chris Wood were enough to get Nuno Espirito Santo’s side back to winning ways, following two consecutive defeats, despite the hosts dominating for large periods at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Anderson’s deflected strike opened the scoring, while Wood’s 19th league goal of the season doubled Forest’s lead in the 16th minute. Forest leapfrog Newcastle United, Manchester City and Chelsea to boost their own UEFA Champions League qualification hopes, while Ange Postecoglou’s side remain 16th. However, Wood was not to be denied seven minutes later, as he beat Vicario in the air to nod home Anthony Elanga's cross. Despite Morgan Gibbs-White drilling a shot narrowly wide, the hosts continued to demonstrate the stronger attacking threat in the second half. First, the hosts failed to deal with the corner that led to Anderson’s goal, while they switched off for the free-kick that allowed Elanga space to cross for Wood’s header. Forest back to winning ways
Having endured a minor reality check in recent weeks, Forest were aiming to avoid suffering three successive Premier League defeats for the first time in over a year while, more importantly, vying to get their Champions League quest back on track. The visitors made a purposeful start on Nuno’s latest return to the club where he spent just four months in charge during the 2021/22 season. Forest had scored first in a league-high 24 games this season, and Gibbs-White sounded a warning with a fierce attempt from distance after four minutes. Their credentials at the other end of the pitch were then frequently tested over the remainder of the contest, and Nuno sacrificed Elanga for defender Morato at half-time in a bid to weather the storm.

20,20,leicester-city,2025-04-20,"Trent Alexander-Arnold came off the bench to secure Liverpool a 1-0 victory at the King Power Stadium that took his team one win from the Premier League title and condemned Leicester City to relegation. Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the woodwork in a chaotic build-up to the winner before Alexander-Arnold’s powerful volley finally beat Mads Hermansen in the 76th minute. Leicester thought they had ended their scoreless run at home shortly before, but Conor Coady’s close-range header was disallowed for a foul on Alisson Becker by Patson Daka. Leicester are 19th with 18 points. How the match unfolded
The Foxes were given a let-off inside the opening three minutes as Salah beat the offside trap, only to see his strike hit the far post, before rolling along the goalline to bounce back out off the opposite post. Stephy Mavididi then brilliantly held off Conor Bradley with a driving run down the left to pick out Wilfred Ndidi, whose first-time effort smacked the foot of Alisson’s far post. Then Salah forced Hermansen into a sprawling save at the other end straight after. Ndidi made a timely block in front of the line to keep out Ibrahima Konate’s header, and Hermansen tipped Cody Gakpo’s curler over the bar before the break. Liverpool upped the pressure in the second half, but it was Leicester who thought they had opened the scoring. Down and out
Leicester have endured a torrid season, and their relegation back to the Championship was finally confirmed on Sunday. The Foxes did not back down from the challenge, though, with Ndidi coming within inches of ending their barren run with Alisson wrongfooted, only to strike the woodwork. They were well-drilled in defence, with Hermansen the standout performer for much of the game. Despite sitting through a ninth consecutive home game without a goal, the Leicester faithful stayed in good numbers, though they are still heading back to the second tier with five games to spare, with Wolverhampton Wanderers next up. Liverpool move within touching distance of title
Arsenal’s win over Ipswich Town earlier on Sunday ensured that Liverpool could not clinch the title at the King Power, but it is now only a matter of time before they get their hands on the Premier League Trophy for a second time. It looked like Leicester’s goal was living a charmed life when the ball bounced off the woodwork twice in quick succession, but nobody was picking up the England international, who put his laces through the shot to score.

He did get his hands on Alexander-Arnold’s strike, but the power beat him. Liverpool move within touching distance of title
Arsenal’s win over Ipswich Town earlier on Sunday ensured that Liverpool could not clinch the title at the King Power, but it is now only a matter of time before they get their hands on the Premier League Trophy for a second time. Having returned to winning ways with a late victory over West Ham last weekend, Liverpool looked set to pick up where they left off with Salah leading the charge with the unluckiest of strikes as he hit both posts. Salah had scored in all five previous Premier League games this season against the promoted sides, and he was keen to become the only player to score in all six such matches, but he could not find his golden touch, missing several big openings. In the end, it was one of Arne Slot’s substitutes that had the final say as Alexander-Arnold took just five minutes to get on the scoresheet after returning from an ankle injury. Liverpool could win the title without kicking a ball if Palace do them a favour on Wednesday, but if not, a victory over Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday will get them over the line. Club reports

Ipswich’s day went from bad to worse shortly after when Leif Davis was sent off for a late challenge on Bukayo Saka, leaving the hosts with a mountain to climb. Meanwhile, Ipswich remain 18th, 15 points adrift of safety with only 15 points left to play for. Matters quickly worsened for Ipswich as Davis was shown a straight red card just past the half-hour mark when he caught Saka's right leg from behind with his studs. Though Ipswich teased some promise through George Hirst’s narrow miss, Arsenal picked up where they left off after the break.

Ipswich’s Portman Road pain persists as relegation closes in
Kieran McKenna’s side would have taken plenty of confidence from their 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last weekend, but it was a significantly less enjoyable outing on Sunday. From the first whistle, the Tractor Boys looked off the pace. Julio Enciso showed a flash of promise early on, bursting past Declan Rice, but Ipswich laboured through a difficult first half with little else to cheer. Aside from small hints of their attacking potential, Ipswich never looked like truly threatening David Raya’s goal as they fell to a seventh straight Premier League home loss in 2025, matching their combined total from the previous two years. With tougher tests lying ahead, McKenna will be hoping for a better showing for their trip to Newcastle United next Saturday.

The Belgian fired the Gunners ahead early on, slipping the ball past Alex Palmer, before Gabriel Martinelli extended their lead just before the half-hour mark. Ipswich’s day went from bad to worse shortly after when Leif Davis was sent off for a late challenge on Bukayo Saka, leaving the hosts with a mountain to climb. Trossard completed his double in a one-sided affair with a fine finish in the 69th minute, while Ethan Nwaneri’s heavily deflected strike beat a helpless Palmer for Arsenal's fourth with two minutes remaining. By cutting the gap at the top to 10 points ahead of Liverpool's match at Leicester City, Arsenal will make the leaders wait until Wednesday at the earliest to become champions. How the match unfolded
The Gunners dominated the opening exchanges, and after seeing an early effort blocked, Trossard made swift amends, sliding a low finish into the bottom corner while off-balance, 14 minutes in. Mikel Merino nearly added a second goal soon after, glancing a header from a corner just over, but the Spaniard turned provider in the 28th minute with a sumptuous backheel flick to set up Martinelli to double Arsenal’s advantage. Matters quickly worsened for Ipswich as Davis was shown a straight red card just past the half-hour mark when he caught Saka's right leg from behind with his studs. Though Ipswich teased some promise through George Hirst’s narrow miss, Arsenal picked up where they left off after the break.

Julio Enciso showed a flash of promise early on, bursting past Declan Rice, but Ipswich laboured through a difficult first half with little else to cheer. High-flying Gunners put on a show
Fresh from silencing the Santiago Bernabeu in some style, en route to their first Champions League semi-final since 2009, Arsenal came into Sunday’s affair brimming with confidence. And it showed right from the outset as Mikel Arteta’s side dominated the proceedings at Portman Road. Trossard’s early blocked shot was a warning sign as he soon opened the scoring, while Merino nearly doubled the lead when he glanced a header just wide from a pinpoint Saka corner. With their one-man advantage, the Gunners put on a clinic and began to turn the screws on Ipswich. Saka, central to much of their attacking play, saw a flurry of good chances go begging across the first half. Saka came close once again before the break, steering a low shot just inches wide from Trossard’s centre, but exited the second half to sit on the bench with an ice pack on his right ankle, which Arteta will be hoping is not seriously hurt. The Gunners took their foot off the accelerator in the second half, with Trossard and Nwaneri having sealed the win.

Danny Welbeck cancelled out Jean-Philippe Mateta's brilliant opener, but Munoz regained the hosts' advantage within 10 minutes of the restart. Palace had to navigate a nervy 12 additional minutes after Eddie Nketiah and Marc Guehi were dismissed, but did so to record their sixth win in seven matches in all competitions. Oliver Glasner’s side moved up a place to 11th and four points off eighth-place Brighton, who also had Jan Paul van Hecke sent off in stoppage time and suffered only their second defeat in nine away games. How the match unfolded
Just three minutes had elapsed when Eberechi Eze found Mateta, who took the ball in his stride before beating Bart Verbruggen with an emphatic left-footed finish into the top corner. Palace almost doubled their lead soon after when Eze's low drive was turned away by Verbruggen. Eze led their charge on the counter before finding Munoz, who drilled a low shot across Verbruggen and into the far corner. Palace were reduced to nine men late on when Nketiah and Guehi both received second yellow cards for high challenges on Van Hecke and Brajan Gruda respectively. Eagles back to winning ways
Though held by bottom side Southampton in midweek, Palace still arrived for this match on a six-game unbeaten streak in all competitions. Mateta sounded a warning when he drilled wide from a tight angle in the second minute. The striker found the net for a third successive Premier League home game, with what was Palace's quickest goal in the top flight this season at two minutes and 19 seconds. Although they were pegged back by Welbeck’s goal, Palace began the second half in a similarly positive manner. It was an important victory, too, with trips to Manchester City and Newcastle United next up for Glasner’s side, who also face Bournemouth, Arsenal, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest in their next six games. The early signs did not look good as Palace struck first, especially given their opponents had only lost once when scoring first in the Premier League this season. Club reports

26,26,manchester-united,2025-04-20,"Pablo Sarabia's stunning free-kick secured Wolverhampton Wanderers' Premier League safety with a 1-0 victory over Manchester United. The contest appeared to be drifting towards a stalemate at Old Trafford, with both sides demonstrating a general lack of quality in the final third. Meanwhile, United were unable to build on the momentum of their midweek Europa League heroics, as their winless league streak extended to four matches. How the match unfolded
Both sides generally struggled to generate a decent attacking threat during the first half, though United went the closest to breaking the deadlock. Christian Eriksen's free-kick was tipped over by Dan Bentley, who was a late replacement in the Wolves goal after Jose Sa was injured during the warm-up, while Kobbie Mainoo curled wide from just outside the box. Toti's wonderful last-ditch tackle denied Rasmus Hojlund, who was then inches away from connecting with Alejandro Garnacho's cross at the far post. As the breakthrough continued to elude United, Wolves struck against the run of play in the 78th minute. Sarabia – shortly after replacing Jorgen Strand Larsen – curled a free-kick from just outside the box beyond the helpless dive of Andre Onana. The visitors had to stand firm for the remainder as United pushed for the equaliser, but did so to extend their superb run of form and, more importantly, ensure Premier League football will now officially return to Molineux next term. United brought back down to earth
Following a difficult season, the Old Trafford faithful were given something to cheer about on Thursday evening, when their side scored three times in the space of six extra-time minutes to stun Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals. There were jubilant scenes as United kept their hopes of securing Champions League football next season alive. He introduced Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount just before the hour mark in a bid to boost United’s attacking threat, but the goal just would not come for them. Successive away matches against Bournemouth and Brentford are next up for United in the league. Wonderful Wolves secure safety

28,28,west-ham-united,2025-03-10,"Bruno Guimaraes was the hero as Newcastle United boosted their UEFA Champions League qualifying hopes with a 1-0 win over West Ham United. The Magpies skipper scored the only goal to settle a closely fought contest at the London Stadium ahead of their EFL Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday. Guimaraes latched onto Harvey Barnes’ 63rd-minute cross to volley past Alphonse Areola, who produced a magnificent save to thwart a spectacular Max Kilman own-goal moments earlier. How the match unfolded
West Ham went straight on the attack with just 43 seconds on the clock when a cross to the far post reached Tomas Soucek, who fired over from inside the six-yard box. Newcastle went close at the other end as Barnes diverted Kieran Trippier’s drilled effort towards goal, only to be denied by Areola, with the West Ham goalkeeper also saving the winger’s header soon after. Areola came to the rescue again in the 61st minute, somehow managing to brilliantly claw the ball off the line after Kilman deflected Jacob Murphy's cross dangerously towards the hosts' net. However, Areola was powerless as Newcastle broke the deadlock two minutes later, with Guimaraes arriving late to volley home Barnes' centre from inside the six-yard box. West Ham attempted to push for the equaliser late on, but they never truly threatened the stubborn Newcastle defence, who held out for a first clean sheet in six matches across all competitions. Hammers humbled on home soil
West Ham will have been confident heading into this match. After recording back-to-back victories, the Hammers were looking to record three straight Premier League wins for the first time since December 2023 under David Moyes. However, as Newcastle grew into the contest, Areola had to be on top form to prevent the Magpies from striking first. Yet, West Ham did not learn their lesson, and further slack defending was eventually punished, with Guimaraes allowed to ghost into the box and steer home. The Hammers head to Goodison Park this weekend to face former boss Moyes and his resurgent Everton side. The winger brought the best out of Areola at his near post, before providing the telling cross for Guimaraes to volley in the winning goal. After extending their unbeaten Premier League streak at the London Stadium to six matches, they will hope for similar fortunes in the English capital next weekend, and that they finally end their 70-year wait for major silverware.

29,29,newcastle-united,2025-03-10,"Bruno Guimaraes was the hero as Newcastle United boosted their UEFA Champions League qualifying hopes with a 1-0 win over West Ham United. The Magpies skipper scored the only goal to settle a closely fought contest at the London Stadium ahead of their EFL Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday. Eddie Howe’s side were comfortably in control thereafter, as they secured only a second win in five Premier League matches. Newcastle move up to sixth place – and within two points of fourth-place Chelsea – while Graham Potter’s side stay 16th. Newcastle went close at the other end as Barnes diverted Kieran Trippier’s drilled effort towards goal, only to be denied by Areola, with the West Ham goalkeeper also saving the winger’s header soon after. However, Areola was powerless as Newcastle broke the deadlock two minutes later, with Guimaraes arriving late to volley home Barnes' centre from inside the six-yard box. West Ham attempted to push for the equaliser late on, but they never truly threatened the stubborn Newcastle defence, who held out for a first clean sheet in six matches across all competitions. However, as Newcastle grew into the contest, Areola had to be on top form to prevent the Magpies from striking first. The hosts struggled to mount a genuine push for an equaliser in the closing stages, and Newcastle were comfortable winners in the end. Magpies warm up for Wembley
Newcastle were seeking a response after their disappointing FA Cup exit at the hands of Brighton & Hove Albion last weekend. The Magpies will be without the suspended Anthony Gordon at Wembley, but Barnes certainly made the most of his opportunity to fill the void. After three defeats in four matches in all competitions, that was the ideal reply by Newcastle ahead of their trip to Wembley. Howe’s side are also right back in the race for the top four, though the two-point deficit may be increased after this weekend due to their absence from league action. Club reports

It was all Brentford after the interval, with Mbeumo scoring another quick goal, then teeing up Wissa, before Joao Pedro was sent off. Mbeumo and Wissa are now both among the top six goalscorers this season, with 18 and 16 Premier League goals respectively.

Thomas Frank’s side remain 11th but are now just two points behind 10th-placed Brighton, who missed the chance to move up to eighth. How the match unfolded
Brentford made a fast start, with Bart Verbruggen denying Wissa early on before Mbeumo gave them the lead. But Brentford came to the fore after the break. Mbeumo enjoyed a fair slice of luck as his left-footed effort took a deflection off Lewis Dunk and nestled into the far corner three minutes into the second half. Wissa finished off Mbeumo’s low cross from near the penalty spot shortly before the hour, and in the 61st minute, Brighton were reduced to 10 men. Brentford defended strongly from there and secured the win that keeps them in touch with the European places as Norgaard nodded in a stoppage-time free-kick. Bees find their buzz
This was a big afternoon for Brentford, who finally ended their run of eight Premier League home matches without a win to stay alive in the race for Europe. Frank’s side had started so strongly at home this season, but that form had trailed off in recent months, with that run including failure to beat bottom-half Tottenham Hotspur and Everton since the beginning of February. But with two of the division’s leading marksmen in Wissa and Mbeumo up front, they always have the firepower to win games – a fact proven on Saturday. Mbeumo took his first goal nicely with his wrong foot, before he enjoyed some luck as a left-footed shot found the corner via a big deflection off Dunk to restore Brentford’s lead early in the second half. He then turned provider for his partner, teeing up Wissa to slam in a third just before the hour mark, seemingly putting Brentford in control, and despite a slightly nervy ending, they held out for a vital three points. The goals took Mbeumo to 18 and Wissa to 16 Premier League strikes this season, with only Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak, Erling Haaland and Chris Wood keeping pace. And they could still be playing European football next season too, with the Bees only three points behind eighth-placed AFC Bournemouth. Club reports

Streaky Seagulls stall again
Brighton have been hugely impressive for long periods of this season, but their streaky nature may be what lets them down in the race for Europe. Between late-November and mid-January, the Seagulls went eight matches without a win, including failures to beat the bottom two, Southampton and Leicester City. Part of that could be put down to the youth in their side, with five of their front six in west London aged 25 or younger, and one of them, Joao Pedro, needlessly sent off after losing his temper in the second half.

32,32,chelsea,2025-03-09,"Marc Cucurella's second-half goal was enough for Chelsea to beat Leicester City 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and leapfrog Manchester City into fourth spot. Cole Palmer had seen a first-half penalty brilliantly saved by Mads Hermansen to extend his goal drought to nine matches in all competitions, with the Blues becoming increasingly frustrated before Cucurella struck. In leading his side to victory over his former club for the second time this season, Enzo Maresca takes Chelsea back up to fourth, while Leicester remain six points below the dotted line in 19th. How the match unfolded
The first half was a story of two near misses at each end, despite Chelsea's domination in the main. Jadon Sancho won a penalty in the 19th minute after Victor Kristiansen's foul, only for Palmer to see his firm effort from the spot excellently pushed away from the bottom corner by Hermansen. Leicester then went close at the other end, with Chelsea only able to watch as Tosin nodded onto his own crossbar after Robert Sanchez misjudged the flight of a cross. Leicester offered little in their attempts for an equaliser but needed Hermansen to keep the scoreline down with a late save to keep out Enzo Fernandez as Chelsea edged over the line. Cole needs a goal
Chelsea got there in the end, but it is clear that Palmer is suffering his first true dip in form since signing for the club. Palmer made his presence known in his 72 minutes on the field; he had more shots than anyone, including an unfortunate one that was blocked by his own team-mate, while lining up efforts from distance in trademark fashion, but they were flying off target. He remained heavily involved in Chelsea’s attacking efforts, and the feeling is that if one goes in it will get things moving again. There is no doubt a run this long without a goal is uncharacteristic and could not have been predicted after Palmer netted 14 times in his first 23 appearances of the season. Palmer's own drought has coincided with Chelsea's dip in form and while they picked up three points on this occasion, they will be hoping he can rediscover his shooting boots as they continue their fight for a top-four finish, with Arsenal up next in the league. Foxes' fight falls short
Leicester had lost 12 of their 14 previous league matches and are entrenched in the bottom three, but there was no sign that they are resigned to their fate at Stamford Bridge. Hermansen, meanwhile, is a stand-out performer and looks to have a big future at this level, excellently standing up to the threat Chelsea did show, with a special moment from Cucurella needed to beat him.

Hermansen, meanwhile, is a stand-out performer and looks to have a big future at this level, excellently standing up to the threat Chelsea did show, with a special moment from Cucurella needed to beat him. Their lack of goals is also proving a worry as they have lacked the firepower to win the points required, and next week’s meeting with former club Manchester United looks a vital one for the Leicester head coach.

The forward kicked the corner flag in celebration as a tribute to team-mate Jean-Philippe Mateta who suffered a head injury against Millwall last week. The win sees Palace move up to 11th place in the Premier League table, while Ipswich remain in 18th and five points adrift of safety. How the match unfolded
Palace had a glorious chance inside two minutes as a delicious pass from Adam Wharton set Nketiah through on goal, but Palmer rushed out to thwart his poked effort. A fine Jacob Greaves block then denied Eberechi Eze from close range as the hosts continued to probe, though Ipswich went close minutes later as Julio Enciso’s thunderous strike was tipped over the bar by Dean Henderson. Eze’s cross deflected off Dara O’Shea onto a post as Palace searched for the breakthrough early in the second half. Palace find a way without Mateta
Sprits were high heading into the game for Palace, with brilliant recent form in the league and potential FA Cup semi-final away on the horizon after their win over Millwall in the fifth round. The only blot from that result was the serious injury sustained by Jean-Philippe Mateta, and his replacement Nketiah was presented with a glorious early chance to score for the third successive game. Wharton created that chance with a wonderful pass forward and he controlled the tempo for the home side in the first half, with the England international now enjoying his best run of form of the season after mostly enduring a frustratingly injury-hit campaign. Glasner’s side greatly missed the presence of Mateta as a true focal point in terms of leading the line but pushed for the all-important winner which emerged through Sarr, who had moved centrally for the final part of the match. Palace now have three weeks to prepare for their quarter-final against Fulham in the FA Cup, before returning to Premier League action against Southampton three days later. Though Ipswich struggled to sustain possession at times, they still did carry a threat, with Enciso and Jack Clarke forcing saves from Henderson while the physicality of the spirited Delap caused aerial problems for the Palace defenders.

36,36,manchester-united,2025-02-26,"Harry Maguire secured 10-man Manchester United a first Premier League win since January, edging Ipswich Town 3-2 at Old Trafford. United had staged a first-half comeback, with Sam Morsy’s own goal and Matthijs de Ligt’s close-range finish flipping the script after Jaden Philogene profited from an early defensive mix-up. United moved up to 14th on 33 points, but Ipswich, who are yet to win a league game in 2025, remain third-bottom and five points behind Wolverhampton Wanderers. How the match unfolded
Ipswich were gifted the opener after a terrible mix-up just four minutes in with Dorgu kicking the ball past Andre Onana, who had rushed off his line, leaving Philogene with the easiest of tap-ins at an empty net. United got a stroke of luck for the equaliser as Bruno Fernandes’ curling free-kick was headed into his own net by the unsuspecting Morsy. However, Dorgu was then sent off by the referee following a VAR review after catching Hutchinson with his studs, and Ipswich equalised on the stroke of half-time, Philogene curling in a cross that flew past the stranded Onana. The hosts got an early goal of their own in the second half, as Fernandes’ corner was thumped into the net by a stooping Maguire. Ipswich applied pressure, going close through Philogene, who tested Onana with a whipped shot from the edge of the box late on, but they could not find another equaliser. United stop Old Trafford rot
United’s comeback against Everton to earn a 2-2 draw did little to ease the pressure on the team and, though they won on Wednesday, it was far from convincing. Audible groans were heard from the Old Trafford crowd after Philogene’s first goal, with a lack of communication leading to neither Dorgu nor Onana properly dealing with Morsy’s long ball over the top. United responded well to the early setback though, with Maguire’s fine thumping header kept out by Palmer before they eventually found parity through Morsy’s own goal – their first from open play in the first half of a Premier League game since early December. Any goodwill that De Ligt had earned with his poached finish was reversed following Dorgu’s red and Onana’s indecisiveness as Philogene’s cross snuck into the far post. Fernandes continued to provide a threat from set-pieces though and, having picked out Maguire a few times in the first half, they finally got it right shortly after the break, with the defender sneaking in front of Philogene to meet it. After a shaky defensive showing in the first half, United looked well-drilled in the second, throwing bodies on the line to make continuous blocks to end a run of three Premier League games without a win. Chance goes begging for Ipswich
Kieran McKenna said he was “relishing” his return to Old Trafford, where he worked as a coach under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and knew a win could give them a huge boost in the fight for Premier League survival. Liam Delap had already dragged a shot wide before Philogene gave them the lead, but Ipswich could not maintain their quick start, instead dropping deep to deal with United’s growing threat. With a numerical advantage against a United side that are struggling, they could not hope for a better opportunity to earn their first win since beating Chelsea in December, but they could not impose themselves in the second half. They dominated possession and made some promising inroads through Philogene and Delap, while piling on the pressure, though they struggled to test Onana. With time running out, they resorted to long-range strikes that United were happy to deal with. Club reports

City lost 5-1 to Arsenal in their last top-flight outing and came into Saturday’s contest at the Etihad Stadium on the back of a last-gasp UEFA Champions League defeat to Real Madrid on Tuesday. The 26-year-old opened his City account with a lob from Ederson’s raking pass, then fired low into the bottom corner for his second before side-footing in his third just after the half-hour. Marmoush went off to a standing ovation before substitute James McAtee rounded out a comprehensive victory that leaves City three places and as many points clear of seventh-placed Newcastle. How the match unfolded
City’s reward for a fine start came in the 19th minute as Ederson floated a sublime pass over Newcastle’s defence and Marmoush lofted a weighted finish over Martin Dubravka. Ederson beat away a fierce attempt from substitute Lewis Miley as Newcastle showed green shoots of recovery in the second half, though City swiftly quashed any further signs of revival. Marmoush was able to receive the plaudits from the home faithful when he made way off in the 76th minute, eight minutes before McAtee added further gloss as he hooked in from point-blank range following Haaland’s flick-on from a corner. Magnificent Marmoush makes his mark
Only Harry Kane had scored more Bundesliga goals this season than Marmoush prior to the Egyptian’s move from Eintracht Frankfurt to City last month, so Pep Guardiola knew he was getting a top-tier finisher. And after some bright signs in his opening matches, Marmoush’s City career is now truly up and running. His hat-trick was City’s fourth-fastest in the club’s Premier League history (between the first and third goals), and his finishes displayed the variety he has in his locker. It might have been more for City in the first half – Savinho should have done better when put through by Phil Foden, and Erling Haaland saw a dangerous cross diverted just wide by Dan Burn. It will particularly please Guardiola that, on this occasion, City did not run the risk of allowing Newcastle back into the match. Guardiola, who was dealt some concern when Haaland went down clutching his knee late on, though the striker appeared to be okay as he made his way to the bench, will now want to see this level of performance in City’s huge encounters next week. Newcastle leave the Etihad empty-handed again
Newcastle have now lost their last 16 visits to City in the Premier League and remain winless at the Etihad Stadium in the competition. But even accounting for the Magpies’ torrid record at City, their first-half display will have deeply disappointed Howe. Newcastle’s defence was unable to cope with the movement of City’s fluid front line, with Savinho stretching the pitch down one side, and Marmoush able to drop into pockets of space alongside Foden ahead of the visiting defence.

While they are not the first team, and will not be the last, to fall foul of Ederson’s excellent passing range, Newcastle’s defence was static as Marmoush darted behind the line for the opener, and Trippier could not keep pace. It was no shock to see Howe take off the 34-year-old at the interval. After back-to-back league defeats, Howe will want to see a response when Newcastle host Nottingham Forest next week. Club reports

Yoane Wissa headed the Bees in front in first-half stoppage time with his 13th league goal of the season. But Everton – for whom the in-form Beto saw two golden opportunities go begging prior to Wissa’s opener – ensured a share of the spoils when O’Brien nodded in Vitalii Mykolenko’s 77th-minute cross. Thomas Frank’s Brentford remain 11th, though they are now without a win in six top-flight home matches. How the match unfolded
Brentford demonstrated the greater attacking intent early on with Keane Lewis-Potter drilling narrowly wide from distance, but having weathered the storm, Everton saw two great chances to take the lead go begging. The in-form Beto raced through on goal twice in the space of three minutes – the first following an untimely Ethan Pinnock slip – but he was denied by the alert Mark Flekken on both occasions. Brentford made their goalkeeper’s good work count on the stroke of half-time. Everton failed to deal with a long throw and Wissa nodded home after Bryan Mbeumo’s initial header ricocheted off the crossbar. After a period of Everton pressure, Wissa thought he had doubled Brentford’s lead when he tucked home in the 69th minute, only for his joy to be cut short by the offside flag. They almost snatched all three points but Beto, from a tight angle, was thwarted by Flekken once more. The Brazilian seemed to be caught in two minds with his first opportunity, while Flekken’s smart reflex save denied him the second time. Bees lose their sting at home
The Gtech Community Stadium was a fortress for Brentford earlier this season. The Bees have not won at home in the league since early December, and they are yet to register a clean sheet on home soil in the top flight this campaign. Frank’s team did seem to be heading towards all three points, though, and will have been especially buoyed when Beto spurned those huge chances before Wissa’s opener, for which the forward demonstrated wonderful determination to pounce on the loose ball and head home. Although disappointed not to get that home win on the board, Frank will be encouraging his players to stay upbeat ahead of a difficult run of fixtures, starting at home against Aston Villa on 8 March.",Brentford_2025-02-26,everton,thomas-frank,david-moyes,1,1,27,3,1,52,1.48,2,12,3,2,3,458,13,6,2,0,3,1,6,3,8,4,1,1,31,1,1,384,21,56,25,0,52,4,26,15,9,13,9,48,24,0,3,1.3591,0,3,11,48,1.37,3,14,2,5,6,425,15,3,1,0,4,0,8,2,7,7,2,0,17,1,0,351,23,47,26,0,48,7,22,16,4,15,4,47,33,0,2,-0.1099,1,0,8

But Everton – for whom the in-form Beto saw two golden opportunities go begging prior to Wissa’s opener – ensured a share of the spoils when O’Brien nodded in Vitalii Mykolenko’s 77th-minute cross.

Everton capitalised on that let-off by clawing themselves level 13 minutes from time, as a well-worked move culminated in O’Brien losing his marker to head home Mykolenko’s cross. Resurgent Toffees keep rolling
David Moyes has enjoyed a fine start to his second Everton tenure, and will no doubt be pleased with the resilience shown by his under-manned side on Wednesday. With key midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure absent, Everton did not have many options to call on from the bench, but their equaliser came from a player who has been rejuvenated under Moyes. O’Brien had not got much of a look-in under Sean Dyche, but has been a regular – albeit not playing in his natural position – under Moyes, and the Republic of Ireland international came up big when it mattered. Everton did ride their luck early on, though Beto – fresh from scoring in four successive matches – will have been disappointed not to continue that impressive streak. Now 15 points clear of the relegation zone – and with Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Ham United next up – Everton will have two opportunities to put even more distance between themselves and danger. However, an inability to increase their advantage eventually proved costly, and Everton capitalised, having built up a steady head of steam through the second half.",Everton_2025-02-26,brentford,david-moyes,thomas-frank,1,1,27,3,0,48,1.37,3,14,2,5,6,425,15,3,1,0,4,0,8,2,7,7,2,0,17,1,0,351,23,47,26,0,48,7,22,16,4,15,4,47,33,0,2,-0.1099,1,0,8,52,1.48,2,12,3,2,3,458,13,6,2,0,3,1,6,3,8,4,1,1,31,1,1,384,21,56,25,0,52,4,26,15,9,13,9,48,24,0,3,1.3591,0,3,11
42,42,everton,2025-02-12,"James Tarkowski struck a 98th-minute equaliser as Everton claimed a dramatic 2-2 draw against Liverpool in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, stopping the visitors from going nine points clear at the top of the Premier League. Beto had been the beneficiary from an innovative Everton set piece to put the home side ahead in the first half, but goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Mohamed Salah flipped Wednesday's match on its head. Tarkowski fired a terrific finish into the top-right corner to spark wild scenes among the home fans, before Curtis Jones, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Arne Slot were all shown red cards after the final whistle. Everton climb one place in the table to go 15th, while Liverpool remain top of the pile and their bid for a 20th top-flight title continues. How the match unfolded
Some quick thinking from Jarrad Branthwaite saw Everton take the lead on 11 minutes. But that advantage was short-lived as Mac Allister glanced Salah's deft cross beyond Jordan Pickford and into the bottom-left corner. A feisty first half ended level, with Liverpool going close in stoppage time as Tarkowski slid in to prevent Luis Diaz turning home after Pickford fumbled Dominik Szoboszlai's effort. Everton started the second half well and thought they had restored their lead in the 68th minute. Branthwaite blasted home from close range, but the offside flag went up against Jake O'Brien in the build-up. Liverpool made the most of that reprieve five minutes later, Salah converting into an empty net after Curtis Jones was denied by Branthwaite's block. But there was to be one final twist, Tarkowski smashing home on the volley to snatch a point for Everton, with the on-field decision to award the goal confirmed following a VAR check for a possible offside. Grand derby farewell for Goodison
David Moyes' last Merseyside derby in charge of Everton before this one was a goalless draw at Anfield in May 2013, a result that helped the Toffees finish above their neighbours in the Premier League that campaign. The city's two clubs are now at opposite ends of the table, but Moyes ensured Everton's supporters enjoyed the final instalment of this rivalry to take place at their famous old stadium. Even the loss of Iliman Ndiaye, who looked distraught as he limped off to join Everton's lengthy injury list midway through the first half, did not slow Everton, who looked the likelier scorers early in the second half. Salah's goal out of nowhere could have sucked the confidence out of them, but Tarkowski rewarded the home fans for their raucous support with a moment to remember. Arriving unmarked onto substitute Tim Iroegbunam's flick-on, Tarkowski gave Alisson no chance with a ferocious finish into the roof of the net, prompting several over-excited fans to spill onto the playing surface amid the wild celebrations. Many Everton supporters were still in the stands singing long after the full-time whistle sounded, and this result should provide the Toffees with a boost ahead of Saturday's trip to Crystal Palace. Liverpool flunk derby test
Coming into the match on the back of a demoralising FA Cup elimination at the hands of Plymouth Argyle, Slot had warned Liverpool to expect one of their toughest tests at Goodison Park. Young full-back Conor Bradley, who has enjoyed a strong campaign overall, played Beto onside for Everton's first goal. Liverpool, however, would have to survive one last push from the hosts, and neither Virgil van Dijk nor Ibrahima Konate covered themselves in glory for Tarkowski's goal. Both Jones and head coach Slot – as well as Everton's Doucoure – then saw red after the final whistle, as players and coaches from both teams clashed. Club reports

Coming into the match on the back of a demoralising FA Cup elimination at the hands of Plymouth Argyle, Slot had warned Liverpool to expect one of their toughest tests at Goodison Park. Though Mac Allister quickly got Liverpool back on level terms after the shock of Beto's opener, Liverpool looked rattled at times. Already booked and among a tough battle at the back Slot decided to replace Bradley. His replacement Jones played a key role in Liverpool's second goal, with his blocked shot falling nicely for Salah to prod home. Liverpool, however, would have to survive one last push from the hosts, and neither Virgil van Dijk nor Ibrahima Konate covered themselves in glory for Tarkowski's goal. Both Jones and head coach Slot – as well as Everton's Doucoure – then saw red after the final whistle, as players and coaches from both teams clashed.

44,44,chelsea,2025-01-20,"Chelsea ended their five-match winless streak in the Premier League with a 3-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge on Monday. Tosin Adarabioyo, Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke were all on target as the Blues climbed back into the top four. However, Cucurella and Madueke struck in the space of five second-half minutes to seal a much-needed triumph for the Blues. Enzo Maresca’s side leapfrogged Newcastle United and Manchester City to fourth place, while Wolves remain 17th and only outside the relegation zone on goal difference. How the match unfolded
Chelsea quickly established their authority on proceedings as Cole Palmer shot narrowly wide, before he called Jose Sa into action with a low drive soon after. The breakthrough seemed inevitable, and it arrived in the 24th minute when Reece James' shot deflected kindly for Tosin, who calmly tucked away, with the goal disallowed on-pitch for offside, but overturned after a VAR review. The Blues regained their advantage in the 60th minute when Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall flicked on Madueke’s cross, and the unmarked Cucurella was on hand to control and finish on his 100th Premier League appearance. Madueke then got in on the act five minutes later, with the England international nodding home on the line after the returning Trevoh Chalobah headed Palmer’s corner towards goal. The offside flag then denied Nicolas Jackson a fourth late on but, by then, the damage was done, and Chelsea were back to winning ways. Blues bounce back
After Newcastle United were well-beaten by AFC Bournemouth on Saturday, Chelsea knew this was a good opportunity to displace the Magpies in the top four. However, the Blues had dropped seven points from winning positions in their last four league matches, and they must have had that sinking feeling when Doherty equalised just before half-time. Despite the brief scare, it was a generally comfortable win for the Blues, and a timely confidence booster ahead of their trip to the Etihad Stadium to face a revitalised Manchester City on Saturday. When Tosin broke the deadlock, Wolves had failed to register a touch inside Chelsea’s box. However, Cucurella was left unmarked in the box to meet Madueke’s deflected cross, before Wolves’ set-piece frailties were exposed again with Palmer’s corner leading to the Blues’ third goal.

46,46,bournemouth,2025-01-25,"Dango Ouattara scored a hat-trick to end Nottingham Forest’s eight-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League as AFC Bournemouth eased to a 5-0 victory on Saturday. Justin Kluivert continued his recent hot streak to open the scoring at the Vitality Stadium, netting his fifth goal in three top-flight games in the ninth minute. The Cherries moved further in front shortly after the restart when Kluivert clipped a delicate ball into the box for Ouattara to loop a header over Matz Sels, before skipping past Murillo to score again six minutes later. The triumph moves Andoni Iraola’s side up to sixth in the standings, while Forest remain third, but now sit nine points behind leaders Liverpool. Bournemouth’s dominance was eventually rewarded 10 minutes after the break when Ouattara met Kluivert’s cross into the area with a guided header over Sels. The Cherries, however, were not to be denied a third goal, with Ouattara notching his second of the game following a dazzling run that ended with an assured finish. The 22-year-old grabbed his hat-trick three minutes from time, reacting first to Marcus Tavernier’s spilled effort from Sels, before Semenyo slotted in a fine finish to round things off. Cherry on the cake
Bournemouth’s quest for European football continued in stunning fashion, making light work of a defence that has rarely been breached in the Premier League this season. Ryan Christie called Sels into first-half action before David Brooks curled his effort narrowly wide as Bournemouth responded positively after overcoming a wave of Forest pressure in reply to their opener. But for all the plaudits their attack has received this season, their success has been built from the back, with Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi forming an excellent partnership in central defence. The Cherries have not lost a game since the pair first played 10 games ago. That solid base allowed the hosts to flourish in the second half, with Ouattara and Kluivert impressing once again, while there were also two assists in midfield from Tyler Adams, with the Cherries looking a complete outfit under Iraola. Semenyo’s brilliantly taken finish late on after a relatively quiet encounter further highlighted Bournemouth’s quality all over the pitch, with European football a real possibility for them this season. The Cherries will be tested by one of the division’s top teams once again next week, welcoming Liverpool to the Vitality Stadium next Saturday. Forest falter on the South Coast
Just under three years ago, Forest lost 1-0 to Bournemouth at the Vitality, sealing the Cherries’ promotion to the Premier League, and they endured another difficult outing on the South coast. Forest threatened to open the scoring in the first minute when Anthony Elanga stung the palms of Kepa but allowed their opponents to take control of the opening stages, which resulted in Kluivert putting the Cherries ahead with relative ease after not being closed down. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side rarely troubled Bournemouth’s defence for much of the contest, with Callum Hudson-Odoi, who has been a pivotal figure in their attack this season, missing from the contest, with his pace and precision in the final third playing its part in their second-half collapse.

47,47,nottingham-forest,2025-01-25,"Dango Ouattara scored a hat-trick to end Nottingham Forest’s eight-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League as AFC Bournemouth eased to a 5-0 victory on Saturday. The Cherries moved further in front shortly after the restart when Kluivert clipped a delicate ball into the box for Ouattara to loop a header over Matz Sels, before skipping past Murillo to score again six minutes later. The triumph moves Andoni Iraola’s side up to sixth in the standings, while Forest remain third, but now sit nine points behind leaders Liverpool. But Forest almost got themselves level less than a minute later when Ryan Yates saw his bouncing volley saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga, with Morgan Gibbs-White also going close. Ryan Christie called Sels into first-half action before David Brooks curled his effort narrowly wide as Bournemouth responded positively after overcoming a wave of Forest pressure in reply to their opener. Forest falter on the South Coast
Just under three years ago, Forest lost 1-0 to Bournemouth at the Vitality, sealing the Cherries’ promotion to the Premier League, and they endured another difficult outing on the South coast. Forest threatened to open the scoring in the first minute when Anthony Elanga stung the palms of Kepa but allowed their opponents to take control of the opening stages, which resulted in Kluivert putting the Cherries ahead with relative ease after not being closed down. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side rarely troubled Bournemouth’s defence for much of the contest, with Callum Hudson-Odoi, who has been a pivotal figure in their attack this season, missing from the contest, with his pace and precision in the final third playing its part in their second-half collapse. Elanga had the visitors’ best efforts after the break, striking the crossbar on two occasions, first with a free-kick that clipped the upright before cannoning an effort from the edge of the box and onto the woodwork. Forest will be hoping to return to winning ways against Brighton & Hove Albion in their next Premier League assignment. Club reports

There was a sense of optimism surrounding Portman Road ahead of kick-off, but City ruthlessly shattered any hopes of a monumental upset. Having started brightly but failing to test Ederson, Ipswich were unable to lay a glove on the champions who took control in the 15th minute, though Omari Hutchinson did blaze a glorious chance over moments before Foden opened the scoring. Ipswich’s run of games does not get any easier, with a trip to Anfield to face leaders Liverpool up next, before they return to Portman Road to take on fellow strugglers Southampton at the start of February.

49,49,manchester-city,2025-01-19,"Manchester City’s revival in 2025 continued as they surged into the Premier League’s top four after thumping Ipswich Town 6-0 at Portman Road on Sunday. Phil Foden starred for Pep Guardiola’s side, with his assist for Mateo Kovacic sandwiched in between two close-range finishes in the first half, both set up by captain Kevin De Bruyne. The visitors pulled further clear after the break, with Jack Clarke’s sloppy pass into midfield punished by Jeremy Doku, whose strike took a deflection off Dara O'Shea on its way through. And in the week of signing a new nine-and-a-half-year contract, Erling Haaland got himself on the scoresheet before substitute James McAtee rounded off the scoring in the 69th minute. City jump up into the final UEFA Champions League place at the expense of Newcastle United on goal difference. How the match unfolded
After Haaland had missed an earlier opportunity to open the scoring, the Citizens found the opener 27 minutes in as Foden turned in De Bruyne's deflected cross. The England international turned provider for City’s second of the match three minutes later, teeing up Kovacic, who found the bottom left-hand corner from the edge of the box. The visitors extended their lead before the break as De Bruyne and Foden combined again, with the latter squeezing the ball under Christian Walton for his second successive brace away from home in the Premier League. Four minutes after the restart, Doku added to their tally following a stunning solo run, with Haaland then netting his 17th league goal of the campaign before the hour-mark. Ipswich outclassed by revitalised champions
There was a sense of optimism surrounding Portman Road ahead of kick-off, but City ruthlessly shattered any hopes of a monumental upset. Having started brightly but failing to test Ederson, Ipswich were unable to lay a glove on the champions who took control in the 15th minute, though Omari Hutchinson did blaze a glorious chance over moments before Foden opened the scoring. But perhaps the most telling moment of the difference in quality came when Ben Johnson stung the palms of Ederson following a lightning counter-attack, only for Doku to put the visitors 4-0 to the good at the other end mere moments later. Though City rung the changes with the contest won early in the second half, the hosts were unable to match their opponents’ quality in reserve, with the only positives being the debuts for the newly-signed Godfrey and Jaden Philogene. New year, new Foden
In the midst of City’s unprecedented turn of form towards the end of last year, Foden more than most was a player supporters were looking to see more from, having notched 39 goal involvements in 53 appearances across all competitions for the Citizens in 2023/24. But he has since found his form for Guardiola’s side, showcasing why he is one of the most supreme talents in the top flight. City should have gone ahead early on when De Bruyne slipped in Haaland, but the Norwegian saw his finish tipped over by Walton, with the resulting corner seeing Doku test the Tractor Boys’ goalkeeper at his near post. Jens Cajuste then had his pocket picked by Ilkay Gundogan which ended in Kovacic firing over the crossbar, but City were able to assert their dominance in double-quick time, with Foden playing a starring role in their three first-half strikes. As the visitors pulled further clear, Guardiola was able to make changes, with Foden, De Bruyne and Haaland all withdrawn with one eye on their Champions League trip to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.

50,50,crystal-palace,2025-04-19,"Crystal Palace overcame the challenge of playing the whole of the second half with 10 men to hold AFC Bournemouth to a 0-0 draw, denting the Cherries' hopes of European qualification. Palace, who had conceded 10 goals across their previous two matches against Manchester City and Newcastle United, had to play more than half of this contest with a numerical disadvantage after Chris Richards was dismissed for a second bookable offence. Bournemouth stay eighth and are five points adrift of seventh-placed Chelsea, who visit west London rivals Fulham on Sunday, while Palace remain five points behind Andoni Iraola’s side in 12th. Palace were reduced to 10 men in first-half stoppage time, with Richards shown a second yellow card after he was deemed to have dragged Justin Kluivert back. Jean-Philippe Mateta also attempted an acrobatic effort that was never going to trouble the goalkeeper. Palace tighten up at the back
Palace came into this contest desperate to stop the rot. But Glasner’s side had won their last three Premier League home matches, with Mateta scoring 18 times in 22 league appearances at Selhurst Park, where Eberechi Eze had been directly involved in 19 goals in 30 league games. Nevertheless, Palace can take positives from the way they stood firm defensively following Richards’ red card to ensure a clean sheet. That is what Glasner will be urging his players to focus on ahead of travelling to Arsenal in midweek, before attention turns to their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Saturday. Club reports

Bournemouth stay eighth and are five points adrift of seventh-placed Chelsea, who visit west London rivals Fulham on Sunday, while Palace remain five points behind Andoni Iraola’s side in 12th. Bournemouth increased the pressure late on as they desperately tried to capitalise on their numerical advantage, but they did so without success and were forced to settle for a point. Missed chance for Cherries?
Bournemouth, meanwhile, were fresh from stopping a rot of their own. Iraola’s side had gone six matches in all competitions without victory before edging out Fulham 1-0 on Monday. With seventh-placed Villa playing high-flying Newcastle later on Saturday, the Cherries knew this was a decent opportunity to potentially close the gap to just three points heading into the last five games of the Premier League season. With Evanilson scoring six times in nine league appearances away from the Vitality Stadium and Kluivert starting behind the Brazilian, Iraola will have been confident in their chances. The run-in will certainly test Bournemouth’s credentials in their quest for European football. Club reports

Enzo Maresca’s side knew a win at Goodison Park would put them at least temporarily top, with Liverpool facing Tottenham Hotspur later on Sunday, but the Blues were left frustrated by a strong defensive display from the Toffees. Nicolas Jackson spurned two big chances in the first half, as he was thwarted by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and then the woodwork. Chelsea had nearly 75 per cent possession but Everton, in their first match since being taken over by The Friedkin Group, had the best two opportunities after the break, with Jack Harrison fluffing his lines before Tosin Adarabioyo made a fantastic block to deny Iliman Ndiaye. Everton are now 15th, four points clear of the bottom three. How the match unfolded
Jackson might feel he should have done better when presented with the clearest chance of the match in the 26th minute, but the striker failed to beat Pickford from point-blank range. The woodwork came to Everton’s rescue when Jackson met Enzo Fernandez’s corner, with Pickford and Vitalii Mykolenko flying out to deny Malo Gusto on the rebound. Everton finally threatened towards the end of the half – Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez keeping out a long-range shot from Orel Mangala with an outstretched hand. Sanchez had to be alert again shortly after the restart, as he spread himself to close down Harrison’s shot from inside the area. This frustration would continue in the second half, as clear-cut chances continued to be few and far between against a well-drilled Everton defence, who were buoyed by restricting Chelsea’s London rivals Arsenal to a goalless draw last week. New era begins with a Dyche special
There had been plenty of optimism going into this match for Everton, following the finalising of The Friedkin Group’s takeover of the club. This pre-match positivity was followed by a gritty display, with Sean Dyche deciding to stick with the exact same side that managed a credible draw away to Arsenal last weekend. Everton were forced to soak up plenty of early pressure, with Pickford standing firm when required, first to keep out Neto’s effort before making a far more impressive stop to deny Jackson breaking the deadlock. James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite turned in a fine performance ahead of Pickford, helping the Toffees to a seventh league clean sheet of the campaign. Had Harrison shown a bit more composure when he found himself one-on-one with Sanchez, or Adarabioyo not timed his tackle on Ndiaye perfectly, Everton may well have helped themselves to an early Christmas treat.

The woodwork came to Everton’s rescue when Jackson met Enzo Fernandez’s corner, with Pickford and Vitalii Mykolenko flying out to deny Malo Gusto on the rebound. Everton finally threatened towards the end of the half – Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez keeping out a long-range shot from Orel Mangala with an outstretched hand. And despite their dominance of the ball, Chelsea were ultimately indebted to Adarabioyo when the defender lunged in to block Ndiaye’s close-range effort in the 78th minute, as the Blues saw a five-match winning streak in the league come to an end. Chelsea’s charge held up
Maresca has consistently played down his team’s chances of battling for the title, but a win on Sunday would have put them ahead of Liverpool, albeit having played a fixture more by the time the weekend is up. It would have been the first time Chelsea topped the table since December 2021, when Thomas Tuchel was in charge. After a frenzied start, they controlled most of the first half but still struggled to create too many openings, with the likes of Pedro Neto and Cole Palmer not allowed much space in between the lines, albeit the latter did still craft that first opening for Jackson with a square ball across the box. This frustration would continue in the second half, as clear-cut chances continued to be few and far between against a well-drilled Everton defence, who were buoyed by restricting Chelsea’s London rivals Arsenal to a goalless draw last week. Jackson has had a fine season, but despite scoring against Brentford last time out, he was wasteful in that win at Stamford Bridge, and he will surely come away from this one thinking he should have had at least one goal. If they are to challenge for the title, then these are the types of tests Chelsea will have to come through with all three points. Everton were forced to soak up plenty of early pressure, with Pickford standing firm when required, first to keep out Neto’s effort before making a far more impressive stop to deny Jackson breaking the deadlock.

The Jamaica international scored in the 76th minute, restoring Villa’s lead after Stephy Mavididi’s equaliser, as he turned in the all-important goal from an Ian Maatsen cross. After a cagey first half with few chances, the match finally opened up after the break, with Ross Barkley striking home the opener for Villa just before the hour mark. The defeat keeps Leicester in 19th with 14 points, two behind Wolverhampton Wanderers in 17th, while Villa move up to eighth on 32 points. How the match unfolded
Both sides struggled to create anything of note in the first half, with Ollie Watkins' deflected effort the clearest opening until stoppage time. Watkins’ cross created problems for the Leicester defence, and goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk had to present a strong fist to stop Matty Cash’s strike from the edge of the box. He scored on the rebound after Villa custodian Emiliano Martinez kept out Jamie Vardy’s initial attempt. Injury-hit Villa get the job done
Villa were on a slight blip before Saturday, with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City their only win in four outings, and Unai Emery had to contend with injuries and suspension as his side kicked off 2025 with a victory. Emery already had centre-back Pau Torres sidelined for up to two months while Diego Carlos and Jaden Philogene also missed out with knocks going into the match. Morgan Rogers and Jhon Duran, who have 13 league goals between them this season, were both suspended, and the Villa manager’s woes were then compounded when captain John McGinn was forced off injured less than 20 minutes in. But Barkley, in his first start since a goalscoring display against Crystal Palace in November, and Bailey, with his first goal of the season, stepped up for Emery’s side in their moment of difficulty. Watkins and substitute Emiliano Buendia also had opportunities to increase the home side’s advantage in the resulting chaos, but the Argentinian scuffed his shot into Leicester’s defence before Watkins blazed over from close range. Spirited displays against champions Man City and Villa aside, they are in desperate need of points, with only rock-bottom Southampton, on six points, below them in the Premier League table. They have conceded 16 goals in their last six matches and their defensive frailties were again on display at Villa Park as Danish centre-back Vestergaard’s poor defensive header from a Youri Tielemans cross led to the opener.

The Cherries had not lost a home match on Boxing Day since 2003, though they were not quite packing the necessary punch this time around. Nevertheless, Iraola’s side looked the more likely of the two teams to score. While Bournemouth looked the more threatening of the two sides, Palace did have the ball in the net at the Vitality Stadium, albeit after Sarr had strayed offside. Club reports

However, Andoni Iraola’s side were forced to settle for a point, with Palace extending their unbeaten away streak to five league games. Oliver Glasner’s Palace are 16th and move five points clear of the relegation zone. How the match unfolded
Jean-Philippe Mateta and Dango Ouattara both shot narrowly wide in the opening 20 minutes, while Ismaila Sarr made an important clearance from Antoine Semenyo inside the six-yard box. Sarr thought he had put Palace ahead at the other end when he calmly raced away from the defence and tucked home, only to be denied by the offside flag. Eberechi Eze tested Kepa Arrizabalaga from distance and, moments later, Enes Unal could not quite divert Justin Kluivert’s shot beyond Dean Henderson. Palace extend unbeaten away streak
Palace have not enjoyed much festive cheer recently – each of their last three Boxing Day matches had ended in 3-0 defeats. While Bournemouth looked the more threatening of the two sides, Palace did have the ball in the net at the Vitality Stadium, albeit after Sarr had strayed offside. Glasner’s side also remained firm at the other end of the field, securing only a second clean sheet in 10 matches across all competitions. That is one of three successive home games to come for Palace, who now turn their attention towards ending a run of four matches without victory at Selhurst Park. Club reports

58,58,southampton,2024-12-04,"Chelsea continued their fine recent form with a 5-1 victory away to struggling Southampton to go second on goal difference. They went in front early on through Axel Disasi’s header but were quickly pegged back as Joe Aribo fired home an equaliser for the home side. A miserable night for Southampton was made more difficult when Jack Stephens was shown a red card by the referee in the first half following a VAR review, after an entanglement with Marc Cucurella. The result sees Chelsea move up to second, while Southampton remain at the foot of the table. How the match unfolded
The home side had a glorious chance within the first two minutes of the match, but Filip Jorgensen made a fantastic save to deny Aribo from close range. But the Saints weren’t behind for long, as Aribo made up for his earlier miss with an easy finish after Kyle Walker-Peters supplied a neat cut back from the left. It got even worse for the hosts before half-time, with the referee giving Stephens a red card for violent conduct following a VAR review after the Saints captain had pulled Cucurella's hair. Sorry Saints continue poor run at foot of the table
Despite their position in the table, Russell Martin would have been encouraged by recent performances against Liverpool and Brighton, in which his side had been competitive and perhaps deserved more than their solitary point. But, apart from a frenetic opening in which Aribo scored and missed a wonderful opportunity, they were second-best. Defensive errors, regrettably a trademark of Martin’s side this season, were on full display again. The Saints were cut open on far too many occasions, predominantly in the first half, and they are now already in serious danger of being cut adrift in the fight to stave off relegation, seven points from safety with 14 matches played. The returning Madueke was a menace for the Saints' defence, getting on the scoresheet but also having other chances in the second half. Club reports

The away side reclaimed the lead through goals from Christopher Nkunku and Noni Madueke, before Cole Palmer and substitute Jadon Sancho added further gloss in the second half. The result sees Chelsea move up to second, while Southampton remain at the foot of the table. Just minutes later, they were left to rue that missed opportunity as Disasi got in ahead of keeper Joe Lumley and headed in from a corner to put Chelsea in front. With 15 minutes to go, Palmer extended Chelsea’s lead with an easy finish before Sancho capped an impressive night for the visitors. Lumley’s playing out from the back led to Nkunku putting Chelsea back in front and also created other openings for their opponents. Maresca rotates but Blues still shine
Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca made seven changes from the side that beat Aston Villa on Sunday, but that did nothing to disrupt his side’s fluency and attacking flair. Joao Felix also dovetailed with Palmer in central attacking areas. Their strength in depth in the attacking areas was highlighted with Nicolas Jackson being rested for the entire match, while Sancho came off the bench to grab his first goal for the club.

60,60,tottenham-hotspur,2024-12-08,"Cole Palmer's penalty double completed a remarkable 4-3 victory over Tottenham Hotspur as Chelsea moved within four points of Premier League leaders Liverpool. Chelsea thumped nine-man Spurs 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last season but required an almighty fightback as Marc Cucurella's errors gifted the hosts an early 2-0 lead at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Dominic Solanke's well-taken opener and Dejan Kulusevski's pinpoint finish puts Spurs two goals up before Jadon Sancho reduced the arrears with a delightful finish. Son Heung-min’s stoppage-time strike teed up a nervy ending for Chelsea, but they held firm to move two points clear of Arsenal in second and make ground on Liverpool, while Spurs sit 11th after a second defeat in the space of three days. How the match unfolded
Cucurella's untimely slip near the halfway line allowed Brennan Johnson to burst down the right, and Solanke stretched in front of Levi Colwill to fire Spurs into the fifth-minute lead from the winger’s low cross. Pedro Porro nipped in when Cucurella again lost his footing just six minutes later, before Kulusevski cut inside and picked out the bottom-right corner with a pinpoint finish. Yves Bissouma's challenge on Moises Caicedo saw Palmer level from 12 yards in the 61st minute, and Fernandez then hammered past the helpless Forster to put Chelsea ahead. The Spurs goalkeeper was left on the floor when Palmer – fouled by Sarr for the second spot-kick – chipped his 84th-minute penalty down the middle, as Son's late goal from James Maddison's cutback pass proved a mere consolation. A damaging defeat for Postecoglou
Some Spurs supporters made their frustrations clear after the 1-0 defeat to AFC Bournemouth on Thursday, leaving Ange Postecoglou needing a response in this London derby. Spurs wasted no time in providing exactly that, twice pressing high to punish their sloppy visitors and surge into a two-goal lead thanks to Cucurella's blunders. They should have added a third goal before the half-hour mark through either Destiny Udogie or Son, whose left-sided corner then saw Sarr flick a header against the crossbar. Another Son delivery could have made it 3-1 too, but Solanke diverted straight at Robert Sanchez with a tame effort just minutes after Sarr's opportunity. A plethora of issues remain in defence, however, as Cristian Romero – who limped off after just 15 minutes – and Micky van de Ven's returns did little to protect Spurs' struggling backline. Forster was regularly exposed to a barrage of Chelsea attempts, impressing with a few fine stops, but his resistance was ultimately broken by Bissouma's needless lunge after Sancho sent Caicedo bursting into the box. Spurs' defence was again all over the place when the in-form Fernandez fired Chelsea into the lead, before Sarr's inexplicable push from behind on Palmer capped a woeful collapse and left Postecoglou searching for answers ahead of their next league outing, which comes against struggling Southampton next Sunday. Benoit Badiashile set the tone for an unconvincing start, and while Kulusevski could not punish the centre-back's misplaced pass, Johnson did exactly that after Cucurella, who subsequently changed boots, slipped in the build-up to both Spurs goals. Palmer almost atoned for that glaring miss but his rasping drive was pushed away by Forster, who denied Pedro Neto's follow-up attempt, before the Spurs goalkeeper produced an impressive stretching stop to deny Sancho in the second half. But Chelsea eventually roared into the ascendancy thanks to the brilliance of ice-cold Palmer after the break, and Spurs’ defence could not cope once the Blues hit their stride. Club reports

Chelsea thumped nine-man Spurs 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last season but required an almighty fightback as Marc Cucurella's errors gifted the hosts an early 2-0 lead at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Palmer levelled just past the hour mark with his first penalty, and after Enzo Fernandez had blasted the Blues ahead, Palmer won another spot-kick, which he coolly dinked beyond Fraser Forster. Palmer now becomes the highest-scoring penalty taker in Premier League history with a 100 per cent conversation rate. Son Heung-min’s stoppage-time strike teed up a nervy ending for Chelsea, but they held firm to move two points clear of Arsenal in second and make ground on Liverpool, while Spurs sit 11th after a second defeat in the space of three days. Sancho halved the deficit when darting inside and drilling home via the help of the right-hand post, and the Chelsea comeback began. Yves Bissouma's challenge on Moises Caicedo saw Palmer level from 12 yards in the 61st minute, and Fernandez then hammered past the helpless Forster to put Chelsea ahead. The Spurs goalkeeper was left on the floor when Palmer – fouled by Sarr for the second spot-kick – chipped his 84th-minute penalty down the middle, as Son's late goal from James Maddison's cutback pass proved a mere consolation.

Chelsea carnage turns into celebration
Enzo Maresca's possession-based philosophy has been clear throughout the early parts of his Chelsea tenure and has proved successful – but an error-laden first half showed the risks to the strategy. Cucurella somewhat made amends as his simple pass teed up a sumptuous finish by Sancho, who then laid it on a plate for Palmer – only for Chelsea's talisman to fluff a gilt-edged chance to equalise – while Caicedo was perhaps fortunate to escape punishment when he lunged in on Sarr, though the VAR confirmed the referee’s call of no serious four play. Palmer almost atoned for that glaring miss but his rasping drive was pushed away by Forster, who denied Pedro Neto's follow-up attempt, before the Spurs goalkeeper produced an impressive stretching stop to deny Sancho in the second half. But Chelsea eventually roared into the ascendancy thanks to the brilliance of ice-cold Palmer after the break, and Spurs’ defence could not cope once the Blues hit their stride. Maresca, who will now want to see more steadfast defending from his team, continues to insist Chelsea are not in the title race, but this comeback leaves the Blues within touching distance of Liverpool ahead of hosting Brentford next Sunday.

Casemiro had cancelled out Crysencio Summerville’s opener as the game burst into life late on, but Bowen's penalty in the second minute of second-half stoppage time - awarded for Matthijs de Ligt's foul on substitute Danny Ings - settled the contest. However, there was late drama as Bowen won it in the second of 12 added minutes in the second half, scoring from the spot after De Ligt had fouled Ings. Bowen’s cool penalty finish handed Julen Lopetegui's hosts a much-needed victory as West Ham leapfrog their opponents into 13th spot with 11 points, the same tally as the 14th-placed Red Devils. United were denied by the woodwork again on 40 minutes when Christian Eriksen’s corner was glanced onto the bar by Hammers midfielder Edson Alvarez, but it was West Ham who made the breakthrough in the second half. Substitute Ings miscued his shot from a Bowen cross, but Summerville arrived at the far post to tap the loose ball home. Their lead only lasted seven minutes as Casemiro headed home from almost on the goal line, but there was to be one final twist with Bowen stepping up to fire the match-winning penalty past goalkeeper Andre Onana. After an uninspiring draw against Jose Mourinho’s Fenerbahce in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday, their latest defeat at the London Stadium will do little to quell the rising doubts. United were by far the better team in the first half but passed up several gilt-edged chances, and unlike against Brentford last time out, they did not sharpen up after Ten Hag's half-time team talk, dropping deeper and inviting West Ham to fire crosses into their area. Lopetegui gets a reprieve
While the problems continue to mount for Ten Hag and Man Utd, Lopetegui will feel some pressure lifting after a rare win at home, where West Ham had only previously triumphed once in four matches this season. But without the suspended Mohammed Kudus, West Ham offered little going forward in the early stages, with a wayward Lucas Paqueta header in the 28th minute their only chance of note in the opening period. Lopetegui will hope to see more of the same from his players at Nottingham Forest next week, as the Hammers look to build some momentum after a poor start. Club reports

Alejandro Garnacho had rattled the crossbar as early as the second minute, while Diogo Dalot somehow blazed over when presented with an open goal half an hour later. How the match unfolded
Man Utd almost made a dream start as Garnacho hit the woodwork with a curling effort early on, before Rasmus Hojlund forced a save from Lukasz Fabianski and an unmarked Bruno Fernandes headed over. But their biggest chance came after 32 minutes when Fernandes’ brilliant pass over the top found Dalot, who took the ball past Fabianski but fired over with the goal gaping. United were denied by the woodwork again on 40 minutes when Christian Eriksen’s corner was glanced onto the bar by Hammers midfielder Edson Alvarez, but it was West Ham who made the breakthrough in the second half. Their lead only lasted seven minutes as Casemiro headed home from almost on the goal line, but there was to be one final twist with Bowen stepping up to fire the match-winning penalty past goalkeeper Andre Onana. Pressure piled on Ten Hag
The spotlight was already firmly on Ten Hag ahead of Sunday's match, as United’s rocky start left fans wondering if their season was slipping away. United were by far the better team in the first half but passed up several gilt-edged chances, and unlike against Brentford last time out, they did not sharpen up after Ten Hag's half-time team talk, dropping deeper and inviting West Ham to fire crosses into their area. With Chelsea visiting Old Trafford next Sunday, things are not going to get any easier for Ten Hag and his players, with the noise surrounding United's boss only growing louder. Lopetegui gets a reprieve
While the problems continue to mount for Ten Hag and Man Utd, Lopetegui will feel some pressure lifting after a rare win at home, where West Ham had only previously triumphed once in four matches this season. Their display in the second half, however, was a much-improved one as they took the game to Man Utd, dusting themselves down even after the visitors levelled with little time left on the clock.

Fulham were forced to finish the game with 10 men due to Joachim Andersen sustaining an injury after they had used all their substitutes, and Goncalo Guedes came off the bench to add a fourth for Wolves. The victory lifts them outside the relegation zone on nine points, while Fulham drop two places to ninth, four adrift of the top four. How the match unfolded
It was Fulham who controlled the opening stages, but they failed to take a 16th-minute lead as Raul Jimenez stabbed Antonee Robinson's cross against the woodwork with the goal gaping. However, Wolves failed to heed that warning as Iwobi curled a wonderful strike home from 20 yards just three minutes later. Having struggled in attack early on, Wolves drew level via a moment of magic from Mario Lemina and Cunha after 31 minutes, as the former pitched a perfect chip into the Fulham box and Cunha superbly pulled it down to poke in the equaliser. Cunha then teed up Gomes for a driven, left-footed finish that put Wolves ahead in the 53rd minute, before Andersen's withdrawal left Fulham at a numerical disadvantage. Wolves have conceded more goals than any other Premier League side so far (28), yet some fine last-ditch defending from the likes of Rayan Ait-Nouri and Lemina – deployed as an emergency centre-back due to injuries to Craig Dawson and Santiago Bueno – kept Fulham at bay with the scores level. Iwobi keeps Silva smiling despite defeat
Marco Silva demands plenty from his Fulham stars with the Portuguese coach a stickler for standards and consistency in performances. Players who meet those levels are rewarded with a constant role in the team and Iwobi has been a shining example this term. The Nigeria international is one of six Fulham players to start all 12 Premier League games in 2024/25, with Silva now confident in his ability to produce a rounded performance on a constant basis. His early goal was one of the best he has scored as a Fulham player, picking out the top-left corner after working half a yard on the edge of the area. Iwobi also netted the winner against Leicester City in August, sealed a draw at Everton last month, and despite today's strike not yielding any points for Fulham, he will continue to be crucial to Silva's plans going forward. Fulham have a tough run coming up, however, with Tottenham, Brighton, Arsenal and Liverpool their next four Premier League opponents. Club reports

O'Neil is under no illusions regarding the size of the task facing his Wolves side, with a 2-0 victory over Southampton – coming after back-to-back draws with Brighton and Crystal Palace – only doing so much to quieten speculation about his future. Wolves have conceded more goals than any other Premier League side so far (28), yet some fine last-ditch defending from the likes of Rayan Ait-Nouri and Lemina – deployed as an emergency centre-back due to injuries to Craig Dawson and Santiago Bueno – kept Fulham at bay with the scores level. With 20 goals scored at the other end, meanwhile, Wolves have found the net more times than any other side in the bottom nine. Cunha has contributed to half of those strikes with seven goals and three assists, and the Brazilian produced yet another Man-of-the-Match display in this comeback win in West London. If Wolves are to pull clear of the danger zone in the coming months, Cunha is the man most likely to lead their charge. Club reports

With Nuno Espirito Santo suspended from touchline duties due to his ""unacceptable behaviour"" against Brighton & Hove Albion, Forest showed no signs of missing their boss. Elliot Anderson set the tone with a mazy run that culminated in forcing a smart stop from Henderson before the Forest midfielder produced a delightful delivery for Wood, who should have finished with a flicked header. At the other end, Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic did just enough to keep the bright Nketiah quiet, while Sels was in inspired form to help Forest record their first home win of the season. That solid defence, coupled with an improvement in finishing, will have Nuno optimistic about building on their eighth-place position when they visit rivals Leicester City on Friday under the King Power Stadium lights. Profligate Palace punished
Despite their early-season struggles, Palace did not appear a side devoid of confidence or short of attacking ambition at the City Ground, though finishing issues remain aplenty for the Eagles. Club reports

67,67,crystal-palace,2024-10-21,"Chris Wood netted his fifth goal of the season as Nottingham Forest sealed their first home victory since April against winless Crystal Palace on Monday night. Oliver Glasner's Palace produced an encouraging performance, but it ultimately ended in defeat - their eighth league match without a victory. The Forest talisman atoned for his first-half struggles after 65 minutes, however, when Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson failed to keep out a tame effort from the edge of the area. The narrow victory lifted battling Forest - who were helped by Matz Sels’ heroics in goal - to eighth in the table, while Palace sit 18th, a point adrift of Ipswich Town. How the match unfolded
Eberechi Eze steered narrowly wide of the top-left corner just five minutes in, while Wood saw a header cleared off the line by Jefferson Lerma before nodding another glorious chance over. Sels produced an eye-catching stop after the interval, tipping Eze's ferocious 30-yard drive away from the top-right corner via the help of the crossbar to keep his side level. The ball squirmed under the outstretched right hand of the Palace 'keeper, who put his face to the turf in frustration. A moment of fortune proved pivotal, though, as Wood finally breached the Palace defence when his hopeful right-footed drive slipped under Henderson, who did well shortly after to kick away from Anderson. Profligate Palace punished
Despite their early-season struggles, Palace did not appear a side devoid of confidence or short of attacking ambition at the City Ground, though finishing issues remain aplenty for the Eagles. Nketiah got the nod ahead of Jean-Philippe Mateta and looked good value for his selection, twice forcing routine saves from Sels in between testing the frame of the goal with an ambitious right-footed drive. Daichi Kamada rushed another presentable opportunity after being found unmarked from Daniel Munoz's right-wing cross as profligate Palace struggled to make their openings count. Sels was once again on hand to thwart Eze's volley after the break, and the follow-up attempt from Kamada, whose inexplicable close-range miss was spared by a belated offside flag. Eze saw another long-range effort deflected over as Palace upped the intensity just past the hour, though Henderson's shortfalls at the other end ultimately undid any signs of promise from the visitors. Having failed to find the net in half of their eight league matches so far, Glasner desperately needs improvements heading into Sunday's London derby at home to Tottenham Hotspur. Club reports

68,68,arsenal,2024-10-05,"Kai Havertz scored again and Bukayo Saka starred as Arsenal came from a goal down to overcome a Southampton 3-1 at Emirates Stadium. But the Gunners responded three minutes later through Havertz, who continued his scoring streak at Emirates Stadium with a fierce strike beyond his former team-mate Aaron Ramsdale. The comeback was complete 10 minutes later when Saka’s teasing delivery to the back-post found substitute Gabriel Martinelli, who scored from a narrow angle. Saka himself then sealed the triumph with a fine first-time finish, with Arsenal remaining third, behind league leaders Liverpool and Manchester City, while Southampton sit 19th. How the match unfolded
A lightning start from Arsenal threatened to blow the visitors away early on, but Gabriel Jesus and Havertz were unable to trouble the returning Ramsdale. Despite the Arsenal onslaught, Southampton registered the first attempt on target, though Kyle Walker-Peters’ speculative effort was no test for David Raya. Arsenal claimed Raheem Sterling had been fouled by Fernandes in the build-up, but referee Tony Harrington waved away the appeals and the midfielder set up Archer to cut inside and beat David Raya via a slight deflection. But Southampton’s joy was short-lived after Flynn Downes’ errant pass was punished by Havertz, who netted his seventh consecutive goal in as many matches on home soil. Ten minutes later substitute Martinelli’s finished from close range, a goal which was confirmed by VAR after a check for offside, to put Arsenal ahead. Southampton threatened again, with Taylor Harwood-Bellis rattling the crossbar from a corner, but a heavy touch at the other end from Yukinari Sugawara’s fell kindly into the path of Saka, who sent a right-footed effort into the far corner to wrap up the points and secure a 400th home win for Arsenal in the Premier League. Arsenal survive Saints scare
Having been run close by Leicester City last weekend, Arsenal almost failed to learn their lesson against another promoted team this time around. A dominant opening to proceedings saw referee Harrington wave away two penalty appeals, with Sterling going down under the challenge of Jan Bednarek, before Havertz was then hauled down in the box by Walker-Peters, much to the frustration of the home supporters. But for all of Arsenal’s possession, they created very few chances, often forced to take on efforts from distance that were repelled by Southampton’s stern rearguard. Archer’s shock opener seemingly spurred Arsenal into life, with their devastating front line finally finding their free-flowing best when Havertz tucked away the leveller, and a triple change from Mikel Arteta on the hour-mark showed his desire to get the game won. The introduction of Martinelli, debutant Mikel Merino and Leandro Trossard saw the Gunners take control, with the latter continuing his bright start to the season with a well-taken effort. Saka completed the victory, though Arteta will still see room for improvement from his side. A criticism of Martin’s side this season has been their risky, possession-based approach, and that proved their downfall when Downes’ sloppy pass was picked off by Saka, who then fed Havertz for Arsenal’s equaliser.

Russell Martin called for calm ahead of kick-off, with his side only in the early stages of their Premier League return, and there was certainly much improvement compared with Monday’s horror show at AFC Bournemouth. Southampton were able to navigate a nervy opening period to maintain their hopes of earning a scalp against a title contender, and Archer’s goal was the least the visitors deserved for sticking valiantly at their task, though their good work was undone shortly after. A criticism of Martin’s side this season has been their risky, possession-based approach, and that proved their downfall when Downes’ sloppy pass was picked off by Saka, who then fed Havertz for Arsenal’s equaliser. Martin can take confidence from the showing in north London, but Southampton have now gone 20 Premier League matches without a victory. Club reports

70,70,wolverhampton,2024-09-15,"Two goals in five second-half minutes from Fabian Schar and Harvey Barnes saw Newcastle United come from behind to stun Wolverhampton Wanderers with a 2-1 win at Molineux on Sunday. Mario Lemina had given the hosts the lead by rounding off a free-flowing counterattack late in the first half, sweeping home following a clever dummy from Joao Gomes. The result keeps Wolves in the bottom three with just a single point, while Newcastle move up to third with 10, ahead of their meeting with Fulham next week. But Wolves grew in confidence as the first half went on and took the lead nine minutes before the break. Jorgen Strand Larsen’s cross was cleverly dummied by Gomes, allowing captain Lemina to tap home from close range. Lemina could then have doubled his tally after being picked out by the industrious Andre, but he failed to test Nick Pope in the Newcastle net as he scuffed his left-footed effort wide. Wolves continued to threaten on the break in the second half, with Larsen's effort striking the base of the post, but two bolts from the blue took the game away from them late on. A huge deflection off the head of Craig Dawson carried Schar's 25-yard effort out of Johnstone's reach and into the top-left corner, then Barnes cut inside from the left to beat the Wolves goalkeeper with a rasping strike from range. Only a stunning save from Pope kept Matheus Cunha's stoppage-time volley out, but Newcastle clung on, almost adding a third when Barnes sent a dinked effort wide at the death. Brazilian duo impress in defeat
Wolves’ return from the international break ended in heartbreaking fashion as one moment of misfortune and one piece of individual brilliance made the difference. But there were positives for Gary O'Neil to take despite the result. After a slow start, the hosts recovered well, with the robust yet skilful midfield duo of Gomes and Andre causing Newcastle plenty of headaches. Gomes, meanwhile, showed remarkable awareness to dummy Larsen's cross for Lemina to sweep home the opener, having started the attack with an interception near his own area. Wolves showed plenty of promise in the final third but failed to extend their advantage on several occasions, with Larsen and Cunha going close early in the second half.

Newcastle had earlier struck the post through Anthony Gordon but Eddie Howe's men struggled to carve out clear-cut chances before a series of half-time changes prompted an improvement. The result keeps Wolves in the bottom three with just a single point, while Newcastle move up to third with 10, ahead of their meeting with Fulham next week. How the match unfolded
An encounter devoid of early chances burst into life in the 22nd minute when Gordon skipped beyond Nelson Semedo and Yerson Mosquera, only to see his curling effort bounce off the far post. Lemina could then have doubled his tally after being picked out by the industrious Andre, but he failed to test Nick Pope in the Newcastle net as he scuffed his left-footed effort wide. Only a stunning save from Pope kept Matheus Cunha's stoppage-time volley out, but Newcastle clung on, almost adding a third when Barnes sent a dinked effort wide at the death.

Newcastle started the encounter on the front foot, with Alexander Isak sending Jacob Murphy on his way, only for his chipped effort to be tipped over the crossbar by Johnstone. Yet it was Wolves who dictated proceedings for most of the first half, forcing Howe into making alterations at the interval, introducing Sandro Tonali, Joe Willock and Barnes in place of Isak, Joelinton and Sean Longstaff. Barnes’ directness offered the Magpies an outlet on the break, and when the game became stretched at 1-1, it was his stunning strike that clinched the win.

72,72,ipswich-town,2024-08-31,"Ipswich Town earned their first point of the Premier League season but were denied victory by Adama Traore's leveller in a 1-1 draw with Fulham at Portman Road. The Tractor Boys’ search for a first top-flight victory since April 2002 started in stunning fashion as Liam Delap rifled the ball home after good work from Leif Davis. With neither team able to find a winner, Ipswich sit 16th in the early-season standings, while Fulham are just inside the top half of the table ahead of the weekend's remaining fixtures. How the match unfolded
The visitors' attempts to take control of proceedings were halted by a bolt from Ipswich blue as Delap’s driving run from deep ended with a finish into the top corner, aided by the fingertips of Bernd Leno. But the Tractor Boys’ joy was short-lived as Antonee Robinson’s teasing delivery was turned home by Traore, with Rodrigo Muniz’s header almost giving them the lead a minute later. Ipswich's new signing Ogbene almost marked his debut with a goal, seeing his header saved by Leno as Sam Szmodics could only fire the rebound high into the stands. Ogbene was again denied by Leno as he raced through on goal, while Jimenez failed to make the visitors’ best second-half chance count as his shot stung the palms of Arijanet Muric, before Omari Hutchinson went close for Ipswich in stoppage time. Championship stars continue Premier League adjustment 
Of those that started the encounter for Ipswich, eight played their football in the Championship last term, with three more introduced from the bench. Kieran McKenna needs his additions from the second tier to adapt quickly if they are to extend their top-flight stay beyond one season. Jacob Greaves, Szmodics and substitute Jack Clarke have come in to give the Tractor Boys exciting options, showing early on this term that they are suited to the step up. Hutchinson and Davis also impressed for the hosts, with the former going close to stroking the ball home for a memorable three points at the death, but it wasn’t meant to be. The result marks a milestone for McKenna as he claims a first point in the top-flight, and he will be closely marking fixtures at Portman Road on his calendar, having already provided stern tests for both Liverpool and Fulham. Nervy Fulham fail to overcome slow start 
After impressing in their opening two Premier League fixtures, Fulham failed to lay a glove on their opponents in front of a raucous Portman Road in the opening exchanges. Delap’s moment of individual brilliance was the least Ipswich deserved for their electric start, and Traore's equaliser failed to click the visitors into gear. A tepid second-half display saw only two of Fulham’s four attempts trouble Muric in the Ipswich goal, though Jimenez's late introduction gave them a focal point in attack after Muniz failed to make the desired impact up front.

City had to wait until the 84th minute to break the deadlock on their final trip to Goodison Park, where Nico O’Reilly put them in front with a close-range finish after Everton’s defence had largely frustrated Pep Guardiola’s side. Everton had earlier hit a post through James Tarkowski, who subsequently went off injured, while Jarrad Branthwaite saw a close-range header saved by Stefan Ortega. City move into fourth place, a point behind Newcastle United in third, while Everton remain 13th, having lost a Premier League game at home for the first time since January. Matheus Nunes hit a low drive on target, though it was dealt with by Jordan Pickford, before Tarkowski’s glancing header from James Garner’s corner struck the right-hand post. That Everton opportunity sparked City into life – Kevin De Bruyne’s curling left-footed attempt seemed destined for the bottom-left corner until Jake O’Brien stooped low to head it wide. Ortega reacted well to keep out Branthwaite’s looping header after the restart, while Abdoulaye Doucoure saw an effort bravely blocked by Josko Gvardiol, though an apparent hamstring injury to defensive stalwart Tarkowski knocked Everton’s rhythm. An error from replacement Michael Keane gifted Omar Marmoush a chance the Egyptian failed to take, but O’Reilly made no mistake when he got in front of the Everton centre-back moments later to tap in from Nunes’ centre. City’s captain was their most dangerous player, though, fluid in his movement and sharp in his passing,
But despite controlling the possession, as they do so well, City struggled to puncture a resolute Everton backline, and they had to rely on first the woodwork, and then Ortega, to keep the scores level. Toffees come unstuck at Goodison
There are now just two games left for Everton at Goodison Park, with strugglers Ipswich Town and Southampton visiting in May. David Moyes’ team gave a good account of themselves, but he will have probably been disappointed they did not offer more of an attacking threat, despite showing some positive signs with those big chances for Tarkowski and Branthwaite. Doucoure was Everton’s hero last time out, snatching three vital points with a stoppage-time winner in an evenly-matched contest against Nottingham Forest, but he could not make a telling impact, while Iliman Ndiaye cut a frustrated figure out on the left, and Jack Harrison flitted in and out of things, although he did get close to a perfectly-weighted cross from Vitalii Mykolenko at one point. Moyes may well point to that injury to Tarkowski as the turning point. An ever-present since he joined Everton from Burnley, the centre-back left a void in defence when he trudged off, and Keane was at least partially at fault for City’s opener. Everton round off April with a trip to London to face Chelsea, before they are back at home for that visit of Ipswich – Moyes will not want Goodison Park to witness another Toffees defeat.

De Bruyne began the game in his typical attacking midfield role, but moved with freedom throughout, even playing as a false nine in certain passages across the first half, with Marmoush drifting to the left to double up with Savinho. City’s captain was their most dangerous player, though, fluid in his movement and sharp in his passing,
But despite controlling the possession, as they do so well, City struggled to puncture a resolute Everton backline, and they had to rely on first the woodwork, and then Ortega, to keep the scores level. The midfield trio of Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva and Nico Gonzalez looked slightly off the pace, leaving De Bruyne isolated and overburdened in central midfield. It was youngster O’Reilly – one of the bright sparks from their frustrating season – that was ultimately in the right place at the right time to nudge City ahead. Next up for City is a home encounter with Aston Villa, in a huge meeting in the race for Champions League spots. An ever-present since he joined Everton from Burnley, the centre-back left a void in defence when he trudged off, and Keane was at least partially at fault for City’s opener. Match reports

After recording their lowest-ever Premier League finish last season, United looked set to be frustrated at Old Trafford on Friday until their new striker diverted a deft finish past Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno in the 87th minute. Introduced midway through the second half by Erik ten Hag, Zirkzee applied the crucial touch to fellow substitute Alejandro Garnacho’s teasing centre to settle the contest. Bruno Fernandes had earlier squandered United’s best chances, with Leno in excellent form for the visitors. But Zirkzee’s effort ensured United got the ball rolling as they begin their season with a perfect result. How the match unfolded
With United debutant Noussair Mazraoui having made a vital intervention to prevent Alex Iwobi getting onto Adama Traore’s cutback, the hosts wanted a penalty when Amad Diallo took a tumble under pressure from Antonee Robinson, but there was nothing doing for referee Robert Jones, whose decision was confirmed by VAR. Kenny Tete tested Andre Onana at the other end, before Fernandes – playing up front – twice had the chance to take centre stage. Former United midfielder Andreas Pereira should have made Leno’s work count when he had Iwobi in support and the home defence outnumbered on a counter, only for the Brazil international to pick out Harry Maguire. Garnacho’s low cross had just enough pace on it to find Zirkzee, who stuck out a leg to divert his finish into the bottom-left corner. After a mistake from Calvin Bassey, United should have made sure of the result in the final minute of stoppage time, only for Garnacho to flap wildly after latching onto Marcus Rashford’s square ball, though that miss ultimately mattered little. Zirkzee makes his mark 
In the first match of United’s 100th top-flight season, one of the club’s newest editions – wearing the Red Devils’ iconic No 11 shirt – proved decisive. With Zirkzee, signed from Serie A side Bologna in July, having missed much of pre-season following his exploits with the Netherlands at UEFA EURO 2024 and not featuring in last week’s FA Community Shield, Ten Hag opted to push Fernandes into an unfamiliar striker role. Opportunities did fall Fernandes’ way, but the lack of composure he showed in those first-half chances – which were both teed up by Casemiro – belied a player featuring out of position. With Rasmus Hojlund out injured, there is no reason why Zirkzee cannot stake his claim to lead United’s line. While Fernandes should have done better in those one-v-ones, Leno made himself big and reacted sharply to charge off his line, as he did to thwart Mount early in the second half. Club reports

Leno’s hard work undone, but Fulham can look up 
Had Fulham held on for a point – or maybe even more – then it would have been in no small part down to the excellent Leno, who once again proved just how good of a shot-stopper he is. While Fernandes should have done better in those one-v-ones, Leno made himself big and reacted sharply to charge off his line, as he did to thwart Mount early in the second half. Marco Silva may be frustrated with his attackers, though. Fulham created openings, with Traore particularly impactful down the right flank, yet the Cottagers could just not apply the finishing touch, or find the final pass, when it mattered most. With new England interim manager Lee Carsley watching on from the stands, Emile Smith Rowe had a rather quiet debut, though if Leno shows the same level of form throughout the campaign, there is no reason for the Cottagers not to have high hopes for this season, as long as that composure and guile does arrive in the final third. Fulham will be eyeing their first points when they host promoted Leicester City next week. Club reports

The Hammers went close early as Niclas Fullkrug made a run to the front post to apply a finish to Lucas Paqueta’s cross, but Aaron Ramsdale was able to keep it out from close range. West Ham took the lead two minutes into the second half as a quick counter-attack led to Bowen curling a fine effort past the despairing Ramsdale and into the far corner. West Ham thought they had done enough for the win but were to be denied by a moment of brilliance from Ugochukwu, netting his first Premier League goal. Hammers labour under Potter
Graham Potter has not had the best of starts at West Ham, with the club in 17th place at the start of the day’s play, behind a Wolves side that have fought relegation for most of the season. There was more possession on display at London Stadium, but a lack of incisiveness in offensive positions failed to liven up a home crowd that has been largely devoid of any excitement this season, after a thoroughly disappointing campaign. Fullkrug made a return to the side and did offer himself as something of a focal point, going close early on and then turning provider for Bowen’s goal on the break early in the second half. West Ham travel to Potter's former club Brighton & Hove Albion next Saturday. Sulemana was a livewire, drifting in from the left and penetrating the West Ham backline with his runs in behind, while Paul Onuachu held the ball up well as a target man. Match reports

Southampton caused more problems as the half wore on, with a fine attacking move leading to Kyle Walker-Peters sliding an effort inches wide of the far post. They went even closer minutes later as Kamaldeen Sulemana struck an effort against the crossbar from inside the penalty area. Southampton created a brilliant chance on 80 minutes as a knockdown from a free-kick found Dibling in space inside the area, but he blazed his shot over with the goal at his mercy. They struggled with some of the attacking patterns from the already-relegated Saints, primarily in the first half, and they were lucky not to fall behind as they headed off at half-time to a chorus of boos.

82,82,aston-villa,2025-04-19,"Aston Villa claimed a huge win in the race for UEFA Champions League qualification with a 4-1 thrashing of Newcastle United, pulling within two points of their opponents. Ian Maatsen and Amadou Onana struck either side of a Dan Burn own goal in the second half at Villa Park, where Unai Emery's team thoroughly deserved their victory. Ollie Watkins had scored Villa's opener in the first minute and could have had a perfect hat-trick before half-time, but he twice rattled the woodwork, with those chances coming either side of Fabian Schar’s equaliser. Villa always carried the greater threat, though, and they pulled clear after Maatsen scored his first Premier League goal, climbing to sixth in the Premier League on 57 points. How the match unfolded
Just 33 seconds were on the clock when Villa went ahead, with Watkins' strike deflecting off Schar to wrong-foot Nick Pope after the hosts pressed high to recover possession. Watkins almost had another in the fifth minute, but his effort cannoned back off the crossbar and Newcastle hit back in the 18th minute, Schar ghosting in to nod Harvey Barnes' cross home. Marco Asensio scuffed his shot when presented with an immediate chance to restore Villa's lead, then Watkins again hit the woodwork, his bullet header bouncing off the left post. Not deterred by those near-misses, Villa picked up where they left off in the second half and retook the lead when Watkins played in Maatsen for a powerful finish across goal in the 64th minute. Villa had the third goal their pressure warranted nine minutes later, with Jacob Ramsey's low cross being deflected in by the unfortunate Burn. Watkins back with a bang
The loan signing of Marcus Rashford has led to a reduction in playing time for Watkins, who declared after a 3-0 win at Southampton last week that he was not happy with playing a supporting role. Watkins started on the bench in both legs of Villa's Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, but was restored to the line-up here and produced a talismanic performance. His early strike drew him level with Gabriel Agbonlahor as Villa's joint-leading Premier League scorer, with 74 goals in the competition. Rogers' strong hold-up play and Asensio's slick ball out to the left had Watkins running at the Newcastle backline, and he timed his pass to perfection to tee up Maatsen. Watkins has now both scored and assisted in eight separate Premier League matches since the start of last season, and with the England international at the top of his game and plenty of other options available, Villa will feel momentum is on their side in the European race as they look for an immediate return to the Champions League, after their midweek exit. Reality check for Newcastle
Newcastle have enjoyed facing Villa lately, winning three straight games against them by scorelines of 5-1, 3-1 and 3-0 coming into this one. But perhaps the effort required in Wednesday's 5-0 rout of Crystal Palace told here, as they simply failed to deal with Villa's dynamism. The visiting defence was nowhere to be seen when Watkins took Youri Tielemans' pass under his spell on the left side of the area early on, and Schar's weak attempt to block only sent the ball spinning in at the near post. And while Schar redeemed himself to equalise with the aid of a magnificent cross from in-form winger Barnes, Newcastle buckled in the face of relentless Villa pressure after the break. Villa's substitutes Onana, Rashford, Ramsey, Donyell Malen and Ross Barkley injected more running power and the game was up at 4-1, with Tindall replacing Alexander Isak and Barnes to rest them for upcoming assignments.

Andoni Iraola's second season in charge of the Cherries looked set to begin with a defeat when Chris Wood pounced from close range to give Forest a first-half lead. Forest's frustrations were compounded by a potentially serious injury suffered by Danilo, who received lengthy treatment before being carried off on a stretcher early in the first half. Danilo's replacement Ryan Yates played a key role as Forest made the breakthrough after 23 minutes. Anthony Elanga went close moments later with a curling shot from outside the box, which Neto had to keep out with a smart save, then Bournemouth thought they had levelled when Dango Ouattara smashed an effort into the roof of the net. The second half began with Forest still on top, and they nearly doubled their advantage from a corner, only for Neto to make a solid stop to keep out Willy Boly’s header. Having toiled in attack for much of the contest, Bournemouth equalised with four minutes of the 90 remaining, as Toffolo's clearance struck Murillo and bounced straight to Semenyo, who finished from six yards out. Bournemouth nearly nicked it against the run of play at the death, but Murillo was on hand to deny substitute Daniel Jebbison with a vital clearance to preserve Forest's point. Encouraging signs for Forest
Despite the sucker punch they suffered near the end of the match, Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo will surely be encouraged by his side’s performance. The Forest eleven which started the encounter was a familiar one and this looked to be to their advantage, with the hosts showing real fluency when holding possession, while also looking equally committed when applying the press to Bournemouth. They created the better chances in the match, with Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi both going close with low, thundering efforts which had to be kept out by Neto.

They created the better chances in the match, with Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi both going close with low, thundering efforts which had to be kept out by Neto. Life after Solanke for the Cherries
Following the loss of Solanke, Bournemouth could take encouragement from Semenyo stepping up as a replacement. He was a constant threat for the Cherries and was rewarded with a late goal to earn a point for his side. Their frontline should soon be bolstered by the signing of Evanilson from Porto and Cherries fans will hope he can link up well with the likes of Semenyo and Luis Sinisterra, who endured one of his quieter outings on Saturday. Bournemouth will now look forward to their first home game of the season against Newcastle in eight days' time. ""
Andoni Iraola: ""I am probably pleased because you score at the end and you feel like you recovered one point. ""

86,86,everton,2024-08-31,"AFC Bournemouth produced an astonishing late turnaround from 2-0 down to snatch a dramatic 3-2 victory over Everton at Goodison Park. Michael Keane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin were on target early in the second half to put the hosts in control. Sean Dyche’s side made a bright start and carried the greater attacking threat early on. Idrissa Gueye fired over from just inside the box, while Jack Harrison dragged an effort wide of the target. The hosts broke through five minutes after the restart when Calvert-Lewin cushioned Harrison’s cross into the path of Keane, who drilled home superbly from 12 yards out. Everton doubled their lead soon after as Calvert-Lewin rounded off another neat exchange of passes by latching onto Dwight McNeil’s through ball, and calmly lifting over Kepa. Everton went close to increasing their lead, but Bournemouth pulled a goal back three minutes from time when Semenyo turned in Dango Ouattara’s deep cross. Another deep centre – this time from Sinisterra – was met by the head of Cook in the 92nd minute, while Jordan Pickford denied Marcus Tavernier and Semenyo soon after. The Cherries’ first win of the season lifts them to seventh place, while pointless Everton remain rooted to the foot of the table. Toffees’ August blues continue
Not since beating Brighton & Hove Albion in 2021 had Everton tasted a Premier League victory in the month of August, now stretching back 11 matches. After conceding seven goals without reply in their opening two matches, the Toffees enjoyed a reprieve with the comfortable Carabao Cup win over Doncaster Rovers in midweek. Sean Dyche’s side appeared to have carried that momentum into today’s game, and the Goodison Park faithful certainly responded to them. Indeed, Keane opened the scoring on his 200th Everton start, while Calvert-Lewin marked his 250th appearance by doubling the lead. The hosts almost added further gloss to the 2-0 scoreline when Ndiaye drew a fine save from Kepa, while James Tarkowski headed against the outside of the post. Comeback kings Bournemouth complete sensational turnaround
Bournemouth had lost on six of their seven previous Premier League visits to Goodison Park. But as the nerves grew among the Goodison Park faithful, Bournemouth grew stronger. They had already gone within inches of completing the turnaround with Pickford denying them on two occasions, but their persistence eventually paid off as they sealed a remarkable comeback victory.

87,87,bournemouth,2024-08-31,"AFC Bournemouth produced an astonishing late turnaround from 2-0 down to snatch a dramatic 3-2 victory over Everton at Goodison Park. However, they were pegged back late on as Antoine Semenyo halved the deficit on 87 minutes, before Lewis Cook levelled in the second minute of stoppage time. There was to be another remarkable twist with Luis Sinisterra’s last-gasp header securing all three points for Andoni Iraola’s side. Bournemouth had debutant Kepa Arrizabalaga to thank in the 33rd minute when the goalkeeper – who joined on loan from Chelsea on deadline day – managed to block Iliman Ndiaye’s close-range volley with his legs. Everton went close to increasing their lead, but Bournemouth pulled a goal back three minutes from time when Semenyo turned in Dango Ouattara’s deep cross. Another deep centre – this time from Sinisterra – was met by the head of Cook in the 92nd minute, while Jordan Pickford denied Marcus Tavernier and Semenyo soon after. However, the England goalkeeper was helpless in the sixth minute of stoppage time, when an unmarked Sinisterra nodded in Justin Kluivert’s cross to snatch the most dramatic victory. The Cherries’ first win of the season lifts them to seventh place, while pointless Everton remain rooted to the foot of the table. Once Bournemouth gave themselves hope and momentum, there seemed to be every chance they could turn it around, and so it proved. Comeback kings Bournemouth complete sensational turnaround
Bournemouth had lost on six of their seven previous Premier League visits to Goodison Park. The Cherries were fortunate to only be trailing by two goals by the time they pulled one back in the 87th minute. Iraola’s side, who opened the season with successive draws against Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United, would certainly have taken another stalemate at that point. But as the nerves grew among the Goodison Park faithful, Bournemouth grew stronger. Fittingly, the Cherries ended their own Premier League struggles in the month of August, with a first such victory in 10 attempts since beating Aston Villa on the opening weekend of the 2022-23 season.

88,88,arsenal,2024-08-31,"A red card for Declan Rice proved key as Arsenal dropped their first points of the Premier League season in a 1-1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion at the Emirates Stadium. When Bukayo Saka teed up team-mate Kai Havertz for his second goal of the season in the first half, it looked like Arsenal were well on their way towards a third consecutive victory to start the campaign, with new signings Raheem Sterling and Mikel Merino watching on from the stands. But after Rice was sent off for two bookable offences early in the second half, the Seagulls – who themselves came into the match with a 100 per cent record – secured a point in the 58th minute when Joao Pedro slotted in from close range. Arsenal and Brighton each have seven points from a possible nine. How the match unfolded
Mikel Arteta’s side quickly settled and established control of proceedings, with Saka and Martin Odegaard volleying the hosts’ best opportunities straight at Bart Verbruggen in the Brighton goal. Although the visitors grew into the contest with Kaoru Mitoma firing narrowly wide, they fell behind in the 38th minute as Saka outmuscled Lewis Dunk before feeding Havertz, who lifted the ball over the outrushing Verbruggen and into the net. However, the Gunners were reduced to 10 men within three minutes of the start of the second half, as Rice received a second yellow card after he was deemed to have prevented Joel Veltman from taking a quick free-kick. Verbruggen denied both Havertz and Saka, but it was Brighton who asserted more control as full-time grew closer. Gunners' winning streak ends
As well as looking to make it three wins from their opening three games this season, Arsenal were also seeking to extend their Premier League winning streak to nine matches, having finished 2023/24 in flying form. They looked on track to do just that following a positive start to the match and Havertz’s breakthrough shortly before half-time. The Germany international was set up by Saka’s clever ball and has now found the net in each of his last four appearances against Brighton. Saka, meanwhile, is the first Arsenal player since a certain Thierry Henry to provide an assist in each of their first three games of a Premier League season. However, after the first dismissal of Rice’s 245-match top-flight career, it looked likely that Arsenal would drop points for only the third time in 2024. Indeed, after Joao Pedro’s prompt equaliser, Arteta would probably have taken a point. It looked like it could be another torrid trip in the early stages as Arsenal dominated possession before Brighton lost James Milner to injury in the 17th minute in a significant blow. However, after that stoppage Brighton did seem to settle into a rhythm that was only briefly interrupted by Havertz’s opener. Despite falling behind, Hurzeler’s side did not let their heads drop and would dominate possession for large periods at the Emirates. Club reports

Although the visitors grew into the contest with Kaoru Mitoma firing narrowly wide, they fell behind in the 38th minute as Saka outmuscled Lewis Dunk before feeding Havertz, who lifted the ball over the outrushing Verbruggen and into the net. Brighton took swift advantage of the extra man by equalising. Yankuba Minteh raced onto Dunk’s precise through ball and, after David Raya parried the shot, Joao Pedro – who had netted a late winner against Manchester United last week – was there to tuck away the rebound. Verbruggen denied both Havertz and Saka, but it was Brighton who asserted more control as full-time grew closer. The Germany international was set up by Saka’s clever ball and has now found the net in each of his last four appearances against Brighton.

London has not been a happy hunting ground for Brighton in recent times. The Seagulls failed to win on any of their seven Premier League visits to the capital last season. It looked like it could be another torrid trip in the early stages as Arsenal dominated possession before Brighton lost James Milner to injury in the 17th minute in a significant blow. However, after that stoppage Brighton did seem to settle into a rhythm that was only briefly interrupted by Havertz’s opener. The visitors deservedly grabbed their equaliser through Joao Pedro and, given the positive display they produced, they would be justified in counting themselves unfortunate not to be leaving with all three points. With a home fixture against Ipswich Town to come after the international break, Brighton will be feeling good and confident of extending their impressive start. Club reports

90,90,newcastle-united,2025-04-16,"Newcastle United climbed to third in the Premier League and took control of the race for UEFA Champions League qualification with a 5-0 win over Crystal Palace. In a game that was rescheduled due to their successful trip to the EFL Cup final last month, Newcastle were out of sight by half-time at a jubilant St James' Park. A stunning strike from Jacob Murphy got the Magpies up and running, then they ran riot after Nick Pope saved an Eberechi Eze penalty. Harvey Barnes and Fabian Schar netted either side of Marc Guehi's own goal to put the hosts 4-0 up at the break, then Alexander Isak's curler rounded off the scoring in the 58th minute. Newcastle – who again had Jason Tindall in the dugout as Eddie Howe continues to recover from pneumonia – are now two points clear of fourth-placed Nottingham Forest, while Palace stay 12th. How the match unfolded
Isak had already gone close twice before Murphy put Newcastle ahead, firing a spectacular shot inside Dean Henderson's near-post from a tight angle on the right. But Eze rolled a tame effort straight at Pope, and Newcastle had their second goal two minutes later, Guehi deflecting Barnes' cutback into his own net. Two more Newcastle goals followed in first-half stoppage time, with Barnes firing across goal to cap a devastating counter-attack and Schar glancing Murphy's deep free-kick home. Isak fired straight at Henderson from a great position early in the second half, but he got in on the act soon afterwards, curling home from distance after Maxence Lacroix lost possession. Newcastle hit stride at perfect time
Since exiting the FA Cup to Brighton & Hove Albion in early March, Newcastle have won six straight games in all competitions, the last three in dominant fashion. After routing Leicester City 3-0 and Manchester United 4-1, the Magpies stepped things up a notch in their game in hand. Before Murphy scored one of the goals of the season, rattling a shot past Henderson from near the byline, Isak had already had two decent opportunities – he worked Henderson from 18 yards in the seventh minute then nodded just over two minutes later. Newcastle's third goal was a thing of beauty as Sandro Tonali fed Barnes on the break, and the in-form winger beat Lacroix with a cheeky stepover before firing across goal and in. Isak was determined to join them on the scoresheet and would not be denied in the second half, curling in from distance for his 21st Premier League goal of the season. With a wealth of attacking talent available and momentum firmly behind them, Newcastle are in control of their destiny, ahead of Saturday's clash with fellow Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa. Newcastle sealed UEFA Europa Conference League qualification via their EFL Cup triumph, but if the Magpies qualify for the Champions League or UEFA Europa League via their Premier League finish, that spot will be passed down. Fewer than 120 seconds later, Guehi – who was reportedly of interest to Newcastle last summer – scored an own goal when facing the Magpies for the second time this campaign. Club reports

Newcastle – who again had Jason Tindall in the dugout as Eddie Howe continues to recover from pneumonia – are now two points clear of fourth-placed Nottingham Forest, while Palace stay 12th. Palace had a golden chance to level in the 36th minute as Pope clattered Chris Richards while coming out to punch, with Darren England awarding the penalty after a VAR review. But Eze rolled a tame effort straight at Pope, and Newcastle had their second goal two minutes later, Guehi deflecting Barnes' cutback into his own net. Palace's best chance for a consolation saw Daniel Munoz's header blocked by his own team-mate Eddie Nketiah, summing up a chastening outing for Oliver Glasner's team. No wind beneath Eagles' wings
The news that the Premier League will have five Champions League spots for next season also came as music to the ears of Crystal Palace supporters. Glasner's men were targeting Europe when they won seven of 10 league games between mid-January and Saturday's trip to Manchester City. There was little Palace could do when Murphy sent a rocket of a shot into the top-right corner, but Wednesday's game got away from them within the space of two minutes late in the first half. Pope refused to blink when Eze – who had scored both of his previous Premier League penalties – stepped up, and he only had to make the slightest movement to his left to hold a tame attempt. Palace will now surely see the FA Cup as their most likely route to Europe. Club reports

Bryan Mbeumo’s brace and a Yoane Wissa goal proved to be the difference between the two sides and condemned the Saints to their third straight loss since promotion back to the Premier League. With departed striker Toney watching in the stands after his move to Al-Ahli in Saudi Arabia, the hosts proved too strong for Russell Martin’s men. Mbeumo opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time before doubling the lead halfway through the second period and Wissa then got on the scoresheet moments later to continue Brentford’s strong start to the campaign. Brentford sit in fifth place ahead of the first international break, while Southampton are second-bottom of the league table with zero points. His opposite number Mark Flekken was also busy early on, saving Kyle Walker-Peters’ effort from a tight angle, before Joe Aribo looped a header onto the crossbar from the resulting corner. Wissa had a superb chance later in the first half but miscued his chip over the onrushing Ramsdale, and the visitors were then able to clear their lines. Bryan Mbeumo made no mistake on the rebound of a stinging low shot from Kevin Schade, which had smacked the post after defender Taylor Harwood-Bellis had been dispossessed in a perilous position. Schade had an opportunity to double Brentford’s lead after the start but couldn’t generate enough power on his header after a fabulous curling cross from the right by Mbeumo. The Cameroon international then doubled his and his side’s advantage in the 65th minute, finishing off a quick Bees move after the Southampton backline were once again dispossessed deep in their own half. Wissa got in on the act moments later, bundling home after Ramsdale struggled to claw out a looping header from a long throw. The home side could have added even further gloss to the scoreline, but last-ditch Saints defending denied Wissa from further adding to his account. Bees continue solid start as post-Toney era begins
Thomas Frank will be delighted with the vibrancy of his side’s display, with Brentford now having recorded two wins out of three. The Dane can also now look ahead to a new era without Toney. He will be a big loss, but Brentford proved they still have firepower up front in the form of Wissa and Mbeumo. They dovetailed devastatingly this afternoon, with Mbeumo bagging two goals for himself to take his total to three already for the season. Wissa, meanwhile, is also on two league goals in three games. Nevertheless, Frank will be delighted by his side’s first three performances of the new season and six points secured, with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium their next opponent. Nevertheless, the nature of the first two goals will be of concern to Martin, with Harwood-Bellis and Jack Stephens both struggling to deal with Brentford’s press for the first two goals. That allowed Brentford’s backline to squeeze up and force the away side into errors in precarious areas of the pitch, which ultimately contributed to the result being as comfortable as it was in the end.

New signing Aaron Ramsdale was called into action just a minute into his Southampton debut, coming off his line quickly to deny Mikkel Damsgaard giving the home side a dream start. His opposite number Mark Flekken was also busy early on, saving Kyle Walker-Peters’ effort from a tight angle, before Joe Aribo looped a header onto the crossbar from the resulting corner. Southampton could have equalised straight away through Adam Armstrong, but he fluffed his volley from close range with the goal at his mercy. The Cameroon international then doubled his and his side’s advantage in the 65th minute, finishing off a quick Bees move after the Southampton backline were once again dispossessed deep in their own half.

94,94,manchester-united,2024-09-01,"Arne Slot maintained his perfect start as Liverpool head coach as the Reds ran riot in a resounding 3-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. The Egyptian scored against United in the Premier League for the 12th time after the break, Liverpool punishing yet another mistake from the Red Devils' midfield to add some gloss to the scoreline. The triumph sees Liverpool join Manchester City as the only two sides with 100 per cent records after three matches, while United enter the international break in 14th with three points. How the match unfolded
Having seen Diogo Jota flash an effort wide of Andre Onana’s goal early on, Liverpool thought they had silenced the Old Trafford faithful in the sixth minute. Salah got his name on the scoresheet after 56 minutes, finishing into the bottom-right corner after Kobbie Mainoo had been dispossessed in midfield, as things threatened to get ugly for United. United lose midfield battle
Much of the talk throughout Erik ten Hag’s time in the United dugout has centred on the Red Devils' lack of tactical identity, and their much-maligned midfield was ruthlessly exposed again by Liverpool. The opening exchanges saw Zirkzee and Bruno Fernandes attempt to press from the front. But fellow midfield youngster Mainoo was then culpable when Salah scored his 10th goal in nine appearances at Old Trafford, seeing his pocket pinched by Alexis Mac Allister, who got the Reds motoring upfield again. Upon Anthony Taylor’s final whistle, boos echoed around Old Trafford, with Ten Hag given plenty of food for thought during the international break. Slot machine pays out jackpot
Liverpool’s trip to Old Trafford marked their sternest test under Slot to date, but the Dutchman passed it with flying colours.

95,95,liverpool,2024-09-01,"Arne Slot maintained his perfect start as Liverpool head coach as the Reds ran riot in a resounding 3-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Luis Diaz’s header handed the visitors the advantage 10 minutes before half-time, after Trent Alexander-Arnold had seen a potential early opener chalked off following a VAR review. Diaz then doubled his tally seven minutes later with a low finish into the bottom corner after being picked out by an intricate pass from Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian scored against United in the Premier League for the 12th time after the break, Liverpool punishing yet another mistake from the Red Devils' midfield to add some gloss to the scoreline. The triumph sees Liverpool join Manchester City as the only two sides with 100 per cent records after three matches, while United enter the international break in 14th with three points. How the match unfolded
Having seen Diogo Jota flash an effort wide of Andre Onana’s goal early on, Liverpool thought they had silenced the Old Trafford faithful in the sixth minute. A sweeping move saw Alexander-Arnold convert at the back post despite the best efforts of Diogo Dalot on the line, with the goal awarded on-field but overturned after a VAR review as Salah was found to have been offside in the build-up. However, Slot’s side would get their noses in front in the 35th minute as a poor pass from Casemiro was intercepted, then Salah crossing for Diaz to nod home at the far post. The pair combined again to double the Reds’ advantage three minutes before the break, with Salah again the architect as his cute pass into the area was finished smartly by Diaz after Casemiro had been dispossessed. Salah got his name on the scoresheet after 56 minutes, finishing into the bottom-right corner after Kobbie Mainoo had been dispossessed in midfield, as things threatened to get ugly for United. United lose midfield battle
Much of the talk throughout Erik ten Hag’s time in the United dugout has centred on the Red Devils' lack of tactical identity, and their much-maligned midfield was ruthlessly exposed again by Liverpool. However, those behind them were not on the same page as Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate were able to get Liverpool moving upfield with relative ease. But fellow midfield youngster Mainoo was then culpable when Salah scored his 10th goal in nine appearances at Old Trafford, seeing his pocket pinched by Alexis Mac Allister, who got the Reds motoring upfield again. Slot machine pays out jackpot
Liverpool’s trip to Old Trafford marked their sternest test under Slot to date, but the Dutchman passed it with flying colours. Perhaps unlike his United counterpart, Slot has already stamped a recognised style upon his group of players, with their expansive and dynamic football building on the foundations laid during Jurgen Klopp’s glittering nine-year stint at Anfield. An unusually quiet transfer window saw Liverpool miss out on a defensive midfielder who might have been the final piece of the puzzle, though Ryan Gravenberch’s recent showings have suggested he has the quality to fill that void for the rest of the season. Diaz and Salah were the notable standouts on Sunday, with the latter becoming only the second player (after Alan Shearer at Elland Road) to score 10 goals at an away ground in the Premier League. Liverpool’s recent domination of this age-old fixture looks set to continue under the guidance of their new head coach, and their early-season showings might cause concern elsewhere in Manchester, too.

96,96,bournemouth,2025-04-14,"Antoine Semenyo’s first-minute goal proved decisive as AFC Bournemouth boosted their European hopes with a 1-0 victory over Fulham at the Vitality Stadium. Semenyo’s eighth Premier League goal of the season was enough to snap a run of six top-flight matches without a win for the Cherries. Bournemouth – who pegged Fulham back to a 2-2 draw late on in the reverse fixture in December – had to hold onto their lead for all but the opening 53 seconds of Monday’s encounter. Evanilson squandered a chance to make matters more comfortable for Bournemouth when he hit the crossbar from close range, but Fulham could not make their hosts pay for that profligacy. The victory takes Bournemouth up into eighth, a place above Fulham and right back in the mix for European qualification, while the Cottagers’ slim hopes of pushing for a UEFA Champions League place have likely been extinguished. Bournemouth have now matched their record Premier League points tally of 48, which they set last season. How the match unfolded
The Cherries hit the front as Semenyo pounced on Antonee Robinson’s loose touch and dispatched expertly beyond Bernd Leno. Semenyo is the scorer of Bournemouth's third-earliest goal in the Premier League after Philip Billing against Arsenal in March 2023 (nine seconds) and Matt Ritchie against Tottenham Hotspur in October 2015 (49 seconds). Bournemouth should have doubled their lead in the 17th minute. The hosts have hit the woodwork more times than any other Premier League side this season (21), with Evanilson the 10th different player to do so for Bournemouth. However, the Bournemouth goalkeeper was not really tested otherwise and, despite Evanilson seeing a penalty appeal waved away late on, Andoni Iraola’s team held firm to bring a welcome end to their winless streak. Bournemouth back on track
Without a win after 90 minutes in their last eight matches across all competitions, Bournemouth were also staring down the barrel of suffering five straight Premier League home defeats for the first time in their history. Evanilson cut a frustrated figure after he failed to add to their lead, but Fulham really never came all that close to truly testing Kepa, who was well protected by the excellent Dean Huijsen – the Bournemouth centre-back turning in a fine display on his 20th birthday. Having conceded two goals in each of their last five league outings, Bournemouth needed this clean sheet. Beating a fellow European contender will provide a timely boost for Iraola, whose team now take on Crystal Palace before going up against Manchester United, Arsenal, Aston Villa and Manchester City before rounding out their campaign against Leicester City.

The Cherries hit the front as Semenyo pounced on Antonee Robinson’s loose touch and dispatched expertly beyond Bernd Leno. Fulham looked to respond before half-time with Rodrigo Muniz and Ryan Sessegnon both heading straight at Kepa Arrizabalaga, though Leno had to be alert to Scott’s low drive at the other end. Leno came to the visitors' rescue again 10 minutes into the second half, keeping out Adams' volley from a Dango Ouattara cross, while Kepa pushed away an Alex Iwobi attempt. Evanilson cut a frustrated figure after he failed to add to their lead, but Fulham really never came all that close to truly testing Kepa, who was well protected by the excellent Dean Huijsen – the Bournemouth centre-back turning in a fine display on his 20th birthday. Fulham draw rare away blank
Fulham were fresh from stunning Premier League leaders Liverpool in their last outing, but the inconsistency that has seen Marco Silva’s side fail to put together back-to-back league victories since they overcame Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest back in February. Across their last eight league matches, Fulham have now alternated between defeats and wins, and the momentum they had from that brilliant victory over Liverpool swiftly dissipated with Semenyo’s early strike. That being said, Silva’s team came into this one having scored in all 14 of their away matches in the league this season, so they would not have been panicking. Iwobi failed to find his usual spark, while Muniz struggled to get into the game. Silva shuffled his pack with a triple change just before the hour-mark, and the visitors subsequently increased the pressure in their search for an equaliser. With such a congested race for the European places, Fulham will need to string together a run of positive results if they are to see off their rivals. Match reports

But it was Newcastle who struck first through Joelinton as the Magpies pounced on Alex McCarthy's error just before the break. Eddie Howe's side join a glut of sides on three points at the top of the early standings with Southampton in 17th, still seeking their first points. How the match unfolded
Southampton settled the quicker of the two sides and had the ball in the net following a neat build-up after 10 minutes - Will Smallbone helped Joe Aribo's cutback towards the far post for Stephens to tuck into an empty net before the offside flag came to Newcastle's rescue, with VAR confirming the assistant referee's call. However, Newcastle settled down and broke the deadlock just before half-time. McCarthy's loose pass was intercepted by Alexander Isak, who swiftly set up Joelinton to slot home. Southampton continued to enjoy large periods of possession after the break, and within five minutes of the restart, Amstrong was denied on the line before Nick Pope tipped over the former Newcastle striker's long-range effort. Armstrong then saw a shot deflect narrowly wide, while substitute Carlos Alcaraz headed straight at Pope as the visitors continued to carry the greater attacking threat, but their efforts proved in vain as the Magpies held on for all three points. Newcastle shut up shop
Had it not been for Manchester United's FA Cup final heroics at the end of last season, Newcastle's seventh-place finish would have secured them a second successive campaign featuring European football. A typically raucous atmosphere welcomed the players at St James' Park, but the anticipation among the home faithful turned to gasps of concern when Stephens' goal was ruled out, and they became more restless after the red card. The second half required a huge collective effort to preserve the lead, and Howe got just that from his players as they stubbornly kept their opponents at bay, ensuring a third-straight victory on matchday one for him and the Magpies. Southampton show promising signs
Back in the Premier League after a year away, Southampton's first port of call was a 650-mile round trip to St James' Park, where they had won just one of 18 previous top-flight visits. However, the difficulty of repeating that at a higher level was exposed with McCarthy's attempt to play out from the back culminating in them falling behind, and they were subsequently unable to respond, though not for lack of trying.

Back in the Premier League after a year away, Southampton's first port of call was a 650-mile round trip to St James' Park, where they had won just one of 18 previous top-flight visits. Russell Martin’s philosophy does not appear to have altered too much from last season with his side swiftly settling into their rhythm and enjoying large periods with the ball. Southampton are historically slow starters in the Premier League, having won just two of their opening games in the competition. And though disappointed not to have capitalised on their numerical advantage, Martin will be encouraged by what he saw from his players, who demonstrated plenty of confidence and looked a threat going forward.

Eddie Howe was open about Newcastle’s less-than-brilliant transfer window before kick-off, with their failed pursuit of Marc Guehi among the pieces of business they did not get over the line before Friday’s deadline. Newcastle once again showcased the defensive resilience that earned them Champions League football during the 2022/23 campaign, and it was needed to withstand the consistent waves of Spurs’ persistent attacking pressure. Going forward, Anthony Gordon offered the hosts a way out, but Spurs defended astutely during their search for a winner to try and end their recent hoodoo against the Magpies. Isak got off the mark for the season with arguably the easiest goal he will score this campaign thanks to Murphy’s unselfish square-ball, with the Swede confirming a triumph that will potentially come under the ""smash and grab category"".

After seeing Romero’s strike chalked off for offside, Ange Postecoglou’s side enjoyed a sustained spell of pressure, with Pape Sarr twice stinging the palms of Pope in quick succession. Wilson Odobert and Dejan Kulusevski also saw attempts blocked, with Barnes’ strike compounding their struggles in the final third as the visitors entered the break having registered only two shots on target.

102,102,chelsea,2025-04-13,"Jadon Sancho scored a sublime equaliser as Chelsea fought back to draw 2-2 with Ipswich Town in a thriller at Stamford Bridge. Substitute Sancho, who has been unable to cement a regular starting spot in Enzo Maresca’s side this season, showed what he can do with a sensational effort in the 79th minute on Sunday. But in a potential blow to their hopes of securing UEFA Champions League qualification, Chelsea – who went 2-0 down in the first half – could not find a way past an inspired Alex Palmer late on. Goals from Julio Enciso and Ben Johnson left the Blues stunned before the break, but Axel Tuanzebe’s own goal saw Chelsea pull one back just after the restart. Sancho’s curler restored parity, with Trevoh Chalobah, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez all going agonisingly close late on as Chelsea moved into fifth, but missed the chance to ensure they finished the weekend in the UEFA Champions League places. How the match unfolded
Nicolas Jackson squandered a great early chance for Chelsea when he clattered the woodwork from close range, and Ipswich made the Blues pay when Johnson squared for Enciso in the 19th minute. Jens Cajuste bent a 20-yard effort narrowly past Robert Sanchez’s post as boos began to ring around Stamford Bridge, and they grew louder when Enciso returned the favour to Johnson with a fine cross, and the defender headed home. But within seconds of the restart, Chelsea pulled one back – Noni Madueke surged down the right and supplied teasing ball towards Marc Cucurella, which the stretching Tuanzebe could only divert in. Goalkeeper Palmer was Ipswich’s hero as Chelsea pushed hard in the final stages, making a string of super stops to keep the hosts at bay. Chelsea’s bump in the road
A home match against one of the Premier League’s bottom three provided, on paper at least, an ideal opportunity for Chelsea to get firmly back on track in their push for Champions League qualification, following last week’s draw with Brentford. Yet Ipswich – who beat the Blues in the reverse fixture at Portman Road – ripped up the script and forced Chelsea to do it the hard way to salvage a point. With Manchester City and Aston Villa picking up big wins on Saturday, and Newcastle United still to play this weekend, this is a stumble Chelsea may not have been able to afford. Scrutiny over the suitability of Jackson, who is without a Premier League goal in 2025, as the man to lead Chelsea’s line forward is likely to continue after his early miss. Then there has been the dip in form of key man Palmer. With Everton, Liverpool and Manchester United the next three teams to visit Stamford Bridge in the league, the pressure is certainly on the race for the Champions League places. They have taken four points from their two matches from Chelsea this season and were well worthy of their first-half lead this time around. The performance of Palmer was also something Ipswich can look at fondly – his reactive saves at the end were exceptional. Match reports

104,104,liverpool,2025-04-13,"Liverpool moved two wins away from the Premier League title as Virgil van Dijk made amends for a late mistake with a last-gasp winner in a 2-1 victory over West Ham United. Sunday seemed set to belong to Mohamed Salah, who celebrated his new two-year contract at Anfield with an assist for Luis Diaz's 18th-minute opener. That saw Salah break the record for the most goal involvements in a 38-match season in the competition with 45, though his achievement was overshadowed by late drama. Van Dijk scuffed Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross on to Andy Robertson, who turned the ball into his own net with four minutes remaining, only for the Liverpool captain to then head in the winner from Alexis Mac Allister's 89th-minute corner. The late victory leaves Arne Slot's side needing only six points from their remaining six matches to clinch the title, while West Ham – who hit the bar in search of a second equaliser through substitute Niclas Fullkrug – drop to 17th spot. How the match unfolded
Salah flashed wide after skimming past Ollie Scarles early on, before repeating the dose just a minute later and, this time, curling a delightful pass for Diaz to tap into an empty net. West Ham almost struck back only three minutes later as Alisson denied Carlos Soler before Mohammed Kudus dinked a delicate chip over the Liverpool goalkeeper, only to be thwarted by the crossbar. Mac Allister's free-kick from a tight angle crashed against the woodwork shortly after the interval, though West Ham remained a threat as Soler blazed over and Alisson raced out to brilliantly deny Jarrod Bowen in a 1v1 situation. A deserved equaliser eventually arrived as Van Dijk hit Wan-Bissaka's left-sided delivery into Robertson, only for Diaz to rattle the crossbar at the other end moments later, before Van Dijk towered to power Mac Allister's corner past Alphonse Areola. Record-breaking Salah sets tone before late chaos
Salah's name continually echoed around Anfield as Liverpool supporters toasted the news of their Egyptian star's contract extension – and their hero soon repaid the rapturous show of faith. Salah continued in his role as chief creator, lifting through before seeing Areola deny Mac Allister, whose free-kick strike then rattled the woodwork following Jean-Clair Todibo's 46th-minute foul on Kostas Tsimikas. Mac Allister's mishit cross then almost found the top corner before Areola superbly tipped over, although Liverpool's unconvincing defence was deservedly punished at the other end by Robertson's unfortunate own goal. Sunday's second-half showing was far from the rip-roaring style of Liverpool's last title win under Jurgen Klopp in the 2019/20 season, but Slot's side still got over the line thanks to Van Dijk. Even if Arsenal remain perfect in their pursuit, this win means Liverpool can secure the title on 27 April with victory at home to Tottenham Hotspur, should the Reds also win at Leicester City next Sunday. Potter magic needed to turnaround West Ham form
Winless in four matches since a 2-0 victory over Leicester on 27 February, Graham Potter may have been fearing the worst heading into a thankless task at Anfield. Scarles was exposed by the quality of Salah from the off, too, with Lucas Paqueta and Kudus offering little protection for the 19-year-old wing-back, but West Ham certainly had their chances. Wan-Bissaka's offload almost freed Soler to slot past Alisson, who scrambled as Kudus' clipped rebound bounced off the woodwork. The midfielder was struck on the arm by Mac Allister's corner, but his action was deemed accidental after a VAR check agreed with referee Andy Madley's call of no penalty. Club reports

Konstantinos Mavropanos then headed off target on the stroke of half-time after a corner from James Ward-Prowse, who survived handball appeals for a home penalty in the second half. West Ham turned up the pressure from then as Paqueta freed Bowen, and Kudus forced a fine stop from Alisson before their reward came in fortuitous circumstances. There will be no comfort in the late drama, but Potter may seek the positives from a battling performance, despite West Ham dropping down the table before they host relegated Southampton next Saturday.

106,106,chelsea,2024-09-01,"Crystal Palace claimed their first point of the Premier League season by fighting back for a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Eberechi Eze’s superb 20-yard strike cancelled out Nicolas Jackson’s first-half effort and ensured the spoils were shared in an entertaining London derby. Jackson made it two goals in as many matches when he rounded off a fine Chelsea move midway through the first half, but the Blues could not convert their early dominance into a bigger lead. Enzo Maresca’s hosts missed the chance to move into the top half and sit 11th in the table with four points, while Palace climb to 16th. How the match unfolded
Chelsea quickly established control of proceedings with Cole Palmer curling inches wide of the far post and Noni Madueke – last weekend’s hat-trick hero at Wolverhampton Wanderers – also marginally off target. Dean Henderson then produced a superb reflex save to tip Madueke’s volley from an Enzo Fernandez cross onto the crossbar. However, the Palace goalkeeper was powerless as the Blues broke through in the 25th minute. A swift counter saw Madueke burst away from Will Hughes and feed Palmer, who delivered a low ball across the face of goal for Jackson to tap into an empty net. Henderson did come to the visitors’ rescue again early in the second half, pushing away Palmer’s dipping free-kick and stopping a Levi Colwill header. Chelsea continued to boss possession as the second half wore on, but Glasner’s side went closer to scoring when Daichi Kamada stung Sanchez’s palms 13 minutes from time. Jackson was denied by Henderson late on at the other end, but the two teams could not be separated. Blues pegged back
After rotating his squad for the midweek UEFA Europa Conference League play-off trip to Servette, Maresca made just a single change from last weekend’s 6-2 win at Molineux – handing a full debut to former Wolves winger Pedro Neto. Chelsea looked settled and confident during the first half, with their attacking players linking up and interchanging superbly. The Blues boast a large squad and the list of attacking options at their disposal is envious. They were deserving of their early lead with Palmer providing his fourth assist of the season already, with only four players in Premier League history bettering that tally after the opening three matches of a campaign. Palace end Chelsea blues
After a difficult start to the season, the last thing Palace would have wanted was a trip to Chelsea – the side that had condemned them to defeat in 13 successive Premier League meetings before Sunday's match. Ex-Chelsea defender Marc Guehi – remaining with the club despite being heavily linked with a move away from Selhurst Park – and company stood firm at the other end to keep the hosts at bay.

108,108,bournemouth,2024-09-14,"Christopher Nkunku proved Chelsea’s hero as his late strike secured a narrow 1-0 win over AFC Bournemouth in the Premier League. The forward came off the bench to strike the winner five minutes from time at the Vitality Stadium, where Robert Sanchez kept out Evanilson’s first-half penalty. Bournemouth looked the more likely to take all three points in the contest, and Chelsea had Sanchez to thank for his penalty heroics, albeit after he had conceded the spot-kick for a foul on Evanilson. Marcus Tavernier and Ryan Christie also struck the woodwork for the hosts, but the Blues landed the decisive blow in the closing stages to snatch the victory. Nkunku’s late intervention moves Enzo Maresca’s side up to seventh place on seven points, two more than Bournemouth, who are in 11th. How the match unfolded
Bournemouth carried the greater attacking threat early on and went close to breaking the deadlock after just four minutes when Tavernier's thunderous long-range strike rattled the crossbar. Bournemouth were handed a golden opportunity to take the lead in the 37th minute from the penalty spot when Sanchez tripped Evanilson, but the Chelsea goalkeeper redeemed himself by guessing correctly to deny the Brazilian. The Cherries went close again after the break with Sanchez keeping out Kluivert following a jinking run, before Evanilson's header was ruled out for offside. Bournemouth taste first defeat
It looked a real possibility that Bournemouth would be able to remain unbeaten in their opening four matches of a top-flight season for the first time, only to be stunted by their lack of clinical edge in the final third. Fresh from their miraculous late turnaround against Everton before the international break, the Cherries looked to be building on that momentum, and they will count themselves unlucky not to have broken the deadlock when in the ascendancy. Indeed, they found Sanchez in fine form, with the Chelsea goalkeeper guessing correctly to thwart Evanilson from the spot, while Tavernier and Christie were only inches away from hitting the net when their impressive attempts rattled the woodwork. And Iraola’s side were made to regret not capitalising on those opportunities with Nkunku’s piece of individual brilliance condemning them to a first league defeat of the campaign. But the Cherries head coach will surely take confidence from their performance once again, though they face another tough test at Liverpool next weekend. Club reports

Following their emphatic 6-2 win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers, Chelsea have now secured a fourth successive away win, achieving the feat for the first time in two years. Chelsea were also part of creating a small slice of history on Saturday, as 14 yellow cards were shown in a fiery encounter – the most in a single Premier League match, and previously beating the record of 12 which were shown in Chelsea vs Tottenham Hotspur in May 2016 and Wolves v Newcastle United in August 2010.

110,110,wolverhampton,2025-04-13,"Matheus Cunha scored on his return from suspension as Wolverhampton Wanderers made it four straight Premier League wins with a thrilling 4-2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. The Brazilian made his much-anticipated comeback as a substitute after serving a four-game ban and netted the goal that put the contest beyond the visitors at Molineux. Wolves are up to 16th in the table and 14 points clear of the bottom three with just six games remaining. The Algerian's strike was Wolves’ earliest Premier League goal ever from the start of a game, a record previously held by Pablo Sarabia (109 seconds v Southampton in November this season). Spurs almost gifted Wolves a second goal when Vicario's poor pass went straight to Marshall Munetsi, who found Strand Larsen, but he could only stab wide from close range. Richarlison gave the visitors hope once again when he headed in five minutes from time, but less than two minutes later, Cunha capitalised on some loose play from Lucas Bergvall before slotting home. Hungry like the Wolves
Wolves have hit form at an ideal time to drag themselves away from danger and are now on the verge of mathematically confirming their Premier League status for 2025/26. Although Spurs grew into the game, fortune was definitely on Wolves’ side for the second goal, which gave them breathing space heading into half-time, and the only negatives from their first-half display were the losses of Bellegarde and Matt Doherty to injury. The visitors made the stronger start to the second half, but Tel’s goal sparked Wolves back into life, and their alertness led to them punishing Romero’s error for their third goal. In tucking away Ait-Nouri’s square pass, Strand Larsen became only the second Wolves player to score in four successive Premier League games, matching the feat of Henri Camara 21 years earlier. Cunha was subsequently introduced to a wonderful reception after four games out, and it did not take long for him to make an impact. Moments after Richarlison narrowed the gap again, Cunha stole the ball from Bergvall and burst away from Ben Davies, before calmly sending Vicario the wrong way. Wolves have now won four straight top-flight games for the first time since January 1972. First, Romero was robbed of possession inside his own penalty area, while Bergvall’s naïve play allowed the returning Cunha to run almost half the length of the field and put the result beyond doubt.

111,111,tottenham-hotspur,2025-04-13,"Matheus Cunha scored on his return from suspension as Wolverhampton Wanderers made it four straight Premier League wins with a thrilling 4-2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Rayan Ait-Nouri and Jorgen Strand Larsen were also on target for Vitor Pereira’s side, while Spurs' Djed Spence put through his own net. Mathys Tel and Richarlison struck for Ange Postecoglou's visitors, but they could not avert a 10th away league defeat of the season. They are within one place and two points of Spurs in 15th. The Algerian's strike was Wolves’ earliest Premier League goal ever from the start of a game, a record previously held by Pablo Sarabia (109 seconds v Southampton in November this season). Spurs almost gifted Wolves a second goal when Vicario's poor pass went straight to Marshall Munetsi, who found Strand Larsen, but he could only stab wide from close range. Spurs halved the deficit after 59 minutes when Tel turned in Brennan Johnson’s cross at the far post, but another defensive lapse proved costly for Postecoglou’s side five minutes later, with Ait-Nouri pouncing on Cristian Romero’s error and squaring for Strand Larsen to tuck away. Richarlison gave the visitors hope once again when he headed in five minutes from time, but less than two minutes later, Cunha capitalised on some loose play from Lucas Bergvall before slotting home. Off the back of three straight wins, they did not take long to hit the front here, with Ait-Nouri capitalising after Spurs failed to deal with a free-kick, to score their fastest Premier League goal ever. Although Spurs grew into the game, fortune was definitely on Wolves’ side for the second goal, which gave them breathing space heading into half-time, and the only negatives from their first-half display were the losses of Bellegarde and Matt Doherty to injury. Moments after Richarlison narrowed the gap again, Cunha stole the ball from Bergvall and burst away from Ben Davies, before calmly sending Vicario the wrong way. Spurs' wounds self-inflicted
With Spurs' UEFA Europa League quarter-final second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt four days away, Postecoglou will have been looking for a positive performance from his side to build momentum. Spurs had lost all seven of their previous Premier League away games when conceding first this season, but they responded positively. Yves Bissouma's long-range effort stung Jose Sa's palms and Johnson fired narrowly over, before Spence’s calamitous own goal. Spurs must quickly recover, though, as attention now turns to Frankfurt and undoubtedly the biggest game of their season, with only a positive result enough to keep them on course to salvage something from an otherwise difficult campaign.

112,112,aston-villa,2024-09-14,"Jhon Duran’s screamer and Ollie Watkins’ brace completed a stunning turnaround for Aston Villa as they fought back to beat Everton 3-2 at Villa Park. The deficit awakened a previously struggling Watkins, who pulled one back before half-time by nodding home a Lucas Digne cross from close range. Watkins added to his tally after the break, tapping in after a mistake from Jack Harrison. Duran played super-sub yet again, entering the pitch on 69 minutes before firing Villa into the lead seven minutes later with a blistering strike from over 29 yards out. The victory lifts Villa into third place, only behind Liverpool on goal difference. It took a piece of individual brilliance in the 16th minute, as McNeil won possession from Amadou Onana in the Villa defensive line before firing into the far bottom right corner from the top of the box. Digne chipped a ball from the left byline to the far post where Watkins arrived first to nod it past Jordan Pickford. On 58 minutes, Villa had cancelled out Everton's lead as Youri Tielemans' long ball over the top was deflected into the path of Watkins by Everton’s Harrison, leaving the striker with little to do to tap home and double his tally. Duran delivered spectacularly to complete Villa’s comeback in the 76th minute as he rifled a blistering shot screamer into the roof of the net, leaving Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez shocked. Watkins back in the goals for Villa
Prior to Saturday, Watkins had not scored for Villa since 14 April, exactly five months ago to the day. Against Everton, however, he proved instrumental in the hosts’ comeback as he provided both goals that brought Unai Emery’s side level with Everton, before Duran finished the job. Watkins returned to Villa off the back of reaching the UEFA EURO 2024 final with England, having scored the decisive goal to put the Three Lions through in the semi-finals. It is a tough ask for any player to return to form after a shortened pre-season, but the expectations on Watkins are such that he is not afforded the luxury of being eased back into action with little scrutiny. Today, however, Villa Park witnessed his impressive finishing return and, with it, his confidence. While the visitors’ attacking instinct has visibly improved as they doubled their season’s goal tally inside the opening 30 minutes of their encounter at Villa Park, their defensive discipline remains lacking.

113,113,everton,2024-09-14,"Jhon Duran’s screamer and Ollie Watkins’ brace completed a stunning turnaround for Aston Villa as they fought back to beat Everton 3-2 at Villa Park. Everton remain without a point in the Premier League this season, despite having gone two goals up in back-to-back matches. Dwight McNeil gave Everton the lead against the run of play on 16 minutes, before turning provider for Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s header. Watkins added to his tally after the break, tapping in after a mistake from Jack Harrison. Everton, meanwhile, remain stuck to the bottom having lost four out of four in the Premier League. How the match unfolded
Everton’s first chance of the match provided their first goal. It took a piece of individual brilliance in the 16th minute, as McNeil won possession from Amadou Onana in the Villa defensive line before firing into the far bottom right corner from the top of the box. The visitors were two goals to the good just 11 minutes later as McNeil turned provider to float an inch-perfect free-kick into the box off the right where Calvert-Lewin rose highest to head home. Digne chipped a ball from the left byline to the far post where Watkins arrived first to nod it past Jordan Pickford. On 58 minutes, Villa had cancelled out Everton's lead as Youri Tielemans' long ball over the top was deflected into the path of Watkins by Everton’s Harrison, leaving the striker with little to do to tap home and double his tally. Calvert-Lewin nearly levelled soon after to spoil the party but his shot bounced back off the crossbar. Against Everton, however, he proved instrumental in the hosts’ comeback as he provided both goals that brought Unai Emery’s side level with Everton, before Duran finished the job. Defensive deja vu for Dyche
Everton were left reeling in their final match before the international break having found themselves two goals up, only to lose 3-2 to a resurgent AFC Bournemouth side. Sean Dyche will be left wondering if he is living in a recurring nightmare after his side once more find themselves leaving with zero points having had a two-goal lead. Dyche was forced into an early defensive change as Vitalii Mykolenko went down injured in the 26th minute, leading to the introduction of natural midfielder James Garner. The substitute was at fault for Watkins’ first goal, giving Digne far too much space, but Everton’s 13 goals conceded in four matches cannot be pinned on one substitution. Dyche looks increasingly under pressure after watching his side cede a comfortable lead twice in a row, as Everton remain pointless in the league. Club reports

Having endured a difficult start, Brighton found their groove with goals from Karou Mitoma, Danny Welbeck and Simon Adingra securing an impressive triumph. Mitoma rounded off a fine first-half move after being picked out by debutant Yankuba Minteh, with Welbeck adding a second in the 56th minute. Everton’s chances of a comeback were all but halted 10 minutes later as Ashley Young was given his marching orders for a pull on goalscorer Mitoma, with Adingra adding a third four minutes from time before Yasin Ayari saw a goal awarded on-pitch but overturned after a VAR review
The result sees Brighton – at least temporarily – top the pile, with Everton propping up the table. But Brighton offered a warning of their attacking quality when Joao Pedro struck the woodwork and, albeit against the run of play, they took a 25th-minute lead when Mitoma finished from close range after he was picked out at the back post by Minteh. Everton seemed to have been handed a lifeline when Dominic Calvert-Lewin tangled with Lewis Dunk in Brighton’s area, but after awarding a penalty on-pitch, the VAR Chris Kavanagh advised referee Simon Hooper to review the decision.

Sean Dyche’s frustrations only grew when Idrissa Gueye’s loose pass was punished by Welbeck, who coolly swept home from the edge of the area to put Brighton in complete control. Young became the oldest player to receive a Premier League red card after a heavy touch led him to pulling back Mitoma, and Adingra was on hand to add further gloss to a convincing win with a fine finish from outside of the box in the 86th minute.

116,116,manchester-city,2024-09-14,"Erling Haaland continued his sensational start to the new Premier League season with a brace that meant Manchester City came from behind to beat Brentford 2-1 on Saturday. Haaland, the EA SPORTS Premier League Player of the Month for August, had netted hat-tricks in his prior two appearances but had to settle for just the two goals at the Etihad Stadium, moving to 99 for City in all competitions. Yoane Wissa had stunned City after only 22 seconds of the match after capitalising on a defensive mix-up, but Haaland was not kept quiet for long. City’s master marksman had Pep Guardiola’s side back on terms in the 19th minute, before scoring what proved to be the winner before half-time. Haaland came close to completing another treble and bringing up his City century, but the champions had to survive a nervy finish to preserve the Premier League’s only 100 winning record at the top of the table, with Brentford back in seventh place. Liverpool's shock home loss to Nottingham Forest means Man City are three points clear at the top of the table. How the match unfolded 
The visitors stunned City with just 22 seconds on the clock when Keane Lewis-Potter’s header caused confusion in the penalty area, with Wissa the beneficiary as he nodded past Ederson. But parity was restored as Haaland netted again, firing a first-time right-footed effort across Mark Flekken into the far corner with the aid of a deflection. The turnaround was complete before half-time as Ederson’s long ball forward was misjudged by Ethan Pinnock, letting Haaland in to dink over Flekken. Where Ederson assisted Haaland from
Brentford continued to look a threat on the break, but the hosts created the better of the chances, with Jack Grealish and Savinho going close. Haaland thundered against a post when Flekken was beaten a third time, with his wait for a milestone goal going on. Haaland one off 100
Haaland’s involvement in this match had not been certain following the death of a family friend, but he was named in the starting XI and continued where he left off before the international break. Despite Brentford’s impressive start, it felt inevitable that Haaland would eventually make his mark on proceedings and did so with a fine finish, before doubling his tally in the first half to continue his hot streak for the defending Premier League champions. Haaland came so close to improving that tally further when he struck the frame of the goal, while Flekken also had to be at his best to deny the striker another hat-trick matchball. It is City’s potential title rivals Arsenal who are up next in the Premier League and must now come up with a plan to contain Haaland, who is enjoying a remarkable start to the campaign. Bees lack clinical sting 
Brentford caused City real problems, but they were too often lacking a decisive touch in the final third as they fell to defeat. Brentford did not possess the same threat for much of the second half, although Yegor Yarmolyuk’s dragged effort in the first minute of stoppage time had City supporters with their hearts in their mouths. Despite defeat in one of the toughest fixtures of the Premier League season, Brentford would have left the Etihad encouraged by a performance that could easily have upset City.

118,118,newcastle-united,2025-04-13,"Harvey Barnes scored twice as Newcastle United dispatched Manchester United 4-1 to move into fourth place in the Premier League. A dominant Newcastle, whose boss Eddie Howe was absent due to illness, took a deserved lead through Sandro Tonali, though Alejandro Garnacho restored parity with a breakaway goal before the break. A mistake from Altay Bayindir – who replaced Andre Onana in Man Utd's goal – enabled Newcastle to add more gloss in the 77th minute, with Bruno Guimaraes slotting in their fourth. Newcastle are now one point behind third-placed Nottingham Forest, with a game in hand on the teams around them, while United drop below Everton into 14th on goal difference. How the match unfolded
The hosts thought they had an opener just 40 seconds in, Joelinton cushioning Kieran Trippier’s cross in from close range, only for the offside flag to deny him. Alexander Isak’s smart flick took Leny Yoro out of the game, and Tonali picked out the bottom-left corner on the volley. Bayindir pounced on to an Isak volley to keep the score down, and United capitalised on that save moments later as Garnacho finished off Diogo Dalot’s driving counter by slotting his finish through Fabian Schar’s legs. Newcastle required less than four second-half minutes to regain their lead. And the St James’ Park faithful had more to cheer when Bayindir saw a poor pass cut out by Joelinton. Magpies soar in Howe’s absence
Newcastle did not have Howe on the touchline after the club confirmed he had been taken to hospital in recent days due to illness, but his assistant Jason Tindall insisted the Magpies would put in a performance their manager would be proud of. And with the race for the top five heating up, Newcastle went on the offensive from the start, with Murphy and Isak flashing efforts narrowly wide before Tonali opened the scoring with a fine finish. The Magpies sometimes lacked answers to United’s first-half counter-attacks, but they were free-flowing going the other way against a shaky Red Devils defence, with Tonali and Isak dovetailing nicely. Newcastle did not let their heads drop after conceding the equaliser and adopted the same front-footed approach after the break, with swift reward as Barnes followed up his goal against Leicester City on Monday with a brace. Newcastle, who earned a first Premier League double over United, are looking well set to secure a return to the UEFA Champions League, with Crystal Palace at home next up on Wednesday night in what is their game in hand. United looked rattled from the start, but the pressure eventually told in the second half, with the visitors unable to find any stability as endless Newcastle attacks rained down on their backline.

Newcastle, who earned a first Premier League double over United, are looking well set to secure a return to the UEFA Champions League, with Crystal Palace at home next up on Wednesday night in what is their game in hand. Amorim’s problems mount
United’s struggles at both ends of the pitch have been well-documented this season, and Ruben Amorim made changes to try and turn their fortunes in the final stretch. Onana dropped to the bench after his errors in United’s UEFA Europa League draw with Lyon on Thursday, meaning Bayindir came in for a Premier League debut. He almost conceded inside the opening minute without having a touch of the ball, though the offside flag offered United a reprieve. With United having drawn blanks in their last two league outings, Joshua Zirkzee was trusted to lead the line and almost followed up his midweek goal by finishing off a flowing one-touch sequence on the edge of the box, but Nick Pope parried over. Chances were few and far between, though – Garnacho was unable to double his tally just before the break as Pope pushed his curler behind on stretch, while Bruno Fernandes struggled to demonstrate his usual flair as he was kept on the fringes of the action. United looked rattled from the start, but the pressure eventually told in the second half, with the visitors unable to find any stability as endless Newcastle attacks rained down on their backline.

120,120,arsenal,2024-08-17,"Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka were on target as Arsenal began the new Premier League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Emirates Stadium. Germany international Havertz had the home fans on their feet midway through the first half thanks to a wonderful assist from Saka in sunny north London on Saturday. The hosts were not quite as convincing in a second period as Wolves upped their match, though Havertz did miss a great chance to double the lead. But the brilliant Saka ensured there would be no misstep to start a campaign in which Arsenal are looking to go one better than a second-place finish last term. Victory means the Gunners join fellow potential title contenders Liverpool and Manchester United among the teams on three points, with Wolves in the bottom three, albeit after only one match. How the match unfolded
Saka had been one of Arsenal's main tormentors-in-chiefs, twice seeing tame efforts saved by Jose Sa. Before, delivering a superb whipped cross from the right headed home by Havertz after 25 minutes. It needed a remarkable save from David Raya to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen a debut Wolves goal, while at the other end Joao Gomes made a terrific block to frustrate Gabriel Martinelli after a terrific through ball from Declan Rice. Havertz bent wide of the right post shortly after the restart and Thomas Partey curled off target from the edge of the box as Arsenal probed for a second. Wolves certainly picked up, though, and substitute Matheus Cunha should have done more to make William Saliba pay for a misplaced pass. That profligacy was punished when Saka stepped inside Rayan Ait-Nouri on the right of the area and beat Sa at his near post to take the match beyond Wolves in the 74th minute. Silky Saka shines as the Gunners get going 
Saka, of course, suffered Euro 2024 final heartbreak with England a little over a month ago but there were few signs of scars from that painful defeat to Spain. His cross for Havertz's opener was whipped, dipped, and near-enough undefendable – his German team-mate could hardly have missed in all honesty. There were a couple of signs of early-season rust from the Gunners in a second period, when Wolves certainly had their chances, though, and a packed-out Emirates Stadium was certainly getting agitated. But Saka once more had Ait-Nouri back-tracking before firing home Arsenal's second and if he and captain Martin Odegaard, who also impressed in the middle of the park, keep finding fluidity, then there is no reason Arsenal cannot challenge for the title again after finishing an agonising two points behind Manchester City last season. But it is fair to say they will have easier challenges, especially in defence where the Gunners' ability to move the ball in the tightest of spaces caused a plethora of issues. Ait-Nouri is a top Premier League performer but spent a lot of time being twisted this way and that by Saka, and you sense he will not be the only left-sided defender to endure such treatment this season. Toti Gomes had his struggles too and on another day might have given away a penalty after clumsy work in the area when challenging Saka. There were positives to take from this defeat too, not least the fact it took a wonderful stop from Raya to deny Larsen from Hwang Hee-chan's cross that rivalled Saka's for technical ability. What managers said
Mikel Arteta: ""The lack of control in the second half [we can improve], we gave so many simple balls away. I obviously don't like losing but we gave Arsenal a tough match. ""

Pep Guardiola's team produced arguably their best performance of the season in the second half, with Mateo Kovacic, James McAtee and Nico O’Reilly scoring to condemn Palace to their first defeat in 11 away Premier League games. With Newcastle United and Chelsea not playing until Sunday, City took advantage to move above them into fourth, while Palace stay 11th. How the match unfolded
City made the brighter start but found themselves behind when, following a sweeping move, an unmarked Eze tucked away Ismaila Sarr's cross at the far post. City came roaring back, halving their deficit in the 33rd minute as De Bruyne whipped a 25-yard free-kick in off the post. The hosts completed the turnaround within two minutes of the second half, with De Bruyne teeing up Kovacic to fire home from 20 yards, but they were not done there. De Bruyne shows City what they will miss
De Bruyne continued his Premier League farewell tour here, making his first appearance at the Etihad Stadium since announcing he will leave Man City at the end of 2024/25. However, he soon put things right with a lovely free-kick, before Marmoush grabbed his sixth goal in as many appearances at City's home ground. City were rampant after half-time as De Bruyne teed up Kovacic for his 14th goal involvement against Palace in the Premier League; his joint-most against any opponent. Youngsters McAtee, who had headed a glorious first-half chance wide, and O’Reilly then made the result safe, with City recovering from a shaky start to keep themselves well in the hunt for Champions League qualification. One slight concern for Guardiola will be the fitness of Ederson, however, after the goalkeeper limped off late on. Everton and Aston Villa are next up for City, before attention turns to their FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest – and their last hope of salvaging silverware from the campaign. Eagles brought back down to earth
Palace arrived at the Etihad Stadium seeking to extend their longest unbeaten Premier League run away from Selhurst Park, stretching back 10 matches. By half-time, their lead had disappeared, and City only grew stronger in the second half. Club reports

123,123,crystal-palace,2025-04-12,"Kevin De Bruyne played a starring role as Manchester City came from behind to beat Crystal Palace 5-2 at the Etihad Stadium. Goals from Eberechi Eze and Chris Richards put Palace in the driving seat midway through the first half. Shortly afterwards, Eze thought he had made it 3-0 to the Eagles but the goal was disallowed after being flagged offside by the linesman. Pep Guardiola's team produced arguably their best performance of the season in the second half, with Mateo Kovacic, James McAtee and Nico O’Reilly scoring to condemn Palace to their first defeat in 11 away Premier League games.

City made the brighter start but found themselves behind when, following a sweeping move, an unmarked Eze tucked away Ismaila Sarr's cross at the far post. Palace doubled their lead in the 21st minute when Richards nodded in Adam Wharton's corner, while semi-automated offside technology – which is being used in the Premier League for the first time this weekend – confirmed the decision to chalk off another Eze strike. City were rampant after half-time as De Bruyne teed up Kovacic for his 14th goal involvement against Palace in the Premier League; his joint-most against any opponent. Eagles brought back down to earth
Palace arrived at the Etihad Stadium seeking to extend their longest unbeaten Premier League run away from Selhurst Park, stretching back 10 matches. Oliver Glasner’s side had also gone seven games in all competitions without losing, and their confidence was evident whenever they countered early on. The Eagles had plenty of joy down the right flank, from where they broke the deadlock through Eze, while the corner that led to Richards’ goal also came from that side. However, the momentum seemed to shift when Sarr fired over from eight yards out, before Eze saw a potential third goal chalked off due to a narrow offside decision. Glasner attempted to bolster his midfield by taking off Jean-Philippe Mateta for Will Hughes at the break, but the hosts were just too strong and were never going to relent once they got their noses in front. Despite the defeat, there were still plenty of positives for Palace, and that is what they must focus on with Newcastle, AFC Bournemouth and Arsenal providing their next three Premier League opponents, before facing Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals.

124,124,liverpool,2024-09-14,"Callum Hudson-Odoi's goal gave Nottingham Forest their first league victory at Anfield in 55 years and ended Liverpool's perfect start to life under Arne Slot on Saturday. Liverpool had earlier gone close through Luis Diaz as he struck the base of a post in the first half, but they struggled to pose Nuno Espirito Santo's men too many problems in a flat display. The defeat, which comes after impressive shutout victories over Ipswich Town, Brentford and Manchester United, means Liverpool have lost early ground on Manchester City, who now boast a three-point lead at the top of the Premier League table. Matz Sels proved his worth for the visitors in the first half, making saves at close range to deny Diogo Jota and Alexis Mac Allister, then being forced into action directly from a corner by Trent Alexander-Arnold in the 35th minute. Amid an uncharacteristically quiet display, Mohamed Salah came alive in the 51st minute, twisting and turning to fire a shot towards the near post, but once more, Sels proved equal to it. Anthony Elanga then blazed over as Forest fired Liverpool a warning shot, but Hudson-Odoi went one better with 18 minutes to play. Cutting inside from the left, he bent an effort towards the far corner, carrying it out of Alisson's reach to stun Anfield and condemn Liverpool to defeat. While Hudson-Odoi’s strike sealed Forest’s first win away at Liverpool since defeating Bill Shankly’s side 2-0 in 1969, it was their defence that formed the foundations of their success. Early tests from Salah were dealt with effectively by Alex Moreno and Murillo, who could match the Egyptian for pace down the hosts' right flank when it mattered in the first half. On the other side, Ola Aina had another stellar performance, notably quelling the threat of Jota, who until Saturday had provided an effective spearhead to the Liverpool attack. Other than one self-inflicted wobble, Sels also held firm in the Forest goal to deny a string of chances for Liverpool in the first half and a further flurry in the closing stages of the match. Time after time a usually fluid Liverpool attack stalled on the offence as Nuno's men maintained their excellent start to the new campaign. Slot handed reality check
Slot’s flying start to life at Liverpool was brought to a sudden halt as their post-international break lethargy was met by an in-form Forest side. Slot had won his first three matches in charge and, for 72 minutes, looked set to become the first-ever Premier League manager to keep a clean sheet in his first four matches in charge. His side looked utterly dominant in the first half, with Forest barely getting a sight of goal, but Liverpool lacked that killer instinct to make their control count. Slot realised his predicament with 30 minutes to go as he made a triple substitution in the hope of inspiring change, but his side only caught on with 10 minutes to go when a last-minute burst of energy proved too little, too late.

125,125,nottingham-forest,2024-09-14,"Callum Hudson-Odoi's goal gave Nottingham Forest their first league victory at Anfield in 55 years and ended Liverpool's perfect start to life under Arne Slot on Saturday. Substitute Hudson-Odoi scored the only goal of the game after 72 minutes, capping a lightning Forest counter-attack with a curling strike that went in off a post. Liverpool had earlier gone close through Luis Diaz as he struck the base of a post in the first half, but they struggled to pose Nuno Espirito Santo's men too many problems in a flat display. Forest, meanwhile, remain unbeaten in 2024/25 and move up into fourth place with eight points, just one behind Saturday's opponents, who stay second. How the match unfolded
Diaz had the first real chance of the match when he rattled a post after 16 minutes, dispossessing Ryan Yates at the byline before cutting inside from the left and seeing his shot bounce clear off the woodwork. Sels almost caused Forest's undoing just before half-time as he spilled Diaz's looping header, but his scrambling recovery just prevented the ball from trickling over the line. Anthony Elanga then blazed over as Forest fired Liverpool a warning shot, but Hudson-Odoi went one better with 18 minutes to play. Forest defence forms foundations for success
Forest remain unbeaten through their first four Premier League matches of 2024/25 after passing their toughest test yet with flying colours.

Ipswich impressed in flashes in their first Premier League match since 2002, but Liverpool ultimately had too much as the Slot era began with a comfortable triumph at Portman Road. Liverpool host Brentford next weekend, while Ipswich have another tough task against champions Manchester City. How the match unfolded
Jacob Greaves and Omari Hutchinson tested Alisson in Ipswich’s best openings of a stop-start first half, though a slack pass from Luke Woolfenden almost gifted Liverpool the lead – Christian Walton smothering the danger ahead of Luis Diaz. Virgil van Dijk’s clumsy challenge on Liam Delap had Ipswich up in arms shortly after the restart, but the offside flag came to Liverpool’s rescue, with VAR confirming the linesman’s call. It was soon 2-0, with Salah poking beyond Walton from the edge of the six-yard box after slick combination play with Szoboszlai, and a comeback proved out of Ipswich’s reach. Liverpool could not get into their groove before then, albeit while restricting Ipswich to little in the way of clear-cut chances, but they came into their own after the interval. Encouraging signs for Ipswich
Pop superstar and minority Ipswich shareholder Ed Sheeran was on hand to take in the first half at Portman Road, and he will have been impressed with what he saw from Kieran McKenna’s men by the time he headed off at the interval – work commitments meaning he could not view the second half in person. Ipswich certainly gave a good account of themselves prior to the break. Indeed, had Hutchinson been able to generate more purchase and power on his attempt, which came at the end of a long run, then perhaps he would have been able to beat Alisson. With Man City next up, life does not get any easier for the Tractor Boys, but this is the task ahead of them in the big time. Club reports

Ipswich impressed in flashes in their first Premier League match since 2002, but Liverpool ultimately had too much as the Slot era began with a comfortable triumph at Portman Road. Liverpool's goals came in quick succession, Diogo Jota opening the scoring on the hour with a composed close-range finish. Having supplied the assist for the opener, Mohamed Salah then got in on the act himself in the 65th minute, and Slot’s side showed no sign of slipping up from there. Liverpool host Brentford next weekend, while Ipswich have another tough task against champions Manchester City. How the match unfolded
Jacob Greaves and Omari Hutchinson tested Alisson in Ipswich’s best openings of a stop-start first half, though a slack pass from Luke Woolfenden almost gifted Liverpool the lead – Christian Walton smothering the danger ahead of Luis Diaz. Virgil van Dijk’s clumsy challenge on Liam Delap had Ipswich up in arms shortly after the restart, but the offside flag came to Liverpool’s rescue, with VAR confirming the linesman’s call. But after that warning, Liverpool picked up the pace. Diaz skied over from close range, while Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister saw goalbound strikes blocked by Greaves and Woolfenden respectively, before Jota headed wide from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s delivery. But Jota made no mistake from his next chance, coolly side-footing home after Salah had got in behind Leif Davis. It was soon 2-0, with Salah poking beyond Walton from the edge of the six-yard box after slick combination play with Szoboszlai, and a comeback proved out of Ipswich’s reach. Slot off to a strong start 
Not since Gerard Houllier in 1998 had a Liverpool manager won their first Premier League match in charge, but Slot ensured that run did not continue. Liverpool could not get into their groove before then, albeit while restricting Ipswich to little in the way of clear-cut chances, but they came into their own after the interval. Salah, who was on the fringes of things out on the right flank in the opening 45 minutes, was integral, calmly laying it on a plate for Jota before he showed his clinical nature in front of goal to double the Reds’ tally. There will certainly be some teething issues for Slot, whose team went close to a third late on through substitute Conor Bradley, but with such a depth of attacking firepower at Liverpool’s disposal, that quality should buy the former Feyenoord coach time to get his approach to click. Yet last season’s surprise package in the Championship were, in the end, taught that in the blink of an eye, the best teams the Premier League has to offer can all but settle contests, and that is just what Liverpool did.

Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side had lost their last eight games in the competition without scoring, but they showed tremendous fight to take a point from the Amex Stadium. After Joao Pedro broke the deadlock from the penalty spot, Stephy Mavididi equalised to end Leicester’s 13-hour wait for a league goal. Joao Pedro restored the Seagulls’ lead with another spot-kick but Caleb Okoli’s first Premier League goal was enough to halt the Foxes’ losing run, and they even went close to a winner when Bilal El Khannouss struck the post. How the match unfolded
Brighton quickly established their authority and broke through in the 31st minute. Joao Pedro calmly tucked away from 12 yards after Conor Coady was penalised for handling Simon Adingra's strike, following a VAR review. Matt O'Riley should have restored the Seagulls' lead when he sent a free header wide soon after, before striking the post in first-half stoppage time. Once again, Joao Pedro coolly sent Mads Hermansen the wrong way. Missed opportunity for Brighton
Despite suffering three successive defeats in all competitions, Brighton knew this was a decent opportunity to get back to winning ways and apply pressure on the top five. The Seagulls began brightly enough with Yankuba Minteh just unable to turn home Adingra’s deep cross, while the latter also fired narrowly off target before Joao Pedro opened the scoring. Though they were pegged back before half-time, Brighton were soon back on top and restored their lead through another Joao Pedro penalty. However, Leicester refused to lie down and if anything, Brighton were grateful to end the game with a point, with their winless streak stretching to four matches. Brighton know they cannot afford to dwell on that for too long, though, as the battle for European football intensifies. Newcastle United and leaders Liverpool are still to come, though they are the only top-half sides the Seagulls will face in their seven remaining games. Things did not look promising when Joao Pedro put Brighton ahead with the first of his penalties just after the half-hour mark. Leicester had to survive a couple of nervy moments before half-time, and they trailed again within 10 minutes of the restart after another well-taken Joao Pedro penalty. Club reports

130,130,brentford,2024-08-18,"Brentford made light of Ivan Toney's absence to start their 2024/25 Premier League campaign with a 2-1 London derby victory over Crystal Palace, as Yoane Wissa netted a second-half winner. Bees talisman Toney was left out of the hosts’ squad for Sunday’s match at the Gtech Community Stadium, with Thomas Frank confirming before kick-off that the decision was made due to transfer interest in the striker. But his absence was not felt as Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring just before the half-hour mark, cutting onto his favoured left foot to stroke into the bottom-left corner. However, Palace - who saw efforts from Eberechi Eze and Odsonne Edouard disallowed in either half - came on strong in the second period and levelled through Ethan Pinnock’s own goal. The Eagles were caught out as the match became stretched, though, with Wissa converting from close range 14 minutes from time to seal the points for Brentford, and their first Premier League victory over Palace, moving them up to fifth in the early standings. Referee Samuel Barrott had, however, awarded a free-kick to Brentford for a foul by Will Hughes on Nathan Collins. Brentford took full advantage of that reprieve three minutes later, as a flowing move down the right culminated in Mbeumo cutting inside to bend home. Increased Palace pressure paid off after 56 minutes, though - Pinnock turning into his own net after Daniel Munoz had headed across the face of goal. Edouard was flagged marginally offside when racing clear to beat Mark Flekken, and Brentford made that fortune count when Wissa bundled in after Dean Henderson had parried Collins' scuffed effort. Flekken made a late stop to keep out Eze's deflected strike as Palace desperately pushed for another equaliser, but those efforts were fruitless. No Toney, no problem
There would have been plenty of concern among Brentford's supporters as they filtered into the Gtech Community Stadium, reeling from the news that star striker Toney had been left out of the matchday squad. And with record signing Igor Thiago unlikely to make his debut until late 2024 after suffering a meniscus injury in pre-season, the Bees were left without an attacking focal point. That did not seem to affect them, however, as their fluid front three of Wissa, Mbeumo and Kevin Schade pulled Palace's backline apart time and again in the latter stages of the first half. Wissa - himself a reported target for Wolverhampton Wanderers - and Mbeumo combined beautifully for the latter's opener, and though Palace enjoyed a strong spell to start the second half, Wissa was in the right place at the right time to restore Brentford's lead at a crucial point in the match. If Brentford must face the prospect of life without Toney, who is their all-time leading Premier League scorer with 36 goals, they can take heart from Wissa and Mbeumo stepping up when their team needed them most. The Bees will likely need that form to continue when they visit Liverpool next week. That optimism remained intact despite the sale of Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and persistent speculation over the future of Marc Guehi who, unlike Toney, played the full 90 minutes amid reported interest from Newcastle United. The England international did not enjoy his finest performance, arguably being slow to engage Mbeumo as the Brentford winger bustled into the area to open the scoring. While the early stages of the second half saw Palace up the ante with Eze and Adam Wharton, who drew solid saves out of Flekken, both increasingly influential, the guile of Olise and the power of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was withdrawn at half-time after representing France at the Olympic Games - was sorely missed.

Palace were denied a stunning opener after 26 minutes. Standing over a free-kick out on the right wing, Eze curled a sumptuous effort in off the near post. Increased Palace pressure paid off after 56 minutes, though - Pinnock turning into his own net after Daniel Munoz had headed across the face of goal. Flekken made a late stop to keep out Eze's deflected strike as Palace desperately pushed for another equaliser, but those efforts were fruitless. That did not seem to affect them, however, as their fluid front three of Wissa, Mbeumo and Kevin Schade pulled Palace's backline apart time and again in the latter stages of the first half. Wissa - himself a reported target for Wolverhampton Wanderers - and Mbeumo combined beautifully for the latter's opener, and though Palace enjoyed a strong spell to start the second half, Wissa was in the right place at the right time to restore Brentford's lead at a crucial point in the match. Tough start to Glasner's second act
Palace's stunning end to last season led many to tip them as outsiders for a European place, with Oliver Glasner's Eagles having won six of their final seven league matches in 2023/24. That optimism remained intact despite the sale of Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and persistent speculation over the future of Marc Guehi who, unlike Toney, played the full 90 minutes amid reported interest from Newcastle United. While the early stages of the second half saw Palace up the ante with Eze and Adam Wharton, who drew solid saves out of Flekken, both increasingly influential, the guile of Olise and the power of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was withdrawn at half-time after representing France at the Olympic Games - was sorely missed. All in all, the result represents a reality check for Glasner's side, who must regroup for a pair of London derbies against West Ham United and Chelsea before the season's first international break.

132,132,nottingham-forest,2025-04-12,"Abdoulaye Doucoure was Everton’s stoppage-time hero as they dented Nottingham Forest’s European hopes with a last-gasp 1-0 win at the City Ground. Nuno Espirito Santo was hoping his side would bounce back following their loss to Aston Villa last weekend, but Everton snatched the points in the final moments on Saturday. From their own attacking set-piece, Forest were caught on the counter, with substitute Dwight McNeil feeding Doucoure, who set himself for a cool finish over Matz Sels. Victory moves Everton onto 38 points in 14th – 18 clear of the bottom three – while Forest are just two points above Manchester City and three clear of fifth-place Aston Villa, in what is shaping up to be a thrilling race for UEFA Champions League qualification. The Argentine played a part in what might have been a key moment when he passed into Beto, who tumbled under Murillo’s challenge, but the referee’s on-field decision of no penalty was confirmed following a VAR review. After Everton cleared a corner, McNeil cleverly dispossessed Murillo before driving clear to lay it on for Doucoure, who made no mistake with a fantastic first-time finish. Forest stumble again
With the race for the Premier League top five in full swing, Nuno’s side still find themselves in pole position to secure qualify for the Champions League, but two losses on the bounce will have done nothing to ease any nerves. Nuno was able to welcome back Chris Wood from injury, but Anthony Elanga was only fit enough for the bench, and Forest lacked their usual zip in a sluggish performance, even after the latter was introduced in the second half. Nonetheless, Forest have a relatively kind run-in waiting them, with just one game against a current top-half side – when Chelsea visit the City Ground on the final matchday of the season – meaning that Nuno’s team should still fancy their chances of returning to Europe’s top table for the first time over four decades. Moyes would have had plenty of reason to be optimistic ahead of Saturday’s clash, with Everton having won three of their last four away league games against Forest, although his team had not won since overcoming Crystal Palace back in February. Everton have only lost two league matches under Moyes, though, and their resilience was on show throughout, even if it at times they defended rather aggressively – Jarrad Branthwaite’s cynical off-ball push on Jota Silva in the 13th minute saw him escape a booking, though he earned one in the 39th minute for another shove on the Forest winger.

Nuno Espirito Santo was hoping his side would bounce back following their loss to Aston Villa last weekend, but Everton snatched the points in the final moments on Saturday. Everton were arguably the better team throughout, though they seemed destined for a draw until a stunning 94th-minute breakaway from the Toffees. From their own attacking set-piece, Forest were caught on the counter, with substitute Dwight McNeil feeding Doucoure, who set himself for a cool finish over Matz Sels. Victory moves Everton onto 38 points in 14th – 18 clear of the bottom three – while Forest are just two points above Manchester City and three clear of fifth-place Aston Villa, in what is shaping up to be a thrilling race for UEFA Champions League qualification. How the match unfolded
Everton started positively, highlighted by some neat touches from Armando Broja on his first start under David Moyes, though there was little goalmouth action until James Garner drilled a shot at Sels in the 25th minute. The hosts struggled to hit top gear, though Callum Hudson-Odoi did force a smart stop from Jordan Pickford just before half-time. Hudson-Odoi should have done better when he dragged a tame attempt straight at Pickford just after the restart, with Iliman Ndiaye then failing to beat Sels after latching onto James Tarkowski’s inch-perfect pass at the other end. Jack Harrison lashed over as Everton built up momentum, with substitute Carlos Alcaraz adding some extra guile. After Everton cleared a corner, McNeil cleverly dispossessed Murillo before driving clear to lay it on for Doucoure, who made no mistake with a fantastic first-time finish. Toffees get over sticky patch
The second David Moyes era at Everton has been a huge success so far, with the Scotsman having impressively pulled the Toffees up from relegation candidates to comfortable mid-table dwellers since rejoining the club in January. Moyes would have had plenty of reason to be optimistic ahead of Saturday’s clash, with Everton having won three of their last four away league games against Forest, although his team had not won since overcoming Crystal Palace back in February. Everton have only lost two league matches under Moyes, though, and their resilience was on show throughout, even if it at times they defended rather aggressively – Jarrad Branthwaite’s cynical off-ball push on Jota Silva in the 13th minute saw him escape a booking, though he earned one in the 39th minute for another shove on the Forest winger. Harrison, meanwhile, worked hard down the right flank and put in several dangerous crosses before he eventually made way for McNeil, who – just four minutes after coming on – showed great drive and composure to lead a flying counter and pick out Doucoure with an excellently weighted pass. Everton can have another big say in the top five race in their next two outings, as they host Manchester City before taking on Chelsea. Club reports

134,134,leicester-city,2024-08-19,"Jamie Vardy made Tottenham Hotspur pay for their wastefulness as Leicester City started the Steve Cooper era by battling to a 1-1 draw on their Premier League return. Ex-Leicester man James Maddison set up Pedro Porro to head home the opener in Monday's match, which Ange Postecoglou's visitors dominated for large periods. But 37-year-old veteran Vardy, whom Cooper had ruled out with an injury only a few days before, scored a ninth career Premier League goal against Spurs to delight the home supporters. How the match unfolded
Leicester had already resisted a wave of Spurs attacks when Maddison's clipped ball was flicked into the bottom-right corner by Porro after 29 minutes. Solanke and Bentancur were then thwarted by Mads Hermansen and Spurs' wastefulness was punished when Abdul Fatawu's dink from the right side of the area was nodded in at the back post by Vardy just before the hour-mark. It could have got even better for Vardy and Leicester as he was played through on goal, but Guglielmo Vicario made a fantastic save. Bentancur was helped from the field on a stretcher after clashing heads with Fatawu, causing a lengthy delay. Evergreen Vardy still the man for Leicester
Leicester paid an emotional tribute to former manager and assistant Craig Shakespeare, who passed away earlier this month, before kick-off. Nigel Pearson – the last man before Enzo Maresco to get the Foxes promoted to the Premier League – was in attendance to pay tribute to his great friend. Maresca's departure for Chelsea in June means Cooper is the new man in the dugout, and the former Nottingham Forest boss will be all too aware of the challenges facing Leicester this season. Indeed, on a different day the Foxes could have been out of it by half-time, with Bentancur denied on the line by Wilfred Ndidi and Hermansen thwarting Johnson and Solanke, before Richarlison fluffed his lines. But Vardy, even at the age of 37, remains a talisman for the Foxes and he was in the right place at the right time to score a ninth career Premier League goal against Spurs in the 57th minute. Incredibly, Vardy – part of Leicester's famous title triumph in the 2015/16 campaign – nearly found a winner, only for Vicario to deny him. Maddison impresses on return but isn't rewarded
Maddison was once a hugely popular figure at Leicester but he was met with a mixture of audible boos and some applause on his first return to the King Power Stadium since departing in June 2023. New boy Solanke, signed in a reported £65million deal from AFC Bournemouth earlier this month, was lively but missed a big chance when he shot straight at Hermansen shortly before Vardy's equaliser.

But 37-year-old veteran Vardy, whom Cooper had ruled out with an injury only a few days before, scored a ninth career Premier League goal against Spurs to delight the home supporters. Spurs, who lost Rodrigo Bentancur to a head injury that caused a lengthy stoppage in the second half, were left to rue a series of missed opportunities, with debutant Dominic Solanke, Brennan Johnson and Richarlison all culpable. How the match unfolded
Leicester had already resisted a wave of Spurs attacks when Maddison's clipped ball was flicked into the bottom-right corner by Porro after 29 minutes. Shortly afterwards, another great Maddison delivery was volleyed wide of the left-hand post by Johnson, who should have done better after ghosting in unmarked at the back post. Solanke and Bentancur were then thwarted by Mads Hermansen and Spurs' wastefulness was punished when Abdul Fatawu's dink from the right side of the area was nodded in at the back post by Vardy just before the hour-mark. In the last of nine minutes of stoppage time, Richarlison missed a gilt-edged chance, heading wide from close range after a fabulous free-kick from fellow substitute and teenage debutant Lucas Bergvall as the spoils were shared. Nigel Pearson – the last man before Enzo Maresco to get the Foxes promoted to the Premier League – was in attendance to pay tribute to his great friend. Maresca's departure for Chelsea in June means Cooper is the new man in the dugout, and the former Nottingham Forest boss will be all too aware of the challenges facing Leicester this season.

Maddison impresses on return but isn't rewarded
Maddison was once a hugely popular figure at Leicester but he was met with a mixture of audible boos and some applause on his first return to the King Power Stadium since departing in June 2023. The attacking midfielder, no doubt keen to remind people of his quality after missing out on UEFA EURO 2024 with England, was at the heart of everything good about TSpurs' play until being replaced in the 79th minute. He set the tempo, displayed his wide array of passing ability and provided an excellent assist for Porro. Another for Johnson should have arrived shortly after. But Maddison's efforts proved in vain as Spurs were punished for their profligacy. Spurs missed out on UEFA Champions League football by only two points last season, and if they are to make the jump to the top four this campaign, Postecoglou will want to see a much more clinical edge from his team.

They are one point behind Manchester City and three behind Nottingham Forest following their loss to Everton, while Southampton remain 20th. How the match unfolded
Jan Bednarek made an excellent block in the opening minute to deny Marcus Rashford, but Southampton had the clearest opening of the early exchanges as Emiliano Martinez clawed Cameron Archer’s effort away from a tight angle. Villa threatened at the other end as Ramsdale charged out to deny Youri Tielemans from close range after Asensio’s cross had created problems inside the Southampton penalty area. The visitors needed the impact of Watkins to make their dominance count though, and just two minutes after coming on, he was brought down by Bednarek after racing on to Morgan Rogers’ through-ball. Southampton’s goalkeeper was beaten again when Malen peeled away down the right side of the box and struck firmly low into the far corner. Familiar errors plague Saints
Last week’s 3-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur finally sealed Southampton’s fate, as relegation to the Championship was confirmed with seven matches remaining. Southampton resorted to a low block in the first 45 minutes, which left little to no space for Villa to exploit in their attempts to get in behind, while also allowing the Premier League’s bottom club to feel their way into the match. Bednarek was the wrong side of Watkins when he slid in, and though Ramsdale saved the resulting penalty, Southampton were notably rattled after it had been awarded, leading to two quickfire goals. Even at 2-0 down, they did still attempt to offer a threat, with Martinez making a low save to deny Matheus Fernandes late on, but it was too little, too late, and McGinn added further gloss for Villa shortly after. Next up for Southampton are West Ham United. The double substitution of Watkins and Malen jolted Villa to life, with the former causing havoc among Southampton’s defenders by running in behind, with Rogers and Tielemans possessing the quality to find him.

Three substitutes flipped the game on its head, with Ollie Watkins, Donyell Malen and John McGinn getting the goals at St Mary’s. Watkins scored the opener in the 73rd minute, moments after he had won a penalty that Marco Asensio took but was saved by Ramsdale. Malen doubled Villa’s lead six minutes later, before Ramsdale then kept out another Asensio spot-kick, only for McGinn to score on the rebound. Villa move up to fifth in the Premier League, which will be enough for Champions League qualification this season. How the match unfolded

Ramsdale pushed away Asensio’s effort, yet he was picking the ball out of his net moments later when Watkins brilliantly flicked home from Tielemans’ looping pass. There was another gift to come for Villa in stoppage time – McGinn was clipped just inside the box, and although Ramsdale denied Asensio from 12 yards once more, the Scotl reacted quickest to fire in a third for Unai Emery’s team. Southampton resorted to a low block in the first 45 minutes, which left little to no space for Villa to exploit in their attempts to get in behind, while also allowing the Premier League’s bottom club to feel their way into the match. They started the second half in a similar fashion even as the game became more stretched, but eventually Villa’s continued pressure became too much. Bednarek was the wrong side of Watkins when he slid in, and though Ramsdale saved the resulting penalty, Southampton were notably rattled after it had been awarded, leading to two quickfire goals. Even at 2-0 down, they did still attempt to offer a threat, with Martinez making a low save to deny Matheus Fernandes late on, but it was too little, too late, and McGinn added further gloss for Villa shortly after. Villa show strength in depth
Wednesday’s 3-1 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-finals took a lot out of Emery’s side physically, with the Spaniard opting to make four changes on Saturday. That could explain the stale start, with Villa mostly controlling possession but struggling to fashion many clear-cut chances. They were mostly restricted to shots from long range for the first 60 minutes of the match, with only Tielemans and Amadou Onana forcing serious work from Ramsdale. The double substitution of Watkins and Malen jolted Villa to life, with the former causing havoc among Southampton’s defenders by running in behind, with Rogers and Tielemans possessing the quality to find him. McGinn had a similar impact after his 85th-minute introduction, as he ensured Villa wrapped up the points with a more convincing scoreline after Asensio’s off-day from the spot. Villa now gear up for the crucial second leg against PSG at Villa Park, with fellow top-five challengers Newcastle United their next Premier League opponents, with so much still to play for.

Arsenal join Manchester City and Brighton & Hove Albion at the top with six points from their first two games, while Aston Villa are down in 12th. How the match unfolded
A cagey opening burst into life when Bukayo Saka registered the encounter's first meaningful attempt on target, striking from the edge of the area to force Emiliano Martinez into a smart save. Moments after going down with an injury, Leon Bailey sprung to his feet to force Gabriel Magalhaes into a mistake, allowing Morgan Rogers to play in Watkins, who uncharacteristically scuffed his effort wide. Villa thought they had taken the lead eight minutes after the restart when Amadou Onana’s effort deflected onto the crossbar, with the rebound falling for Watkins to head home, only for Raya to spring back up to save brilliantly. But against the run of play, Villa were caught out, as Trossard struck low into the bottom corner with the Gunners’ first attempt of the second period. Partey concluded the scoring in the 77th minute, curling an effort in at Martinez’s near post, although the Villa goalkeeper may feel he should have done better. Dynamic Villa lacking a clinical edge
After scoring 76 goals in the Premier League last season, Villa have so far failed to replicate the clinical showing that secured them their top-four finish. Emery’s side have managed just six shots on target from their 25 attempts in their two matches so far, but it was not through a lack of trying as they were denied by a combination of poor finishing and an inspired goalkeeping display. Watkins was tipped to challenge Man City’s Erling Haaland for the Premier League Golden Boot after an impressive showing at UEFA EURO 2024 but failed to find the net with the two golden opportunities presented to him. And despite the introductions of Jacob Ramsey and Jhon Duran, Villa struggled against last season's sternest defence, failing to take advantage of their impressive first-half showing. Rogers’ energetic display was a notable standout for the home side as he continues to make his mark under Emery’s guidance. Arteta overcomes Emery hoodoo
After seeing last season's title charge derailed by Emery’s side, when they lost 2-0 at Emirates Stadium in April, Arteta exempted revenge on his recent foes with a stylish, yet combative, display that highlighted their Premier League credentials this time around. A stop-start opening to the match threatened to restrict the Gunners’ attacking momentum, and had it not been for Villa’s wastefulness, they could have found themselves coming from a goal behind at Villa Park. The tide shifted towards the interval as Arsenal’s intricate passing failed to penetrate Villa’s stern rearguard, with Rogers proving to be a particular thorn in their side. However, Arteta’s side did not divert from the possession style of play that has brought them success in the division over the past two seasons, evident with Saka’s 63rd-minute effort after being found by Odegaard, only for Martinez to stand in his way.

140,140,fulham,2024-09-14,"Danny Ings’ second-half stoppage time strike rescued a point for West Ham as they drew 1-1 with Fulham at Craven Cottage. Marco Silva’s side went ahead in the 24th minute when Jimenez arrived at the near post to turn home Emile Smith Rowe’s low centre. The hosts looked set to collect all three points until the fifth minute of stoppage time, when substitute Ings controlled Jarrod Bowen’s cross and drilled past Bernd Leno. A point apiece sees Fulham move up a place to 11th, while West Ham drop one to 14th. How the match unfolded
Fulham should have gone in front in the 23rd minute, but Adama Traore headed Alex Iwobi's inviting cross wide from six yards out. Smith Rowe beat the offside trap to latch onto Andreas Pereira's through-ball, before crossing for Jimenez to tuck away. The visitors went close to equalising on the hour mark when Bowen brilliantly controlled Mohammed Kudus' cross, but was thwarted by Leno's smart reflex save. However, there was to be a late twist as Ings took Bowen’s low centre into his stride, before Leno could only help the fierce drive into the net. Fulham still generated one final opportunity in the dying seconds when Calvin Bassey headed a free-kick wide, but both teams had to settle for a share of the spoils. Jimenez strikes against West Ham yet again
After naming an unchanged starting XI in each of Fulham's opening three games, Silva included Joachim Andersen for the first time since he signed from Crystal Palace. Bolstering the backline almost helped the Cottagers claim their first clean sheet of the campaign. Only Arsenal and Chelsea collected more points in top-flight London derbies than Fulham last season, but they would have to settle for just one today after Ings’ last-gasp exploits. They lost three of their four such matches last season, and that trend looked set to continue as they failed to register a shot on target during the first half at Craven Cottage. Club reports

The hosts looked set to collect all three points until the fifth minute of stoppage time, when substitute Ings controlled Jarrod Bowen’s cross and drilled past Bernd Leno. A point apiece sees Fulham move up a place to 11th, while West Ham drop one to 14th. Julen Lopetegui introduced Lucas Paqueta and Crysencio Summerville at half-time in a bid to sharpen West Ham's attacking threat. The visitors went close to equalising on the hour mark when Bowen brilliantly controlled Mohammed Kudus' cross, but was thwarted by Leno's smart reflex save. Paqueta fired narrowly over from distance soon after as West Ham continued their search for an equaliser. Kenny Tete volleyed wide of the target at the other end, while Traore headed just over from a Tom Cairney cross, before Reiss Nelson shot straight at Alphonse Areola. However, there was to be a late twist as Ings took Bowen’s low centre into his stride, before Leno could only help the fierce drive into the net. Jimenez strikes against West Ham yet again
After naming an unchanged starting XI in each of Fulham's opening three games, Silva included Joachim Andersen for the first time since he signed from Crystal Palace. The Mexican was in the right place at the right time to steer home his sixth Premier League goal against West Ham - the most he has recorded against any opponent in the competition. Ings rescues Hammers
West Ham have been slow out of the blocks following international breaks in recent times. But Lopetegui’s alterations appeared to rejuvenate the visitors, who looked a lot brighter going forward during the second half with Bowen going close to finding an equaliser. Bowen did brilliantly to keep the ball in play and send in a low cross towards the striker, who delivered when it mattered to prevent a third defeat in four games. That will give West Ham momentum with more games of local interest on the horizon. Their next two see them welcome Chelsea to London Stadium before travelling to Brentford the following weekend.

142,142,manchester-city,2024-08-24,"Erling Haaland scored a hat-trick as Manchester City earned a resounding 4-1 triumph over Ipswich Town thanks largely to a barnstorming first-half blitz at the Etihad Stadium. But Haaland levelled from the spot just five minutes later and, after Kevin De Bruyne capitalised on Arijanet Muric's error, the striker had Pep Guardiola's men 3-1 in front with only 16 minutes on the clock. Haaland ensured he would take home the match ball by lashing in Man City’s fourth in the closing stages but the damage was already done by that devastating four-minute goal spree. City have now made it two wins from two, while Ipswich will hope to get off the mark against Fulham next weekend. Szmodics squeezing in the opener soon seemed a distant memory as City shellshocked the visitors. Haaland coolly converted the leveller from the spot after Leif Davis felled Savinho and the tricky winger harassed Muric into an error for De Bruyne to roll into an unguarded goal. De Bruyne then turned provider with an over-the-top ball that Haaland nodded past Muric and side-footed home. Rico Lewis and De Bruyne both hammered the crossbar and City's No 9 volleyed over in search of a hat-trick. Muric went some way to atoning for his earlier errors to prevent Haaland's thumping header from finding the top corner just after the hour. But there was little he could do when Haaland celebrated a seventh career Premier League hat-trick with an excellent low drive into the bottom-right corner from 20 yards in the 88th minute. Haaland the hat-trick hero as Savinho looks a big-time player
The fact Haaland loves to score goals is unlikely to make headline news but, while this might be only his third season, his standing as one of the all-time great Premier League strikers is indisputable already. He was as clinical as ever to help City quickly recover from the early setback and his third goal was an effort of the absolute highest order in another display of lethal finishing. Haaland was given a standing ovation when he exited late on, a reception only matched by the appearance of returning hero Ilkay Gundogan in the 71st minute. Aside from Haaland, De Bruyne was at his mercurial best, while Mateo Kovacic knitted things together masterfully in midfield before an untimely injury early in the second half. The 20-year-old Brazilian was a constant menace and it was he who drew the foul that helped City restore parity after the early setback. Harsh lessons for Ipswich
This fixture represented Ipswich's first visit to the Etihad and, like countless sides before them, they learned very quickly just how tough an assignment it is against this breathless City side. But the time it took the ball to trickle over the line felt longer than the time it took City to race into the lead, with Ipswich barely able to catch their breath. Muric, a former City player, dithered for far too long to gift the hosts their second and you wonder whether he might have been better standing his ground for the third, too. Club reports

Sam Szmodics sparked jubilant scenes in the away end on Saturday as Ipswich stole a surprise seventh-minute lead with a brilliant counter-attack. City have now made it two wins from two, while Ipswich will hope to get off the mark against Fulham next weekend. Harsh lessons for Ipswich
This fixture represented Ipswich's first visit to the Etihad and, like countless sides before them, they learned very quickly just how tough an assignment it is against this breathless City side. Kieran McKenna has earned a reputation as a brave, front-foot head coach and that yielded rewards when Szmodics – making a first Premier League start – raced onto Ben Johnson's excellent pass and prodded through the legs of Ederson. But the time it took the ball to trickle over the line felt longer than the time it took City to race into the lead, with Ipswich barely able to catch their breath. Much like in last week's opening-weekend loss to Liverpool, there were moments of encouragement for Ipswich – who saw claims for a penalty denied when Davis went down under Savinho's challenge before the break – but ultimately they remain without a point and under no illusions about the size of the task facing them.

144,144,arsenal,2025-04-12,"Yoane Wissa cancelled out Thomas Partey's goal as Brentford salvaged a 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, pushing Liverpool closer to the Premier League title. Four days after beating Real Madrid 3-0 in the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal needed over an hour to break down Thomas Frank's stubborn visitors. Partey finished across Mark Flekken after the Gunners' midweek hero Declan Rice led a devastating counter-attack following a Brentford corner. But Wissa swivelled in a crowded penalty area to hook past former Brentford goalkeeper David Raya, and despite Mikel Arteta bringing Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard off the bench, Arsenal – who finished with 10 men due to an injury to Jorginho – were unable to find a winner. A second successive league draw for Arsenal means Liverpool need just nine more points to secure the title, and could be crowned champions next weekend. How the match unfolded
Brentford made an assured start, though Arsenal carved out the first half-chance when Gabriel Martinelli's dink was smothered by Flekken. Kristoffer Ajer worked former team-mate Raya, then Arsenal had a potential opener chalked off following a VAR review. Arsenal's first shot on target did not arrive until the 41st minute, when Flekken turned Rice's drive away, then the visiting goalkeeper produced a better save from Leandro Trossard's 20-yard effort. But the Gunners went ahead through a brilliant counter-attacking goal in the 61st minute. Raya fed Rice after claiming a Bryan Mbeumo corner, and the midfielder drove forward before teeing up Partey for a thumping finish. Arsenal finished with 10 men as Jorginho hobbled off injured after they had used all their substitutions, and Saka curled wide as their search for a winner proved fruitless. Arsenal cutting corners
With the title race nearing its completion and a 3-0 aggregate lead to protect against Madrid, Arsenal were widely expected to make changes for this match. And with Saka and Odegaard starting on the bench, the Gunners struggled to create from open play. Arsenal had 10 corners in the first half alone, twice as many as they had won in the first 45 minutes of any other game this campaign. But without the imposing figure of Gabriel Magalhaes to aim for, Arsenal failed to make those situations count. After gathering Mbeumo's delivery, Raya showed great awareness to bowl the ball out to Rice, who carried it from the edge of one penalty area to the other for his assist. But after half clearing another Mbeumo set-piece, Arsenal were slow to get out and were promptly punished. Arteta's focus will be on ensuring Arsenal navigate the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final, but he will also be keen to keep Liverpool honest in the coming weeks. After Wednesday's trip to Madrid, the Gunners go to Ipswich Town on 20 April. Brentford on the right lines
Brentford arrived at the Emirates having won five of their last six away Premier League matches, and that form translated into a confident start as they moved the ball well. The Norwegian then showed his worth at the other end, denying Martinelli with a courageous block. It was his intelligent run and hanging cross that led to Wissa's equaliser, while he also made a potentially goal-saving challenge to deny Saka almost straight from the restart. Arteta felt Brentford could have been reduced to 10 men in the first half as Christian Norgaard chopped Martinelli down with a scissor-like challenge, but referee Simon Hooper and the VAR deemed the foul was only worthy of a yellow card. Ultimately, Arsenal could have no complaints at Brentford taking a deserved point. After back-to-back draws against two of the league’s top-five teams in the form of the Gunners and Chelsea, Frank's side host Brighton & Hove Albion next. Club reports

Michael Kayode's dinked cross was headed back across goal by Nathan Collins, and Wissa improvised brilliantly to finish on the turn. This match featured two teams known for their set-piece prowess, and Brentford were certainly tested from dead balls. They did, however, catch Brentford cold from a corner at the other end. After gathering Mbeumo's delivery, Raya showed great awareness to bowl the ball out to Rice, who carried it from the edge of one penalty area to the other for his assist. But after half clearing another Mbeumo set-piece, Arsenal were slow to get out and were promptly punished. They were physically outmatched as Collins kept the ball alive, and Raya was left flapping at Wissa's finish. Brentford on the right lines

Mateta dragged Palace back into the match with his first goal moments later, but Leicester looked set to hang on despite being put under heavy pressure in the second half. However, Conor Coady fouled Ismaila Sarr in the box and Mateta coolly dispatched his penalty kick to deny Steve Cooper a first league victory as Leicester manager. Palace’s first real opportunity nearly resulted in them going in front, but Wout Faes made a heroic block to deny Mateta. Selhurst Park was then stunned into silence just 23 seconds into the second half as Leicester doubled their lead – Mavididi took advantage of some slack defending to finish from close range. Palace found a way back into the encounter after Mateta applied a simple finish to Tyrick Mitchell’s excellent cross. Coady’s moment of carelessness in fouling Sarr denied the Foxes a point, as Mateta rescued Palace at the death with a confident penalty kick. Palace still without elusive win
Oliver Glasner may have pinpointed this fixture as the perfect time to kickstart Palace’s campaign, with the transfer window closed and the future of the likes of Marc Guehi resolved, but it was not to be. Eze was his usual buzzy self, and at the heart of most Palace attacks, while Mateta showed his true quality with his two finishes to ensure his side would not lose three of their first four league matches. Glasner’s side must now regroup in time for next Saturday, when they face Manchester United at home. He showed great maturity in passing to Mavididi, who was unmarked for the second goal, while his attacking runs stretched Palace’s backline. The Foxes will still be disappointed at not walking away with all three points, having been two goals up, but spending most of the latter stages in their own half was always going to lead to Palace creating opportunities.

However, Conor Coady fouled Ismaila Sarr in the box and Mateta coolly dispatched his penalty kick to deny Steve Cooper a first league victory as Leicester manager. How the match unfolded
Jordan Ayew came close to haunting his old side in the opening minutes but squandered a great opportunity, shanking a volley over the bar from close range after good work from Wilfred Ndidi. Moments later, Leicester took the lead, with Vardy knocking it past Dean Henderson to slot in his second goal of the season. Selhurst Park was then stunned into silence just 23 seconds into the second half as Leicester doubled their lead – Mavididi took advantage of some slack defending to finish from close range. Coady’s moment of carelessness in fouling Sarr denied the Foxes a point, as Mateta rescued Palace at the death with a confident penalty kick. There were defensive errors though especially in the first half, with the likes of Guehi guilty of some lapses in concentration, while Nathaniel Clyne’s botched clearance gifted Leicester their second goal right at the start of the second half. Ndidi shines but Foxes leave disappointed
Cooper will be pleased with certain aspects of his side’s performance, albeit not with the result, with Ndidi being at the centre of many positive aspects. The Nigerian picked up two assists and seemed to enjoy the extra freedom he was given in a slightly more advanced role ahead of the tenacious duo of Harry Winks and Oliver Skipp. He showed great maturity in passing to Mavididi, who was unmarked for the second goal, while his attacking runs stretched Palace’s backline.

148,148,fulham,2024-08-24,"Emile Smith Rowe and Alex Iwobi grabbed the goals to secure a 2-1 win for Fulham over Leicester City at Craven Cottage. Iwobi’s goal 20 minutes from time on Saturday saw Marco Silva’s team clinch their first victory of the 2024-25 Premier League season. Another former Arsenal player – Smith Rowe, a summer signing from the Gunners – opened his Fulham account when he broke the deadlock in the 18th minute. Wout Faes headed home an equaliser before half-time, but the hosts’ dominance ultimately paid off when Iwobi raced through to finish underneath Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Leicester have one point from their opening two games, and sit 14th, three places behind Fulham in the early standings. How the match unfolded
It was a fast start from Fulham with Hermansen forced to push wide Adama Traore’s left-footed strike before collecting Iwobi’s low shot inside the opening 10 minutes. And Fulham were rewarded for their positive play when Traore led a swift attack and found Smith Rowe in space. Despite the hosts’ impressive first-half showing, though, Leicester were able to draw level before the interval when Faes rose highest from a corner to head past Bernd Leno. But Fulham continued to dominate proceedings following the restart and after missed chances from Rodrigo Muniz and Kenny Tete, Iwobi made no such mistake. Antonee Robinson’s pass found Iwobi in-behind the Leicester defence, and he cooly squeezed the ball beyond Hermansen for the winner. Smith Rowe makes his mark
Despite an opening day defeat at Manchester United, Silva decided to name an unchanged starting line-up. Smith Rowe has arrived from Arsenal with lots of promise and the home faithful will have been delighted to have seen him get off the mark so early in his Fulham career. A lack of cutting edge from then on in may concern Silva, but Iwobi ultimately came up with the goods. The Cottagers have recruited well following the departures of some key players, and should be looking for more than just mid-table and safety this term. Despite being indebted to their goalkeeper and determined defending, with only Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s long-range effort testing Leno in Fulham’s goal, the Foxes stunned Craven Cottage with a surprise equaliser before half-time. Vardy, at 37, was again tasked with leading the line but had few opportunities to test Leno as the Foxes failed to create chances all afternoon. Club reports

Despite the hosts’ impressive first-half showing, though, Leicester were able to draw level before the interval when Faes rose highest from a corner to head past Bernd Leno. Antonee Robinson’s pass found Iwobi in-behind the Leicester defence, and he cooly squeezed the ball beyond Hermansen for the winner. Foxes come unstuck
Manager Steve Cooper also decided to keep trust in the same XI that held Tottenham to a draw on the opening weekend of the season meaning his new signings, Jordan Ayew and Oliver Skipp, also had to settle for places on the bench. Despite being indebted to their goalkeeper and determined defending, with only Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s long-range effort testing Leno in Fulham’s goal, the Foxes stunned Craven Cottage with a surprise equaliser before half-time. Jamie Vardy was in an offside position but after a VAR review, the referee decided the striker was not interfering with play and the goal was allowed to stand. Vardy, at 37, was again tasked with leading the line but had few opportunities to test Leno as the Foxes failed to create chances all afternoon. The introduction of Ayew with half-an-hour remaining couldn’t change their attacking fortunes as Leicester suffered their first defeat since arriving back into the Premier League. Club reports

Former Leicester winger Harvey Barnes added a third as the Foxes became the first English team to lose eight successive home matches without scoring a goal. While Newcastle with one game in hand, go one point clear of Manchester City and are only behind Chelsea on goal difference, Leicester stay 15 points adrift of 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers, with only 21 points to play for. How the match unfolded
Jamie Vardy worked Nick Pope after just 10 seconds, but Newcastle hit the front in the second minute when Tino Livramento crossed for the unmarked Murphy to convert. Schar spotted Mads Hermansen off his line and hit the crossbar with an audacious shot from beyond the halfway line, but Murphy collected the loose ball and poked home. Newcastle sliced through Leicester with ease as Alexander Isak shot wide, and they had their third goal in the 34th minute, Barnes tapping in after Hermansen parried Joelinton's effort. A Patson Daka shot struck both posts and bounced back to Pope amid a suspicion of offside against Vardy late in the first half, in Leicester's best opening of the game. Newcastle's tempo dropped after half-time, but Hermansen almost gifted them a fourth goal when he passed straight to Schar, immediately atoning by parrying the defender's shot. Leicester had something to celebrate when 15-year-old Jeremy Monga came on for his Premier League debut, but they failed to score once again as Wout Faes sent a late header wide. Leicester sinking without trace
Ruud van Nistelrooy had promised Leicester would fight until the end ahead of this match, but fight was in short supply from them here, at least when defending. It was a similar story for the third goal, with Leicester's backline slow to react to Hermansen's parry. Leicester attempted to offer some consolation in attack, but things would not fall for them. Daka had their best effort as the flag went up against Vardy, and replays suggested that tight call might have been subject to a VAR check, had Daka found the net. Leicester's brightest moment came when Monga was introduced, becoming the second-youngest player to appear in the Premier League, after Ethan Nwaneri on his 2022 debut. But that was as good as it got as Leicester became the first team in Football League history to lose eight successive home league matches without scoring. One day after Southampton's relegation was confirmed, Leicester are not far behind them. Club reports

Newcastle's tempo dropped after half-time, but Hermansen almost gifted them a fourth goal when he passed straight to Schar, immediately atoning by parrying the defender's shot. Momentum with Magpies
If anyone believed Newcastle would relax following their EFL Cup triumph, they might want to think again. Slip-ups from Nottingham Forest, Chelsea and Manchester City gave Eddie Howe's men a chance to seize the initiative in the Champions League race, and they grasped it with both hands. This victory was all about Newcastle's wingers. A three-match ban and a thigh injury have combined to keep Anthony Gordon out since early March, but the Magpies have barely missed him, thanks to the form of Barnes. He showed good awareness in the lead-up to the opener, waiting for Livramento to create an overload before slipping him through. And when the home defenders were on their heels from Joelinton's parried effort, Barnes was alert enough to stab in the rebound. Murphy, meanwhile, showed the predatory instincts that have made this the best season of his career. Since 7 December, only Mohamed Salah (23) and Isak (17) have bettered his 14 goal involvements in the Premier League. Fifth place could be enough for Champions League qualification, but Newcastle will aim even higher. Club reports

There was nothing to separate the teams in Sunday’s match at a sunny Gtech Community Stadium, though not for a lack of opportunities. Yoane Wissa went closest for the hosts, while Chelsea kept Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken busy before substitute Palmer curled just over at the end. The draw marks Brentford’s first home clean sheet in the Premier League this season – the Bees sit in 12th, a point back from Crystal Palace, but have not won at home in the league this year. In between, Keane Lewis-Potter and Bryan Mbeumo combined smartly down the left, the latter setting up Wissa, whose shot nestled into the side netting, while Mikkel Damsgaard spurned a big opportunity when he was put through one-on-one with Robert Sanchez. Nicolas Jackson shot wide early in the second half, and he then very nearly forced Sepp van den Berg to turn into his own net, but Flekken made a strong reflex save. The Blues came to life with the introduction of talisman Palmer and Pedro Neto, the latter twice testing Flekken, whose counterpart Sanchez then had to be alert to deny Mbeumo at the other end, with Van den Berg and Wissa heading off target. Home struggles roll on for Brentford
After Sandro Tonali’s stunner condemned Brentford to defeat in their midweek match at Newcastle United, Thomas Frank would have been hoping for a strong reaction in this derby. The Bees were, at times, clever and sharp, and they created plenty of decent openings, including big moments for Wissa and Damsgaard, who tripped when he was through on goal in the first half. Brentford have now gone eight Premier League matches without a win at the Gtech Community Stadium. Frank will undoubtedly be relieved that his side picked up their first home clean sheet of the season though, in no small part due to the tremendous efforts of Flekken. Brentford face Arsenal next in another London derby before they host Brighton & Hove Albion. That is one of just three league home matches remaining for Brentford this season and Frank will need to find a way to get his team to rediscover that winning formula on their own turf before the campaign is out, if they are to push for a top-half finish.

Chelsea, meanwhile, remain in fourth, one point ahead of Manchester City. How the match unfolded
The first half was bookended by two big openings for Chelsea, both crafted by Reece James, who crossed onto the heads of Christopher Nkunku and Tosin Adarabioyo, but neither could hit the target. Nicolas Jackson shot wide early in the second half, and he then very nearly forced Sepp van den Berg to turn into his own net, but Flekken made a strong reflex save. The Blues came to life with the introduction of talisman Palmer and Pedro Neto, the latter twice testing Flekken, whose counterpart Sanchez then had to be alert to deny Mbeumo at the other end, with Van den Berg and Wissa heading off target. Palmer nearly snatched all three points, but his brilliant strike just skimmed over. Blues away drought continues
Pre-match, Enzo Maresca acknowledged that managing fatigue would be crucial, with Chelsea returning to action after a short turnaround following their 1-0 victory against Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday. Maresca’s concerns proved valid, as his heavily rotated Chelsea side looked flat and uninspired for much of the first half. Away matches have been something of a stumbling block for the Blues in recent times. Their struggles eased significantly with substitutions in the second though, with Jackson, Palmer and Neto providing just the right kind of impetus for the visitors. Chelsea now turn their attention to the UEFA Conference League as they face Legia Warszawa in the first leg of their quarter-final tie before hosting Ipswich Town next weekend. He was called into action numerous times to keep out clever strikes from Jackson, Neto and James, as well as that great stop to spare Van den Berg’s blushes. Club reports

The Seagulls could not make their dominance count as Ipswich showed spirit and resilience to earn their first away point back in the Premier League on Saturday. Muric kept his side in the contest with a series of excellent saves to deny Brighton in a one-sided first half. Ipswich carried more of a counter-attacking threat after half-time, and Liam Delap nearly shocked the Amex Stadium when his strike hit the post following a powerful run. Brighton kept pushing for a breakthrough goal at the other end, but Ipswich held on and are have earned their second point of the season, with their hosts staying third behind Manchester City and Liverpool. Muric also kept out Danny Welbeck’s far-post header, before a sensational double-save further frustrated Brighton. Georginio Rutter’s curling effort was beaten away by Muric, whose quick reactions then denied Kaoru Mitoma on the rebound and kept the game goalless going into half-time. Brighton created further pressure as they sought a winner of their own, but Ipswich’s rear-guard action protected Muric more effectively than in the first half, and the visitors were rewarded with what could prove a valuable point come the end of the season. Seagulls grow frustrated
After such a positive start to the season, this was the first real hiccup for Premier League Manager of the Month Fabian Hurzeler. His Brighton side were scarcely threatened in a defensive sense in a dominant first half, but their territorial superiority could not be converted into a breakthrough goal – in large part due to Muric’s superb display. But as the second half wore on, Brighton must have feared they would be caught at the other end, perhaps fortunate one of a number of Ipswich breaks did not result in an unlikely away goal. Regardless, this will be seen as two points dropped for Brighton, who will have to prove they are capable of breaking down low blocks in these home matches against sides in the bottom half of the table if they are to challenge for a European place this season. Fighting Town hold on for point
This was a tough afternoon for Ipswich as from the first whistle they were pinned back by Brighton’s possession-based approach. Delap’s break did encourage Ipswich to push on in pursuit of a first win back in the Premier League, and Omari Hutchinson led another counter from a Brighton corner but shot straight at Bart Verbruggen.

Southampton are now the first team in Premier League history to start three separate campaigns with four straight defeats, having previously done so in 1998/99 and 2012/13.

United emerged from the first international break of 2024/25 14th in the Premier League table following defeats to Brighton and Liverpool, but they got back to winning ways after surviving an early scare on the south coast. Making his first Premier League start, Tyler Dibling won a penalty for Southampton in the first half, but Andre Onana kept out Cameron Archer's kick and the momentum shifted from there. De Ligt headed in his first United goal just two minutes later, then an excellent Rashford strike gave them breathing room. Garnacho added a third in stoppage time, having also drawn a red card for Southampton captain Jack Stephens. The win lifts United to eighth in the table with six points, while Southampton are 19th, having lost all four of their matches since winning promotion from the Championship. How the match unfolded
United were twice indebted to Onana for keeping them level in the first half, with the visiting goalkeeper diving to his right to keep out a curling effort from 18-year-old Dibling early on. The teenager continued to run United ragged down the Southampton right, with Diogo Dalot scything him down to give Saints a 33rd-minute penalty. Archer was unable to convert from the spot, though, seeing his weak effort pushed away by Onana. United swiftly punished Southampton for that miss. De Ligt headed Bruno Fernandes' floated cross home just two minutes after Onana's penalty save. The Red Devils had daylight shortly before half-time, with Rashford curling a tremendous shot against the far post and in after finding space on the edge of the area. Garnacho came off the bench to add to Southampton's woes in the second half, with Stephens' wild lunge on the Argentinian resulting in him being shown a straight red card with 11 minutes to play. Garnacho then got himself on the scoresheet six minutes into stoppage-time, lashing into the roof of the net after Dalot found him with a cutback from the byline. The 18-year-old tormented United's stand-in left-back Dalot, and was chopped down by his marker after one mazy run took him into the penalty area. But the match turned on Archer's failure to beat Onana from 12 yards, with some slack marking in the aftermath of a short corner allowing De Ligt to put United ahead just 149 seconds later. Rashford fashioned half a chance for himself and took it expertly. The hosts failed to register a single shot in the second half as United cruised to victory. Rashford magic lifts Red Devils
Erik ten Hag reacted to United's 3-0 defeat to Liverpool prior to the international break by making two changes to his starting lineup, with Garnacho and Casemiro – whose performance against the Reds was strongly criticised – being replaced by Christian Eriksen and Amad Diallo. United had to ride their luck – and rely on some big saves from Onana – to stay level during a chaotic opening. But as has often been the case under Ten Hag, a magic moment from one of their big-name attackers helped them get over the line. Rashford endured a disappointing 2023/24 campaign by his lofty standards, scoring seven Premier League goals after netting 17 in 2022/23. If he can rediscover the form he displayed in Ten Hag's first season at the helm, United's hopes of Champions League qualification will be greatly boosted. Club reports

158,158,fulham,2025-04-06,"Fulham held on to beat Liverpool 3-2 at Craven Cottage, with the Premier League leaders failing to open up a 14-point gap at the top of the table. Ryan Sessegnon volleyed Fulham level before Alex Iwobi profited from a defensive mistake to give them the lead. Liverpool remain 11 points ahead of Arsenal, while Fulham move up to eighth, having provided a major boost to their European hopes. How the match unfolded
The Reds took the lead against the run of play when Mac Allister held off Sander Berge and put his laces through an unstoppable long-range shot, but Fulham soon flipped the script. Curtis Jones blocked Andreas Pereira’s first-time cross from the right, but it bounced kindly for Sessegnon, who volleyed past Caoimhin Kelleher at his near post. Another defensive lapse gifted Fulham the lead. Andy Robertson gave the ball to Iwobi on the edge of the box, and he fired past Kelleher with the help of a deflection off the left-back. After Iwobi recycled a corner, Muniz expertly turned Virgil van Dijk to work the space to send a low shot through Kelleher's legs. Diogo Jota’s attempted dink early in the second half was smothered by Bernd Leno, but the goalkeeper would be beaten in the 72nd minute, when Conor Bradley teed up Diaz for a prodded finish. Liverpool continued to push in the dying moments, with former Fulham player Harvey Elliott sending a curling effort against the crossbar, but they could not force an equaliser. Fulham show European credentials
Marco Silva said before this match that Fulham needed to be close to perfection if they wanted to beat the champions elect, and they certainly showed their mettle on Sunday. Liverpool may have landed the first blow on the scoresheet, but Fulham started better. Just five minutes in, they wanted a penalty when a sprawling Kelleher felled Pereira after Ibrahima Konate lost the ball, but the decision not to award a spot-kick was checked and cleared by the VAR. Iwobi was the standout for Silva’s side and could have had a first-half hat-trick, having also forced a fine Kelleher save after cutting inside from the left before sending a long-range strike into the goalkeeper’s arms. Fulham clung on to win back-to-back home matches in the Premier League for the first time since March 2024, and Silva will be determined to build on that momentum against fellow European hopefuls AFC Bournemouth next time out. Robertson then gifted Iwobi the ball twice in the build-up to the second before his deflection helped the strike past Kelleher. Club reports

159,159,liverpool,2025-04-06,"Fulham held on to beat Liverpool 3-2 at Craven Cottage, with the Premier League leaders failing to open up a 14-point gap at the top of the table. The hosts staged a first-half comeback to stun Arne Slot’s side after Alexis Mac Allister opened the scoring with a brilliant long-range strike. A much-improved Liverpool searched for a way back, with substitute Luis Diaz offering them hope by reducing the deficit, but they could not find a late equaliser. Liverpool remain 11 points ahead of Arsenal, while Fulham move up to eighth, having provided a major boost to their European hopes. How the match unfolded
The Reds took the lead against the run of play when Mac Allister held off Sander Berge and put his laces through an unstoppable long-range shot, but Fulham soon flipped the script. Liverpool’s defensive collapse was complete in the 37th minute. After Iwobi recycled a corner, Muniz expertly turned Virgil van Dijk to work the space to send a low shot through Kelleher's legs. Liverpool continued to push in the dying moments, with former Fulham player Harvey Elliott sending a curling effort against the crossbar, but they could not force an equaliser. Liverpool may have landed the first blow on the scoresheet, but Fulham started better. They did not let their heads drop after Mac Allister’s goal and their proactive approach was soon rewarded, with some help from Liverpool’s shaky defence. The hosts had to drop deeper as Liverpool forced the issue in the second half, but they defended their penalty area expertly and got a slice of fortune when Elliott struck the bar. Reds falter on the road
After rivals Everton did Liverpool a favour by drawing with Arsenal on Saturday, it left the Reds needing just four wins to wrap up the Premier League title. Van Dijk may claim there was a foul by Muniz in the build-up to the third, but it was an inspired touch from the Brazilian to flick it over his marker. The Reds dominated the second half, but Mohamed Salah struggled to make a mark, blazing over the bar from close range moments after Robertson had rifled over instead of picking out the unmarked Egyptian. Diaz eventually gave Liverpool a lifeline, but Elliott's curler was the closest they came to a leveller. Club reports

160,160,tottenham-hotspur,2025-04-06,"Southampton’s relegation from the Premier League was confirmed following a 3-1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Brennan Johnson scored twice at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, while Mathys Tel was also on target from the penalty spot to consign Ivan Juric’s side to an immediate return to the Championship. Johnson did the damage with a first-half brace and, despite Mateus Fernandes halving the deficit, Tel's stoppage-time spot-kick ended Spurs' four-match winless league run. Ange Postecoglou’s side, who had dropped to 16th place following Saturday’s results, climb to 14th, with Southampton remaining rooted to the foot of the table. Pedro Porro deflected Kamaldeen Sulemana's volley onto the post at the other end before Spurs broke through in the 13th minute, when Johnson flashed a first-time shot home from Djed Spence's low cross. Southampton failed to deal with a cross and James Maddison nodded the ball back into the area for Johnson to flick home. However, Welington felled Johnson deep into stoppage time, with Tel tucking away the spot-kick to seal Southampton’s fate. Spurs stop the rot
Without a win in four Premier League matches, this is a fixture Spurs will have been thankful for – especially with the need to build momentum ahead of their UEFA Europa League quarter-final first leg against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday. Spurs were unbeaten in their 14 previous league matches against sides starting the day at the bottom of the table, though they were given a scare when Sulemana’s volley deflected onto the post early on. Nevertheless, the hosts were quickly into the ascendancy and edged their noses ahead when Johnson rounded off a swift counter. It duly arrived via Johnson, and that effectively ended the contest. Spurs will have been favourites to prevail here but, nevertheless, it was an important win. Indeed, attention now turns to Frankfurt on Thursday, and the hope of keeping alive their only realistic chance to secure European football next season. Having lost 18 of the 19 previous Premier League matches in which they had conceded the opening goal this season, the signs did not look good when Johnson fired Spurs in front. The Saints faced an even bigger mountain to climb when Johnson scored again, though they did demonstrate some fighting spirit late on with Fernandes neatly finishing. Their return to the Premier League may have been brief, but Southampton’s focus will now be on ensuring they add at least another two points from their final seven matches to avoid recording the lowest tally in a season, which is currently held by Derby County (11 in 2007/08).",Spurs_2025-04-06,southampton,ange-postecoglou,simon-rusk,3,1,31,1,1,51,2.12,4,13,3,4,16,477,16,19,1,0,8,0,2,3,11,2,2,1,24,6,1,424,17,60,18,0,45,15,44,5,9,16,9,52,13,0,3,-0.5528,0,3,5,49,1.04,3,12,5,1,20,470,30,16,1,0,4,1,2,6,9,3,2,0,25,2,1,416,10,46,17,0,55,11,55,5,10,30,7,52,16,2,5,0.4655,3,0,5

Saints are the first side in Premier League history to be relegated with seven matches still to play. Ange Postecoglou’s side, who had dropped to 16th place following Saturday’s results, climb to 14th, with Southampton remaining rooted to the foot of the table. Pedro Porro deflected Kamaldeen Sulemana's volley onto the post at the other end before Spurs broke through in the 13th minute, when Johnson flashed a first-time shot home from Djed Spence's low cross. Southampton failed to deal with a cross and James Maddison nodded the ball back into the area for Johnson to flick home. Ramsdale got down well to keep out Dominic Solanke in the 65th minute, while Sulemana and Yukinari Sugawara’s deflected effort tested Guglielmo Vicario as the Saints launched a late rally. Fernandes halved the deficit in the 90th minute when he neatly controlled Sulemana’s cross, before drilling past Vicario. However, Welington felled Johnson deep into stoppage time, with Tel tucking away the spot-kick to seal Southampton’s fate. Spurs were unbeaten in their 14 previous league matches against sides starting the day at the bottom of the table, though they were given a scare when Sulemana’s volley deflected onto the post early on. Despite Southampton’s late surge that saw them grab a consolation, the victory was never really in doubt, even before Tel converted his penalty. Saints’ fate sealed
After 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers came from behind to beat Ipswich Town on Saturday, this was Southampton’s date with destiny. The Saints faced an even bigger mountain to climb when Johnson scored again, though they did demonstrate some fighting spirit late on with Fernandes neatly finishing.

162,162,crystal-palace,2024-08-24,"Julen Lopetegui has his first win in charge of West Ham as a resounding second-half performance earned a 2-0 victory away to Crystal Palace. Eberechi Eze had chances to open the scoring for Palace in the first half, but struggled to hit the target before Soucek’s opener in the 67th minute. Bowen then punished the hosts by finishing off another quick counter-attack five minutes later to rule out Palace’s hopes of a first win this season. West Ham are off the mark, with their three points moving them up to seventh, while Palace are down in 18th without a point so far. Mohammed Kudus struck the post with a pacy drive for West Ham, but Eze pulled the strings for Palace as they created the better chances. Eze also hit a tame shot into Areola’s gloves in the second half as Palace struggled to regain their flow, allowing West Ham to take hold of the game. No home comforts for Palace 
Despite Soucek having a header fly wide of the far post just three minutes in, Palace came out flying for the first half. Eze was the standout for the hosts, but Jean-Philippe Mateta and Odsonne Edouard had their chances as well as the fluid front three caused problems throughout the first 45 minutes. Following Joachim Andersen’s move to Fulham, the spotlight once again fell on Marc Guehi as he made his 100th Premier League appearance for Palace. But along with Chris Richards and debutant Chadi Riad, Palace stood firm at the back until the second half. Palace’s back five struggled to cope with West Ham’s threat on the counter, often getting caught in two minds between closing down the ball or protecting the space in behind as they were stretched. Having now lost back-to-back games to start their Premier League campaign, Oliver Glasner has problems to fix as they go in search of their first win of the season against Chelsea next weekend. Lopetegui up and running 
Unlike in this exact fixture last season, which saw West Ham concede five goals, including four in the first half, they managed to hold firm against Palace’s pressure. He held up play well when they were forced to go long to get away from Palace’s late push. Club reports

Having made a slow start, West Ham were able to ride out the pressure and claim the points thanks to goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen. Bowen then punished the hosts by finishing off another quick counter-attack five minutes later to rule out Palace’s hopes of a first win this season. West Ham are off the mark, with their three points moving them up to seventh, while Palace are down in 18th without a point so far. Mohammed Kudus struck the post with a pacy drive for West Ham, but Eze pulled the strings for Palace as they created the better chances. His early effort was deflected onto the roof of the net before Alphonse Areola made a sprawling save to deny him 10 minutes later. Eze also hit a tame shot into Areola’s gloves in the second half as Palace struggled to regain their flow, allowing West Ham to take hold of the game. Soucek took advantage of confusion in the box, as Bowen’s cross pinballed through the crowd, drilling his low shot under Dean Henderson to open the scoring. Five minutes later, Bowen got the second. Niclas Fullkrug almost netted his first Hammers goal in the dying seconds, but from a tight angle on the left of the box, he fired into the side netting. Palace’s back five struggled to cope with West Ham’s threat on the counter, often getting caught in two minds between closing down the ball or protecting the space in behind as they were stretched. Lopetegui up and running 
Unlike in this exact fixture last season, which saw West Ham concede five goals, including four in the first half, they managed to hold firm against Palace’s pressure. However, Julen Lopetegui saw a side that were still struggling to link up in the final third, especially in the first half. The Hammers showed the odd promising sign before stepping up their intent in a frenetic start to the second, but it was not until the introduction of new signings that they settled into their groove. Aaron Wan-Bissaka, brought on for his debut, raced away on the counter-attack, opening up the space in the build-up to West Ham’s opener. While it was the starters in Soucek and Bowen that scored the goals, Lopetegui’s new boys have given the manager plenty to think about with champions Manchester City next up at home. Club reports

164,164,tottenham-hotspur,2024-09-15,"Gabriel Magalhaes scored the decisive goal as Arsenal got back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. The defender netted the only goal of the contest after 64 minutes, punishing Spurs for a lapse in concentration from a corner. Despite Spurs' search for a late equaliser, Arsenal were able to hold out and maintain their unbeaten start to the Premier League season. Mikel Arteta’s side are up to second in the table on 10 points, while Spurs are 13th after suffering their second defeat of the campaign. Dominic Solanke came within inches of a debut goal just before the half-hour mark, with his looping header bouncing just wide of the far post while Micky van de Ven was denied by Raya just after half-time. Spurs had opportunities to level the score late on, though looked hesitant to take them, as Pape Sarr hit the target with a low shot straight into Raya’s gloves. Spurs’ derby day blues
In the exact fixture last season, Spurs were 3-0 down at half-time and, although they fought back, they still lost the fixture 3-2. Getting to the break with a clean sheet intact will have felt like a big step for Ange Postecoglou’s side, but they should have been in front after big chances for Kulusevski and Solanke. Their intensity dropped in the second half, offering little after Van de Ven’s shot in the 49th minute until their late push. They also struggled to find spaces in the final third, even after the introductions of Sarr and Wilson Odobert. Postecoglou is yet to beat Arsenal in three attempts, and with just one win from four so far this season, he will be looking to get his team back on track when they welcome Brentford to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next week. Their high press caused Spurs problems as they tried to play out from the back, but they also defended resolutely, with Raya producing some stand-out saves. Club reports

Arsenal profited from another set-piece after 64 minutes, as Bukayo Saka’s pinpoint cross picked out Gabriel, who thumped a free header over Vicario after some slack defending from Cristian Romero.

Arteta faced many questions in the build-up to this match, with many focusing on how he would manage a sudden lack of midfield options. New signing Mikel Merino is out with a shoulder injury, while Declan Rice was suspended after his red card before the international break. But Arteta got creative. He shifted Thomas Partey out on the right, allowing Jorginho to slot in the deeper lying role, with Martinelli providing extra width on the opposite flank. Saka went off after receiving treatment late on. Club reports

But it was Fabian Hurzeler’s side who dug deep and made it two wins from as many matches in a fine start to the Premier League season, with Joao Pedro sneaking in behind Man Utd's defence to head past Andre Onana in the fifth minute of second-half stoppage time. Joao Pedro’s decisive intervention means Brighton have continued their winning start to the season, while United will hope to show a reaction against Liverpool next Sunday. How the match unfolded
Brighton's patient approach paid off in the 32nd minute as Kaoru Mitoma latched onto Joao Pedro’s cross and fizzed it into the middle for Welbeck to poke home from close range. Brighton pushed for a goal in the closing stages and finally got their reward as substitute Simon Adingra picked out an unmarked Joao Pedro to head home from the far post. Welbeck haunts his former club
Any Brighton fans worried that their team would take time to adapt to life under Hurzeler have had those concerns brushed aside. The striker had more opportunities to extend Brighton’s lead after the break, hitting the bar and also sending another header straight into Onana’s gloves, before United fought their way back into the contest and equalised. It did not matter in the end though, as Brighton showed their fight by keeping the pressure on throughout seven minutes of stoppage time. United’s threat from the wide areas proved constant though, with Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui - who got the assist for Amad’s goal - happy to provide the width before a lack of concentration right at the end proved costly as Brighton got the better of them for a fifth time in six matches.

167,167,manchester-united,2024-08-24,"Joao Pedro scored a stoppage-time winner to snatch a 2-1 victory for Brighton & Hove Albion over Manchester United at the AMEX Stadium. It looked like the points were set to be shared on Saturday after United duo Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee both had goals ruled out for offside, the latter in freakish circumstances. But it was Fabian Hurzeler’s side who dug deep and made it two wins from as many matches in a fine start to the Premier League season, with Joao Pedro sneaking in behind Man Utd's defence to head past Andre Onana in the fifth minute of second-half stoppage time. Joao Pedro’s decisive intervention means Brighton have continued their winning start to the season, while United will hope to show a reaction against Liverpool next Sunday. Just seconds later, United were denied an equaliser. After Jason Steele brilliantly saved Rashford’s first effort, he could not keep out the second but the assistant referee flagged for offside, with VAR confirming the decision. Against the run of play, Amad pulled United level when he kept himself onside and sharply cut inside from the right before getting some fortune as his low strike deflected in off Jan Paul van Hecke. Alejandro Garnacho thought he had scored a 70th-minute winner, but with his shot helped over the line by an offside Zirkzee, the on-field decision was overturned following a VAR review. While they did look susceptible to a high turnover at times as United started on the front foot with their high press, it was the hosts’ quality in the final third that turned the tide. And it was a familiar face who punished United with a simple finish in the first half as Welbeck scored the 100th goal of his club career in all competitions, and his sixth against his former side Man Utd. The striker had more opportunities to extend Brighton’s lead after the break, hitting the bar and also sending another header straight into Onana’s gloves, before United fought their way back into the contest and equalised. United’s dynamism fizzles out
Leading up to this match, Erik ten Hag spoke of his ambition to make United more dynamic and aggressive as they looked to build on their late opening-day win over Fulham. It looked like his players had taken that message to heart as they started on the front foot, with Bruno Fernandes tirelessly leading the press from the front as he played in an unfamiliar striker role once again. They had chances in the first half, failing to hit the target more often than not as the frustration among the away fans grew, though it could have been a different story if Rashford had timed his run for the first of two disallowed goals for Man Utd. However, United faded and Ten Hag’s substitutions did not pay off in the same way they did against Fulham. United’s threat from the wide areas proved constant though, with Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui - who got the assist for Amad’s goal - happy to provide the width before a lack of concentration right at the end proved costly as Brighton got the better of them for a fifth time in six matches.

168,168,crystal-palace,2024-09-21,"Manchester United were held to a frustrating goalless draw away at Crystal Palace as Erik ten Hag's attack failed to fire again, despite 24 shots in total and a brilliant display from both goalkeepers. Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson frustrated his former side throughout, though Oliver Glasner's Palace team could have snatched victory if not for missed second-half chances from Ismaila Sarr, denied by Onana's wonderful double-save, and Eberechi Eze. The result leaves Palace in 16th, two points clear of the bottom three, while United are 11th. Eze squandered a glorious chance with 18 minutes remaining, placing wide with the goal at his mercy from Sarr's cutback pass, as Palace's wait for their first win of the season continued. Struggling start continues for Glasner
Glasner appeared to have transformed Palace's fortunes after replacing Roy Hodgson, winning six of the final seven league games last season. That form has not followed into this season, however, with Palace's struggling attack missing the influence of star winger Michael Olise after his move to Bayern Munich. Eze and Jean-Phillipe Mateta do remain from last term's deadly attacking trio, and the England midfielder almost netted before the break when directing straight at Onana from Tyrick Mitchell's cutback offload. Glasner searched for solutions at half-time, replacing the ineffective Mateta with Sarr, who immediately linked up well with Eze to provide some home excitement. The Palace winger made amends for that missed opportunity, leaving two United defenders on the floor before sliding back for Eze, who guided a right-footed finish wide of the bottom-right corner under little pressure. Glasner must find a way for Palace to improve in front of goal if they are to move away from the lower part of the table, with their next clash coming away to struggling Everton. United lack clinical edge
Goals remain the problem for Ten Hag, with United finding the net just five times this season – only Crystal Palace (four), Ipswich Town (three) and Southampton (two) have scored fewer among teams to have played five games in the competition. That issue does not come from struggling to create chances, with Christian Eriksen twice finding De Ligt from set-piece situations at Selhurst Park, only to be thwarted by the one-man wall of Henderson. De Ligt's centre-back partner Lisandro Martinez almost squirmed another chance under the desperate dive of the Palace goalkeeper, who also foiled Garnacho with a fine save early on. Club reports

169,169,manchester-united,2024-09-21,"Manchester United were held to a frustrating goalless draw away at Crystal Palace as Erik ten Hag's attack failed to fire again, despite 24 shots in total and a brilliant display from both goalkeepers. Ten Hag's side were hammered 4-0 in this exact fixture last season and the United manager will have again been disappointed at the draw on Saturday. Alejandro Garnacho was denied by the woodwork after 27 minutes, with the same outcome following for Bruno Fernandes on the rebound, as United squandered numerous opportunities in a one-sided first half. Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson frustrated his former side throughout, though Oliver Glasner's Palace team could have snatched victory if not for missed second-half chances from Ismaila Sarr, denied by Onana's wonderful double-save, and Eberechi Eze. The result leaves Palace in 16th, two points clear of the bottom three, while United are 11th. How the match unfolded
Buoyed by their midweek EFL Cup thrashing of Barnsley, United controlled the opening period without reward as Garnacho and Matthijs de Ligt forced impressive early stops from Henderson. Garnacho's curling effort was denied by the woodwork after Diogo Dalot's incisive pass before the half-hour mark, with Fernandes cannoning his follow-up attempt off the top of the crossbar. Fernandes went close again after the interval, curling narrowly wide of the top-left corner before Garnacho's hopeful left-wing attempt forced another smart Henderson stop. Andre Onana was required at the other end to keep the visitors level, however, pushing away Eddie Nketiah's rasping drive before denying Sarr at full-stretch with a wonderful save that stunned the watching crowd. Eze and Jean-Phillipe Mateta do remain from last term's deadly attacking trio, and the England midfielder almost netted before the break when directing straight at Onana from Tyrick Mitchell's cutback offload. Sarr should have opened the scoring just past the hour, racing in from Nketiah's saved attempt but failed to beat the onrushing Onana from point-blank range. The Palace winger made amends for that missed opportunity, leaving two United defenders on the floor before sliding back for Eze, who guided a right-footed finish wide of the bottom-right corner under little pressure. United lack clinical edge
Goals remain the problem for Ten Hag, with United finding the net just five times this season – only Crystal Palace (four), Ipswich Town (three) and Southampton (two) have scored fewer among teams to have played five games in the competition. De Ligt's centre-back partner Lisandro Martinez almost squirmed another chance under the desperate dive of the Palace goalkeeper, who also foiled Garnacho with a fine save early on. Joshua Zirkzee was brought in from Bologna to turn around United's attacking output, though the forward headed wide and then prodded a stretching finish at Henderson following Fernandes' cross in the opening half. Ever-reliant Fernandes almost broke the deadlock after linking up with Zirkzee, but – in a familiar tale for United – failed to find the top-left corner with an outside-of-the-boot finish from the perimeter of the box. Marcus Rashford's introduction did little to improve the attacking penetration, an aspect which Ten Hag will be desperate to improve in United's next league clash at home to Tottenham. Club reports

But Pep Guardiola's team struggled to create chances against a well-drilled United backline, with Phil Foden wasting their best opening early in the second half. The clearest opportunity for a winner fell to United, through substitute Joshua Zirkzee, but Ederson made a fine save to ensure City at least earned a point. United, meanwhile, go back into 13th place above Tottenham Hotspur, who beat and relegated Southampton earlier in the day. How the match unfolded
Less than a minute had passed when Ruben Dias narrowly avoided conceding a penalty, with his panicked foul on Alejandro Garnacho adjudged to have taken place just outside the area. Foden almost squeezed a low drive inside the near post, but the clearest chance of the first half fell to Garnacho, who was unable to make a proper connection with a stooping header when unmarked. A flowing United move started by Bruno Fernandes ended with Patrick Dorgu shooting wildly off target, while Ilkay Gundogan dragged another hopeful attempt wide for City, who were flat in attack. Andre Onana was worked by Marmoush's free-kick just after the hour mark, while Manuel Ugarte's 20-yard drive faded away from Ederson's left post at the other end. United could have won it when Garnacho's cutback found Zirkzee in the centre of the penalty area, but Ederson sprang to his left to claw the strike away and preserve City's clean sheet. No support for fantastic Fernandes
United's attacking struggles under Ruben Amorim have been well documented, with their total of 37 Premier League goals this season being the sixth worst in the top flight. In Fernandes, United have a player capable of both starting and finishing moves, but it sometimes feels like they are relying on him to do it all. A wonderful chest around the corner to Rasmus Hojlund started the move that ended with Dorgu slicing wide, while Ugarte was unable to keep his footing when Fernandes picked him out with a clever ball to the far post. Fernandes covered every blade of grass but lacked the proper support from his team-mates – Garnacho was particularly wasteful after troubling Dias with an early run, while Hojlund did not attempt a shot before being substituted in the 71st minute. There were at least positives in defence, as Harry Maguire replaced the injured Matthijs de Ligt and played an hour as United ended a run of eight home league matches without a clean sheet – their worst such streak since 2021.

Diamonds aren't forever?
With Erling Haaland likely to be sidelined for most of the run-in and no other natural striker in his squad, Guardiola must get creative with City's attacking options. They were hardly challenged in their first match since Haaland's injury – a 2-0 victory over Leicester City on Wednesday – and Guardiola opted for a different approach here, making four changes to his line-up and employing a midfield diamond. Two days after announcing he will leave the club at the end of the season, Kevin De Bruyne often found himself as City's most advanced player, with Foden, Marmoush and Gundogan interchanging around him. But City's patient possession play was not accompanied by any penetrative runs, with the visitors clearly wary of overcommitting and being caught out on the counter-attack. Guardiola threw on substitutes Jeremy Doku and Jack Grealish in a bid to turn the tide, but neither player managed to get going as United protected their goal well.

Ndiaye stroked home from 12 yards to score his seventh Premier League goal of the season, the most for Everton this season, after Myles Lewis-Skelly had fouled Jack Harrison early in the second half. Everton go 14th on 35 points. How the match unfolded
Everton survived some early pressure as Tim Iroegbunam's block denied Raheem Sterling, while Jarrad Branthwaite's goalline header stopped a Declan Rice corner from curling in. Groans of frustration were audible late in the first half as Everton sat off Arsenal, who almost doubled their lead when Trossard's shot was blocked by the feet of Jordan Pickford. It was Arsenal who started the second half poorly, though, as Lewis-Skelly was caught the wrong side of Harrison and hauled him down inside the box. Martinelli drew a full-stretch save from Pickford and Mikel Merino sent a header wide in the latter stages, but Arsenal were flat for much of the second half and could have few complaints at having to settle for a point. Everton's game of two halves
David Moyes' second spell in the Everton dugout has been a roaring success, with Wednesday's Merseyside derby defeat to Liverpool just their second Premier League loss since his comeback. But his team started slowly on Saturday, and Moyes had his head in his hands when a breakdown in communication between Idrissa Gueye and Branthwaite led to Trossard opening the scoring. Everton were generally sloppy in possession and struggled to lay a glove on Arsenal before the interval, when they were jeered off by a frustrated Goodison Park crowd. But Moyes' half-time words did the trick, as Harrison's sheer determination got him into the position to win their spot-kick. While Everton never truly looked like getting a winner, Moyes will be delighted with the way they battled for their point in the second half. Arteta insisted on Friday he would not look past Everton, but captain Odegaard joined Saka and Martinelli on the bench at Goodison as the manager rotated his squad. Trossard's pace and clever movement brought a more fluid look to the Arsenal attack, and he had already drawn a goal-saving challenge from Branthwaite before he opened the scoring. After being beaten by the bounce of the ball, he wrapped an arm around Harrison then fell on to his opponent's leg inside the area to concede the penalty. Having something to defend played into Everton's hands, and Arsenal's performance – much like their title challenge – fizzled out somewhat. Club reports

Playing as Arsenal's central striker, Leandro Trossard had given Mikel Arteta's visitors a deserved half-time lead, but their performance tailed off after the break. Ahead of the first leg of Arsenal's UEFA Champions League quarter-final tie against Real Madrid on Tuesday, Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli all started on the bench and were unable to make an impact after coming on. Arsenal are now 11 points behind leaders Liverpool, who can go 14 points clear at the top with a win at Fulham on Sunday and need a maximum of 11 more points to win the title. How the match unfolded
Everton survived some early pressure as Tim Iroegbunam's block denied Raheem Sterling, while Jarrad Branthwaite's goalline header stopped a Declan Rice corner from curling in. But Arsenal went ahead from a lightning 34th-minute counter-attack.

Arsenal fade after bright start
With Liverpool having pulled clear at the top of the Premier League, Arsenal's most realistic chance of silverware this season appears to be in the Champions League, with Madrid visiting Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. Arteta insisted on Friday he would not look past Everton, but captain Odegaard joined Saka and Martinelli on the bench at Goodison as the manager rotated his squad. Trossard's pace and clever movement brought a more fluid look to the Arsenal attack, and he had already drawn a goal-saving challenge from Branthwaite before he opened the scoring. Arsenal were comfortable for 45 minutes, but one misjudgment from Lewis-Skelly changed this game. Having something to defend played into Everton's hands, and Arsenal's performance – much like their title challenge – fizzled out somewhat. Jakub Kiwior's composed performance at the back will be a positive for the Gunners, though, as they prepare for the challenge of facing Madrid without the injured Gabriel. Club reports

It was all square at the break, with Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen cancelling out Nicolas Jackson and Cole Palmer’s goals in a thrilling first half. Cunha and Mario Lemina had a goal each ruled out for the hosts, but Gary O’Neil’s team were cut open at the back and ultimately, soundly beaten. Chelsea’s victory takes them into the top half as one of seven teams on three points, while Wolves are 19th after two defeats. Wolves almost hit back when Yerson Mosquera struck a post before Cunha was denied by the assistant referee’s flag, with VAR confirming Strand Larsen had strayed offside. Cunha would not be denied again, though, as the hosts pounced on a loose pass in midfield, with the Brazilian bending a first-time finish past Robert Sanchez. But it was Madueke who stole the show after the break, netting his hat-trick with three similar, low strikes from the right-hand side of the box, with a Wolves response through Lemina ruled out for offside.

However, all of Wolves’ bright attacking play fizzled out in the second half, with the hosts struggling to show the same threat when Chelsea fixed their own defensive problems.

However, the hosts hit back seven minutes later through Dominic Solanke's first goal for the club after Mark Flekken parried James Maddison’s initial effort. Brennan Johnson's neat strike completed the turnaround inside the opening half an hour, while Maddison rounded off a swift counter to seal the victory late on. Tottenham move above their opponents into 10th place in the Premier League with seven points, one more than Thomas Frank’s side in 12th after five rounds of matches. That advantage only lasted until the eighth minute, though, as Tottenham responded well to falling behind. Maddison pounced on Ethan Pinnock's loose pass and Flekken could only push his shot straight to Solanke, who tucked home the rebound. Johnson then rounded off a swift counter on 28 minutes when he fired past Flekken from a tight angle to make it goals in back-to-back games in all competitions. Flekken and Guglielmo Vicario made some good saves to keep the scoring down, but Spurs made sure of the win when Cristian Romero broke up a Brentford attack five minutes from time and found Son Heung-min, who squared for Maddison to dink home. Spurs come from behind again
Postecoglou's men left it late against Coventry City in their midweek EFL Cup win – Djed Spence equalising in the 88th minute and Johnson snatching victory in stoppage time. The team scoring first had not won the previous four Premier League meetings between the sides, so Tottenham will not have been too concerned by Mbeumo's early strike. Solanke was in the right place at the right time to open his Spurs account with the equaliser, while Johnson finished well across Flekken. Some smart Flekken saves prevented the scoreline from being more comfortable for Postecoglou's side, but they could eventually breathe easier when Maddison put the result beyond doubt. However, for the second week running, they saw their early lead overturned, with Tottenham's pace and power on the counter just too hot to handle. To their credit, Brentford stuck to the task and made sure they stayed in the contest until the 85th minute, when Maddison sealed the points. Nevertheless, their form is certainly ropey away from the Gtech Community Stadium, where they have won both their opening two fixtures this season, so they will be thankful for back-to-back home outings against West Ham and Wolves to come.

Although they left the Etihad Stadium empty handed last week, Brentford could certainly take plenty of positives from their performance against the reigning champions. The Bees built on that momentum with another scintillating start, becoming only the second team in Premier League history – after City – to score in the opening minute of successive games. To their credit, Brentford stuck to the task and made sure they stayed in the contest until the 85th minute, when Maddison sealed the points. Nevertheless, their form is certainly ropey away from the Gtech Community Stadium, where they have won both their opening two fixtures this season, so they will be thankful for back-to-back home outings against West Ham and Wolves to come.

178,178,liverpool,2024-09-21,"Liverpool surged to the Premier League summit after Luis Diaz scored twice in a convincing 3-0 victory over AFC Bournemouth. Visiting forward Antoine Semenyo saw an early strike overturned for offside following a VAR review before one-way traffic ensued in the first half at Anfield, with Diaz twice on target. Darwin Nunez added an eye-catching third with a brilliant strike before the break as Arne Slot's side responded in style to their 1-0 defeat against Nottingham Forest last time out in the competition. Saturday's routine win moves Liverpool, at least temporarily, to top spot before Sunday's heavyweight encounter between Manchester City and Arsenal, while Bournemouth drop to 13th spot. How the match unfolded
The Anfield crowd were silenced just three minutes in after Semenyo turned home Justin Kluivert's cross, only for the goal to be overturned for offside after a VAR review. That wake-up call kicked the Reds into gear, though, with Diaz rounding the onrushing Kepa and finishing after bringing down Ibrahima Konate’s long punt forward on 26 minutes. Diaz fired a second past Kepa soon following Trent Alexander-Arnold's driving run, for the latter's 100th goal involvement in all competitions for Liverpool (81 assists, 19 goals). Nunez then curled a wonderful left-footed effort only nine minutes later as Slot's side went in 3-0 up at the break. Liverpool were unable to add to their tally in the second half, with Mohamed Salah going closest with a low effort that was cleared off the line by Milos Kerkez. Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth almost found a late consolation when Luis Sinisterra twice tested Caoimhin Kelleher - the second of the chances deflecting off the crossbar as Liverpool fortuitously preserved their clean sheet. Ruthless Reds return to form
Powered by their superstar frontline, Slot's side rediscovered the form from before the international break, backing up a fine victory over AC Milan in the UEFA Champions League in midweek. Semenyo’s disallowed strike proved an early warning, though Diaz soon forced a smart Kepa save from distance before the Bournemouth goalkeeper thwarted Salah when one-on-one after Alexis Mac Allister’s stunning pass. Kepa's questionable positioning when attempting to cut out Konate's long ball created Diaz’s well-taken opener, before the Colombian produced another confident low finish after Alexander-Arnold's marauding inside run. Nunez capped a ruthless first-half display in style after being played through in a give-and-go with Salah, and that dominance allowed Slot to further flex his attacking muscle in the second half. Cody Gakpo and Federico Chiesa were both introduced, with the latter making his Premier League debut and testing Kepa with an optimistic volley that would have marked a dream start to life at Anfield. Leaving Diogo Jota on the bench throughout, Slot has attacking options in abundance as Liverpool prepare to further boost their title credentials in their next league trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Strong showing, but another defeat for Iraola
While the scoreline suggests a comfortable outing for Liverpool, Bournemouth had their moments that made the encounter a tricky affair for the hosts to navigate. Semenyo’s disallowed opener was a sign of their intent to earn a first Premier League win against the Reds at Anfield, and the Bournemouth forward went close again when rushing a close-range chance against Kelleher, starting in place of injured No 1 Alisson. Evanilson also proved to be a nuisance at the top end of the pitch, but the former Porto forward lacked support for large parts when up against Konate and Virgil van Dijk. Dango Ouattara's half-time introduction injected the pace that was lacking in Iraola's attack, though, with his trickery causing Alexander-Arnold several problems and forcing a more cautious approach from the attacking full-back. Sinisterra and Alex Scott both troubled 'keeper Kelleher late on with Bournemouth's best chances, but the early damage proved too much after Liverpool thrived against the struggling two-man midfield of Lewis Cook and Ryan Christie.

Ipswich now appear destined for the drop, with their poor home form a major factor.

But after Wolves spurned many chances, Sarabia’s 65th-minute introduction turned the game around, as he nestled the equaliser into the bottom corner less than 10 minutes later. How the match unfolded
Wolves started brightly, with Alex Palmer forced into early action. He kept out Strand Larsen’s low drive with his leg before tipping Toti Gomes's header over the bar. Toti had an effort cleared off the line at the other end, but Wolves' best first-half chance fell to Emmanuel Agbadou. That action of handling a pass from his own player meant Wolves were awarded an indirect free-kick six yards out, but Sam Morsy threw himself in the way of Agbadou’s shot. Wolves upped the pressure after the break, with Joao Gomes rattling the near post, but they would not find a way through until the 72nd minute as Sarabia latched onto the rebound of his own blocked shot to pick out the bottom-right corner.

Moments after assisting Delap, O’Shea was perfectly placed to deny Toti in front of an open goal, while Morsy bravely threw himself in front of Agbadou's drive from Wolves' indirect free-kick. But they could not hold out under the never-ending Wolves pressure, as Jens Cajuste failed to block Sarabia’s volley, having stuck out a foot to stop his first attempt.

182,182,liverpool,2024-08-25,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot got his first home Premier League win at Anfield as goals from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah secured a 2-0 victory over Brentford. After winning by the same scoreline away to Ipswich Town last week, Slot saw his team dominate much of Sunday’s encounter to keep up their perfect start to the 2024/25 Premier League season. Slot waited just 13 minutes for his first home match to spark into life – Diogo Jota leading a rapid counter-attack from a Brentford corner before laying it off to Diaz, who lashed in beyond Mark Flekken to mark his 100th Reds appearance in style. It was also Virgil van Dijk's 100th Premier League appearance for Liverpool at Anfield. While Brentford – again without star striker Ivan Toney who is attracting interest in the transfer window – went close through Kristoffer Ajer, Liverpool’s dominance told when Diaz turned provider for the Reds’ second, which was expertly guided home by Salah with 20 minutes remaining. Liverpool, who visit Manchester United next week, are one of four sides to have won both of their opening matches, while Brentford sit 13th on three points. How the match unfolded
Diaz’s thumping finish got the ball rolling early for Liverpool, with Flekken denying Andrew Robertson a quickfire second. Liverpool responded in force – Nathan Collins did brilliantly to deny Jota a certain goal, before Dominik Szoboszlai struck a post directly from a corner and Ibrahima Konate headed at Flekken, who then got to a low Diaz effort. But Flekken could do little to prevent Salah tucking home following some quick thinking from Diaz, while only the crossbar prevented substitute Cody Gakpo adding a third in the closing stages. Slot gets into his stride
Slot has big shoes to fill, but two wins from as many matches is the way he would have wished to get started. The Dutchman is the first Liverpool manager since Graeme Souness in April 1991 to win his first two league fixtures in charge, and in the moments his team really clicked through the gears in front of a record crowd for a league match at Anfield, they looked superb. There were a few slack moments defensively that could worry Slot, including when Robertson bundled over Bryan Mbeumo in the box, only for the offside flag to spare the full-back’s blushes, but some of Liverpool’s attacking play was delightful. Indeed, the move of the match involved Salah cutting in from the right and combining wonderfully with Jota and Alexis Mac Allister, with the Egyptian just unable to apply the finish. The opener was the perfect example of the ""heavy metal football"" that brought Liverpool such success under their former manager, while their second came about because of some relentless pressing, great vision from Diaz, and a touch of class from talisman Salah. For Slot, it will be a case of blending the two styles. If he gets that right, then there is no reason why Liverpool cannot challenge for silverware in his first season. Club reports

Key facts
Slot became only the third manager to win both of his first two top-flight matches in charge of Liverpool while seeing his side also keep a clean sheet in each, after Matt McQueen in 1923 and Graeme Souness in 1991. Luis Díaz has scored Liverpool's first Premier League goal at Anfield in each of the last three seasons. Indeed, 76 per cent of Díaz's Premier League goals have come at Anfield (13/17) – the highest proportion of any player with 15+ goals for Liverpool in the competition.

Toney situation needs a resolution
Brentford are certainly open to selling Toney, and it appears his future may soon be resolved, with reports suggesting Saudi Pro League team Al-Ahli are close to reaching an agreement with the Bees. The 28-year-old’s absence was not felt when Brentford beat Crystal Palace last time out, but against the very top teams the Premier League has to offer, the lack of a striker of Toney’s calibre was more apparent. With less than a week left in the window, Thomas Frank will surely want the situation to come to a head one way or the other so Brentford can, if needed, reinvest the funds in a quality replacement before Friday’s transfer deadline, especially with Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Man Utd to come in their next three Premier League away matches. Mbeumo was a livewire up front, but there was no clinical edge to Brentford’s play – the kind of edge that Toney has previously brought to the table in abundance. Club reports

The Villa Park faithful were treated to two goals in two minutes early in the first half, with Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen putting them 2-0 up after 15 minutes. A much-improved second-half performance from Forest led to half-time substitute Jota Silva halving the deficit after he neatly turned Villa’s defence to pick out the far corner. Despite coming close on a number of occasions, Forest’s pressure did not turn into a late equaliser, as Villa were able to extend their winning streak to seven games in all competitions. Unai Emery’s side climb to sixth, level on points with Manchester City, who face Manchester United on Sunday, while Forest remain third, missing the chance to close the gap on Arsenal. How the match unfolded
Villa made a lightning-quick start, with Ian Maatsen seeing a shot saved before Rogers fizzed a low drive across the box and into the bottom-right corner 13 minutes in. Anthony Elanga almost recreated his wonderful midweek solo goal against Man United shortly after those two goals, only to drag wide after a marauding run, while Callum Hudson-Odoi’s strike from the right of the box also rolled past Emiliano Martinez’s far post. Villa ride the storm
Villa picked up where they left off after the international break with two comfortable wins in the FA Cup and Premier League, but things were not quite so smooth ahead of a big week. With a Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday looming, Emery rung the changes, but Villa made the best start possible by throwing everything they had at Forest. Rogers had been a doubt heading into this game, having limped off against Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday, but he showed no signs of injury as he ghosted in behind to reach Youri Tielemans’ pass. After Malen struck his second goal in two games for Villa, it looked like the hosts were cruising, with Martinez forced into little work in the first half. Emery had some tricks up his own sleeve, though, and the momentum swung back in their favour, with Marco Asensio and Tielemans denied by Sels, who did brilliantly to smother Rashford’s late chance before clawing away the rebound. Next up in the league for Villa is a trip to Southampton, who may be relegated by the time the match is played. Forest have received plaudits this season for their defensive stability, but they were uncharacteristically shaky in the opening stages and had already got away with one when Asensio drilled wide before the two quickfire Villa goals. Jota not only got the goal, but his busy approach rattled the Villa defence as he continuously caused problems around the box. Club reports

Forest falter against dynamic approach
The race for the top five is hotting up with only seven games left, though Forest still remains in the driving seat for a place in next year’s Champions League. With Arsenal dropping points against Everton earlier on Saturday, Forest could have closed the gap to second. Forest have received plaudits this season for their defensive stability, but they were uncharacteristically shaky in the opening stages and had already got away with one when Asensio drilled wide before the two quickfire Villa goals. Nuno was able to shore things up before the break, with his side showing promise on the counter-attack, but the half-time substitution turned the tide. Williams was a lively figure as well and could have snatched a late equaliser after a neat one-two with Morgan Gibbs-White, only to drag his effort narrowly wide
Forest have never been able to overturn a two-goal half-time deficit in the Premier League, with this the 79th game in which it has happened. Nuno will be keen to get back on track with Everton up next. Club reports

The visitors had controlled the first half, but West Ham flipped the script in the space of seven second-half minutes, with a pair of headers from substitute Niclas Fullkrug and captain Jarrod Bowen putting the Hammers ahead. The result sees West Ham, who have themselves gone four top-flight matches without a win, edge up to 15th in the table, while Bournemouth move up one place and into ninth position on 45 points. The Cherries did take the lead in the 38th minute when Areola could only parry Antoine Semenyo’s shot into the path of Evanilson, who gratefully tucked the ball in from inside the six-yard box. Despite rarely threatening in the contest up to the hour-mark, West Ham drew level after 61 minutes when Fullkrug rose highest to power James Ward-Prowse’s corner past Kepa Arrizabalaga, before Bowen did well to convert Mohammed Kudus’ cross with an aerial effort of his own. Potter’s subs improve blunt Hammers
Graham Potter had urged his players to show more dynamism in attack and an improved competitive spirit in their quest to climb up the Premier League table, but the Hammers head coach had to wait until well after the break to see his side trouble Bournemouth after a lacklustre opening period. West Ham’s only opportunity of note before the break came when Ollie Scarles dug out a cross that was crying out for a touch inside the box, but no one in claret and blue was waiting. Potter opted to make one change at half-time, with Scarles replaced by Emerson, but he quickly turned to his bench again in the 54th minute. West Ham looked more composed and threatening in attack almost immediately, with Fullkrug’s equaliser their first shot on target just seven minutes after he had come on. Bowen was on a run without a goal or an assist in his last five appearances at the London Stadium, but he ended that drought with a fine header. And West Ham had their chances to snatch all three points late on, but Bowen sent two efforts narrowly off target and substitute Luis Guilherme hit the side-netting. Though it was not the result they had hoped for, West Ham have an improved second-half performance to build on ahead of facing Liverpool at Anfield next week. But the Cherries were unable to deal with West Ham’s revival provided by their substitutes, and Bournemouth faded as an attacking force until late on when Semenyo saw his strike from a promising position repelled by the legs of Areola.

The result sees West Ham, who have themselves gone four top-flight matches without a win, edge up to 15th in the table, while Bournemouth move up one place and into ninth position on 45 points. How the match unfolded
Bournemouth almost made a lightning start to the match, with Evanilson heading just wide from Dango Ouattara’s teasing delivery from the left-hand side after just two minutes. The Cherries did take the lead in the 38th minute when Areola could only parry Antoine Semenyo’s shot into the path of Evanilson, who gratefully tucked the ball in from inside the six-yard box. However, Bournemouth were able to claim a point in the closing stages through Evanilson, with the Brazilian on hand to turn Dean Huijsen’s knockdown into the net, moving him up to nine league goals this season. Potter’s subs improve blunt Hammers
Graham Potter had urged his players to show more dynamism in attack and an improved competitive spirit in their quest to climb up the Premier League table, but the Hammers head coach had to wait until well after the break to see his side trouble Bournemouth after a lacklustre opening period. Cherries’ European hopes continues to falter
Bournemouth were one of the surprise packages in the opening parts of the season, with many tipping Andoni Iraola’s side to kick on and seal a place in the top seven. After Evanilson’s opener, Bournemouth almost entered half-time further in front, but Illia Zabarnyi could only head on to the crossbar from close range following Lewis Cook’s inviting corner kick. But the Cherries were unable to deal with West Ham’s revival provided by their substitutes, and Bournemouth faded as an attacking force until late on when Semenyo saw his strike from a promising position repelled by the legs of Areola. There was a promising late breakaway too, but substitute Daniel Jebbison was unable to pick out Cook with Bournemouth having an overload in attack, as the outcome of an entertaining contest hung in the balance until the final moments. Bournemouth need results fast if they are to disrupt a competitive battle for the European places. They will come up against Fulham, who are also seeking a continental spot, in their next Premier League encounter at the Vitality Stadium. Club reports

188,188,bournemouth,2024-08-25,"AFC Bournemouth were denied a dramatic winner against Newcastle United as Dango Ouattara's stoppage-time goal was overturned following a VAR review in Sunday's 1-1 draw. The Cherries would have been deserving victors at the Vitality Stadium in a match celebrating the club's 125th anniversary, having controlled both before and after Marcus Tavernier's first-half opener. It looked as though substitute Ouattara would have the decisive say, only for his effort to be ruled out for striking his arm
Former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe is still yet to beat his old side in the Premier League, but would have been relieved to come away with a point that keeps Newcastle within touch of the teams at the top, while the Cherries remain winless. How the match unfolded
Bournemouth could have scored twice before Tavernier's opener, with Nick Pope saving superbly from debutant Evanilson and then watching Antoine Semenyo's fine effort bounce away off the crossbar. It was Semenyo who forged the breakthrough after 37 minutes, stealing possession from Joelinton before advancing into the area and squaring to Tavernier in front of an open goal, while a cross from the same man after the hour should have seen Evanilson off the mark. Chances followed at either end, with Neto denying both Dan Burn and Bruno Guimaraes, before Ouattara celebrated an apparent winner, only for the goal to be disallowed when it was judged that the ball came off the top of the Bournemouth player's arm, rather than his head, following a corner. New man missing decisive touch
Bournemouth won this fixture 2-0 last season, with Dominic Solanke scoring both goals. Evanilson is the man the Cherries have brought in to replace their departed talisman, but he could not repeat the feat on Sunday. That goal may well have been enough to win the game, stop the Newcastle fightback before it began, and avoid the late drama that left Bournemouth so frustrated. In the absence of Solanke, he was Bournemouth's chief attacking threat, firmly winning his battle with former club-mate Kelly. If the exciting winger continues to create such opportunities, both Evanilson and winless Bournemouth will surely get off the mark soon enough. Club reports

But Anthony Gordon equalised with 14 minutes to play, setting the stage for a chaotic finale in which both sides came close to claiming all three points. It looked as though substitute Ouattara would have the decisive say, only for his effort to be ruled out for striking his arm
Former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe is still yet to beat his old side in the Premier League, but would have been relieved to come away with a point that keeps Newcastle within touch of the teams at the top, while the Cherries remain winless. It was Semenyo who forged the breakthrough after 37 minutes, stealing possession from Joelinton before advancing into the area and squaring to Tavernier in front of an open goal, while a cross from the same man after the hour should have seen Evanilson off the mark. Harvey Barnes’s introduction helped spur Newcastle back into the contest, and after Alexander Isak and Joelinton went close with headers, the substitute winger supplied a superb delivery from which Gordon converted. The Brazil international kept the Newcastle centre-backs busy and drew one sharp stop from Pope, yet he surely should have scored when Semenyo's footwork dazzled Lloyd Kelly to create space for a teasing centre. That goal may well have been enough to win the game, stop the Newcastle fightback before it began, and avoid the late drama that left Bournemouth so frustrated. Attacking approach pays off for Howe
Newcastle's away form had been a problem in the first half of last season, with Howe openly identifying their record on the road as key to their hopes of an improved campaign this time out. The Magpies offered precious little until Barnes arrived and changed the game with his direct running, clearly determined to make his mark after a frustrating first season on Tyneside. Kieran Trippier, whose future is reportedly uncertain, appeared alongside Barnes, while Lewis Hall and Joe Willock were also introduced before Gordon's leveller, with an attacking line-up belatedly securing a foothold in the match for Newcastle. This ambitious approach could have cost them at the other end as they were exposed from a stoppage-time corner, but they looked much more like themselves going forward and Howe may see this as a blueprint for the season ahead.

Leicester’s response came with 17 minutes left on the clock as Mavididi reacted first to sweep home from a corner. Everton are up to 19th in the table on goal difference, while the Foxes sit in 15th. The torrential rain in Leicester nearly helped the hosts to a goal a minute later as Mavididi unintentionally tested Jordan Pickford with a wayward cross, but the goalkeeper kept it out. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was played in down the right of the box by Dwight McNeil in the 65th minute, but he saw his shot across goal palmed away at full stretch by Mads Hermansen. Mavididi eventually found the equaliser for Leicester after Everton failed to clear Harry Winks’ corner, and the winger pounced first to direct the loose ball into the net on 73 minutes. The goal refreshed the home side’s impetus in the closing stages as both Mavididi and Facundo Buonanotte saw shots blocked by a desperate Everton defence in the last five minutes. Rain soaks Leicester’s chances
Playing at home is meant to provide an advantage for the home side, but Leicester could not find a way to use the adverse weather conditions in the East Midlands to aid them to all three points, despite causing problems for Pickford. Mavididi almost took advantage of the wet conditions in the 35th minute through an attempted cross that flew dangerously close to the near post. In the end, Mavididi’s breakthrough came through inattentive defending from Everton rather than any rain-assisted play. Their defence fared better against the experience of Leicester’s attack, led by Jamie Vardy, but eventually conceded a seemingly inevitable equaliser on 73 minutes. It was a lapse in concentration from a struggling Everton defence as James Tarkowski and Michael Keane both attempted to clear Winks’ corner before it dropped into the melee and Mavididi pounced. The visitors, however, managed to hold off the onslaught of a rejuvenated Leicester attack in the closing stages to stop a losing run. Club reports

The Toffees passed on a strong chance just five minutes in as Ndiaye fired a pinpoint cross to the far post, but Jesper Lindstrom could not get his volley on target. The torrential rain in Leicester nearly helped the hosts to a goal a minute later as Mavididi unintentionally tested Jordan Pickford with a wayward cross, but the goalkeeper kept it out.

Everton had taken the lead in their last two matches before falling to defeat. Against both Bournemouth and Aston Villa, the Toffees led 2-0 before going on to lose 3-2. It was a lapse in concentration from a struggling Everton defence as James Tarkowski and Michael Keane both attempted to clear Winks’ corner before it dropped into the melee and Mavididi pounced.

192,192,west-ham-united,2024-08-31,"Erling Haaland scored yet another hat-trick as Manchester City maintained their perfect start to the Premier League season with a 3-1 win at West Ham United. After scoring a treble against Ipswich Town last week, Haaland took his tally to seven goals for 2024/25 at the London Stadium. The Norwegian produced a composed one-on-one finish for the opener before arrowing a powerful strike home for his second on the half-hour mark, after a Ruben Dias own goal had briefly dragged West Ham level. Mohammed Kudus went close to a second West Ham equaliser after the interval, but Haaland wrapped up the points with another breakaway finish with seven minutes to play. The victory keeps City top of the early-season standings with nine points from nine available, while West Ham are 14th with three points from three games under Julen Lopetegui. Kevin De Bruyne then rattled the post as City dominated, but West Ham levelled out of nowhere with 19 minutes gone. Jarrod Bowen got to the byline to cross, with his delivery hitting Dias and creeping beyond Ederson. City were back in the ascendancy on the half-hour mark, though, with Haaland putting a brilliant finish past Alphonse Areola after being teed up by Rico Lewis. West Ham almost struck on the counter-attack again after the restart, but Kudus could only blast his effort off the near post after scampering away down the left. West Ham almost pulled one back through Crysencio Summerville at the death, but Ederson pushed his curling effort onto a post and to safety. Fresh from scoring a hat-trick in last week's comeback victory over Ipswich, Haaland was at his ruthless best at the London Stadium following an early sighter that saw him head Silva's dinked cross off target. His second goal was something special, with the striker firing into the top-right corner with no backlift to give Areola no chance. His third, meanwhile, showed a touch of class not always associated with the Norwegian powerhouse, a cultured dink killing any faint hopes of a West Ham comeback. West Ham come up short
Despite a second defeat in two home league matches under Lopetegui, there were positives for West Ham to take on Saturday. Even at 2-1 down early in the second half, West Ham had their moments on the break, not least when Kudus showed electric pace to escape his marker and leave the goal frame shaking with a powerful effort. City did pen their hosts back for long periods and deserved the win, but Lopetegui will not have been too disappointed by his side's showing. Club reports

Haaland was wayward with an early header but redeemed himself after just 10 minutes, slotting home after Bernardo Silva stole possession to thread him through on goal. Kevin De Bruyne then rattled the post as City dominated, but West Ham levelled out of nowhere with 19 minutes gone. City were back in the ascendancy on the half-hour mark, though, with Haaland putting a brilliant finish past Alphonse Areola after being teed up by Rico Lewis. City got their two-goal cushion with seven minutes remaining, as Haaland darted onto Matheus Nunes' through-ball before clipping his finish over substitute goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. Haaland on a mission
Since arriving in the Premier League in 2022, Haaland has earned a reputation as a fast starter, and the 2024/25 campaign has been no different. Fresh from scoring a hat-trick in last week's comeback victory over Ipswich, Haaland was at his ruthless best at the London Stadium following an early sighter that saw him head Silva's dinked cross off target. City's rivals have every reason to be fearful of Haaland again this season. Pep Guardiola's goal machine shows no signs of slowing down. The hosts started brightly and had City on the back foot prior to Haaland's opener.

194,194,chelsea,2025-04-03,"Chelsea returned to the top four of the Premier League table as Enzo Fernandez's header sealed a 1-0 London derby win over Tottenham Hotspur. Fernandez powered home following an outstanding cross from the returning Cole Palmer in the 50th minute, as the Blues earned a deserved three points at Stamford Bridge. Moises Caicedo and Pape Sarr had second-half strikes disallowed, but Spurs could have few complaints about the result, having earlier relied on Guglielmo Vicario to keep Chelsea out. After several of their rivals for UEFA Champions League qualification won in midweek, the victory moves Chelsea to fourth place on 52 points, back above Manchester City and Newcastle United. How the match unfolded
Nicolas Jackson could have put Chelsea ahead in the first minute, but Vicario denied him with his legs before Micky van de Ven turned the loose ball against his own post. Vicario denied Palmer early in the second half, but that was a momentary reprieve for Spurs as Palmer drifted wide to cross, and Fernandez arrived unmarked to head home. Chelsea thought they had a second goal when Caicedo sent a thumping volley past Vicario, but the decision to award the goal was overturned following a VAR review, with Levi Colwill found to be offside in the build-up. Another VAR intervention went the other way, in favour of Caicedo, with 20 minutes to play. Spurs substitute Sarr rifled home from 25 yards out, but after a pitchside review, referee Craig Pawson ruled he had fouled the Chelsea midfielder. Spurs' best chance to level fell to Son late on, but he failed to beat Sanchez on the slide as Chelsea successfully navigated 12 minutes of second-half stoppage time. Palmer instigates Chelsea improvement
Chelsea went into the international break with three defeats in five Premier League games, and midweek wins for Nottingham Forest, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa did nothing to ease the pressure on the Blues. Enzo Maresca was boosted by the returns of Jackson and Palmer, but the latter was slow to get going in the first half, with his only major involvement coming when his inviting ball across the six-yard box was scrambled clear by Destiny Udogie. However, Palmer played a crucial role when Chelsea finally made their dominance count after half-time. Seconds after his 20-yard drive was parried by Vicario, Palmer received a simple pass from Marc Cucurella near the touchline and swung a magnificent cross onto the head of Fernandez, who could not miss. That assist was Palmer's first Premier League goal involvement since scoring in a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth in mid-January, eight games ago. Palmer's drop in form certainly did not help Chelsea's European aspirations, but after using the international break to recover and recharge, he will hope to get back to his best in the run-in. Spurs struggle again at Stamford Bridge
Spurs also received a major boost on the injury front. Having struggled with a hamstring injury, Van de Ven made his first Premier League start since the reverse fixture against Chelsea, a dramatic 4-3 defeat in December. Spurs seemed to lack physicality in midfield as Fernandez and Caicedo bossed proceedings, and only the reflexes of Vicario kept them level by the break. Things were not much better in attack, where former Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke was isolated and failed to attempt a single shot. James Maddison also struggled to have an influence and was withdrawn late on. Club reports

Spurs substitute Sarr rifled home from 25 yards out, but after a pitchside review, referee Craig Pawson ruled he had fouled the Chelsea midfielder. Spurs' best chance to level fell to Son late on, but he failed to beat Sanchez on the slide as Chelsea successfully navigated 12 minutes of second-half stoppage time. Enzo Maresca was boosted by the returns of Jackson and Palmer, but the latter was slow to get going in the first half, with his only major involvement coming when his inviting ball across the six-yard box was scrambled clear by Destiny Udogie. Spurs struggle again at Stamford Bridge
Spurs also received a major boost on the injury front. Having struggled with a hamstring injury, Van de Ven made his first Premier League start since the reverse fixture against Chelsea, a dramatic 4-3 defeat in December. Postecoglou has repeatedly talked up the importance of having first-choice centre-backs Van de Ven and Cristian Romero available, but they had little to no protection from their team-mates here. Spurs seemed to lack physicality in midfield as Fernandez and Caicedo bossed proceedings, and only the reflexes of Vicario kept them level by the break. James Maddison also struggled to have an influence and was withdrawn late on. It all amounted to another disjointed showing for Spurs, who have collected just 10 points since the turn of the year – only the bottom three teams have earned fewer. With Postecoglou forced to field more questions over his future this week, the pressure is firmly on. Spurs host Southampton on Sunday, before facing Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of a UEFA Europa League tie that could define their season. Club reports

Wood gave Forest an early lead, heading Elliot Anderson’s corner past Johnstone and into the bottom-right corner.

Forest continued their unbeaten start to the season, though they may be slightly frustrated at having to settle for a point against Midlands rivals Wolves, as head coach Nuno Espirito Santo was unable to claim victory over his former employers. After taking four points from six to start the season, there was an air of positivity around the City Ground ahead of kick-off. Forest got back on the front foot in the second half as Anthony Elanga, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Gibbs-White caused the visitors problems with their pace and movement, but they were unable to find a second goal. Midfielder Anderson also impressed, but it will be his midfield partner, Ibrahim Sangare, who Forest will be concerned about, after he was substituted with an injury early in the second half.

Wolves boss O’Neil was able to enjoy a far more resolute defensive display from his side than the one that was punished by six Chelsea goals last weekend. They showed a positive reaction from that Chelsea defeat inside two minutes as Rayan Ait-Nouri was played through by Cunha, but the full-back could not squeeze the ball through the legs of the goalkeeper from a tight angle. Wolves continue to face a run of tough fixtures to open the new season, but they have at least laid a foundation by taking a point from a tricky away match. Club reports

198,198,bournemouth,2025-04-02,"Ipswich Town secured their first league win of 2025 with a 2-1 victory over AFC Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Wednesday. Nathan Broadhead’s first Premier League goal put the visitors ahead in the 34th minute, just moments after Bournemouth had gone close at the other end. Bournemouth thought they had a penalty when Antoine Semenyo was brought down at the other end, but the on-field decision was overturned following a VAR review. Tenth-placed Bournemouth have now lost four of their last five league games, in a further blow to their European hopes, while 18th-placed Ipswich are nine points from safety. How the match unfolded
The Cherries have developed a reputation for racing out of the blocks this season, but they had to wait until the 32nd minute to register their first shot on target as Semenyo struck powerfully at Alex Palmer. Bournemouth thought they had a lifeline when Axel Tuanzebe brought down Semenyo on the edge of the area, but contact was deemed to have occurred outside the box. Andoni Iraola’s team pulled one back as Evanilson tucked home after Palmer parried Lewis Cook’s effort, but Bournemouth could not forge a comeback. Bournemouth’s stumble becomes a slump
Bournemouth would have hoped to bounce back strongly following their FA Cup elimination at the hands of Manchester City on Sunday, but their poor run of form persisted with another Premier League defeat. The Cherries have hit a rough patch in recent weeks, coming into this match with three losses in their last four league games after having lost just three of their previous 18 matches. The Cherries looked a shadow of themselves early on, with Ipswich controlling the tempo. And when Bournemouth finally did create those chances through Semenyo and Scott, they left the door open at the other end and were duly punished. Iraola now faces a crucial test to get his side back on track as Bournemouth travel to West Ham United on Saturday, with their European ambitions threatening to fall away. Not that the defence did not perform well – Palmer and O’Shea, in particular, made vital interventions to keep Bournemouth out before Evanilson got on the scoresheet. Club reports

Nathan Broadhead’s first Premier League goal put the visitors ahead in the 34th minute, just moments after Bournemouth had gone close at the other end. Liam Delap doubled Ipswich’s lead on the hour, combining brilliantly with Conor Townsend to lash home. Evanilson initiated hopes of a comeback when he pounced on a rebound in the 67th minute, but Ipswich held firm to claim just their fourth league win of the season. Tenth-placed Bournemouth have now lost four of their last five league games, in a further blow to their European hopes, while 18th-placed Ipswich are nine points from safety. Yet Ipswich raced down the other end to break the deadlock as Julio Enciso’s charging run set up Broadhead, who evaded Dean Huijsen’s sliding challenge and slotted home. Palmer made another fine save early in the second half but Ipswich doubled their lead when Delap played a smart one-two with Townsend and finished brilliantly. The Cherries looked a shadow of themselves early on, with Ipswich controlling the tempo. Tractor Boys show some grit
Ipswich’s three-month wait for a league victory came to an end, and though they are still well behind 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers, they showed they have some grit about them. They have stopped the rot, having lost four games on the bounce before this one, and Kieran McKenna’s team turned in some real moments of quality, too. Broadhead showed plenty of composure for his opener, and Delap’s thumping first-time finish for the second was a thing of beauty, too. McKenna’s team seem happier on the road than at home, and will not have given up hope of dragging themselves to safety despite the gap above them. A crucial clash with Wolves awaits this weekend — an opportunity McKenna will be desperate to seize. Club reports

200,200,aston-villa,2024-09-21,"Aston Villa forged another second-half comeback as they defeated Wolves 3-1 to continue their fine start to the Premier League season. Gary O’Neil’s men were much the better team throughout the first half at Villa Park, and took the lead through Matheus Cunha. But Villa, like they did against Everton last week, fought back and completed a superb turnaround. Ollie Watkins restored parity before Ezri Konsa finished smartly to give Unai Emery’s side the lead in the 88th minute. In-form Jhon Duran put the result beyond all doubt in injury time as Villa climbed into third place on 12 points, while winless Wolves slumped to the foot of the table. How the match unfolded
After a scrappy opening 25 minutes, Wolves made the breakthrough when Cunha intercepted a poor pass from Villa defender Diego Carlos before striking a fierce shot that beat Emiliano Martinez and went in via the post. Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone did not have a single save to make in the opening 45 minutes but Villa began to make inroads after the break, with Yerson Mosquera – who later needed to be taken off on a stretcher due to a head injury – clearing off the line from Watkins. Villa’s striker was not to be denied a second time, though, as he received a neat pass from Morgan Rodgers before his finish deflected in off Craig Dawson. The comeback was complete when Konsa flew in to meet Youri Tielemans’ cross, and there was further delight for the home faithful when Duran slotted into an empty net after more good work from Rodgers four minutes into 13 minutes of stoppage time. Villa roar back to recover from European hangover
It had been an emotional and demanding week for Emery’s men, following a 3-0 victory over Young Boys in their first match in Europe’s top club competition in four decades, and the death of much-loved former player Gary Shaw. Shaw was honoured before the match but Villa’s mid-week exploits were perhaps a major reason for a listless first-half display, in which they did not register a shot on target and ceded possession to Wolves consistently. Emery made changes at half-time, introducing Leon Bailey and Ian Maatsen, and the Jamaican proved a big difference down the right, stretching the game and proving to be a real outlet. Rogers and Watkins combined well for the equaliser, and Emery will be delighted to see Duran back on the scoresheet once again. Villa are flying high, level on points with Liverpool and Arsenal. Wolves wait for elusive first win
O’Neil wanted his side to channel the frustration from their opening four games into a good performance at Villa Park, and he was rewarded this with an excellent first half from his side. Despite their poor form heading into the encounter, with just one win in their last 14 league games stretching back to last season, Wolves were well-organised from the moment the match began, not allowing any Villa players much space to manoeuvre in the centre and limiting the attacking runs made from the likes of Watkins and Rogers.

But they struggled to contain the pair after the interval, and played most of the final 20 minutes in their own half, with the likes of Mario Lemina and Andre tiring in midfield, as their resistance was ultimately broken in the closing stages. Wolves, who will also have concerns over the extent of the damage suffered by Mosquera, will look for their first win of the season from their sixth attempt next week, as they host Liverpool next Saturday.

Jackson needed only 18 minutes to breach a porous West Ham defence twice, breaking in behind to produce two composed finishes and leave the hosts with a mountain to climb. Julen Lopetegui's team briefly improved before half-time but their hopes of a comeback were dashed almost immediately after the interval. West Ham's third successive home defeat leaves them in 14th spot ahead of Saturday's other fixtures, with four points from five matches under Lopetegui. How the match unfolded
Jackson caught West Ham cold with the opener inside four minutes, slotting his finish through Alphonse Areola's legs after being played in by Jadon Sancho, who was making his first Chelsea start after assisting Christopher Nkunku's winner at AFC Bournemouth last Sunday. West Ham thought they had one back with 32 minutes gone, but Mohammed Kudus strayed offside before finding the bottom-left corner, with the on-field decision to disallow the goal confirmed by the VAR. Noni Madueke should have added a fourth when West Ham were caught short on the break again on the hour, but Areola was able to parry his low drive. Areola was called upon again to prevent further damage with 15 minutes to play, making a stunning reflex save to keep out Nkunku's header, but that could not put a dampener on an enjoyable outing for Chelsea. For that, he had Jackson and Sancho to thank, the duo dovetailing brilliantly in the early stages as the Blues cut through West Ham time and again. Jackson displayed rapid thinking in the build-up to his opener, taking a quick free-kick in midfield with the Hammers napping, then playing one-twos with both Enzo Fernandez and Sancho before finishing neatly. Lopetegui's slow start continues
With Aston Villa, Man City and Chelsea the opponents for West Ham's first three home matches of 2024/25, Lopetegui may not have expected a flying start to his tenure at the London Stadium. However, the Spaniard has now suffered the ignominy of becoming the first West Ham manager in history to oversee three straight home defeats to start a league campaign. The nature of Saturday's loss will surely concern Lopetegui, whose decision to have Edson Alvarez drop into a centre-back position when Chelsea had possession allowed them to pick West Ham's undermanned midfield apart with ease early on. Just 38 minutes had gone when Lopetegui sacrificed Guido Rodriguez to introduce Tomas Soucek, but by that point, much of the damage had already been done. With another London derby at Brentford next up for his men, Lopetegui will be demanding major improvements. Club reports

Jackson caught West Ham cold with the opener inside four minutes, slotting his finish through Alphonse Areola's legs after being played in by Jadon Sancho, who was making his first Chelsea start after assisting Christopher Nkunku's winner at AFC Bournemouth last Sunday. Fourteen minutes later, Jackson had his and Chelsea's second, finishing with the outside of his boot after receiving a pinpoint through-ball from Moises Caicedo. Chelsea started the second half even faster than they began the first, with Jackson slicing through the hosts then teeing up Palmer to find the goal with a near-post finish just 68 seconds after the restart. Areola was called upon again to prevent further damage with 15 minutes to play, making a stunning reflex save to keep out Nkunku's header, but that could not put a dampener on an enjoyable outing for Chelsea. Jackson and Sancho leading new-look Chelsea
Much was made of Chelsea's choice to double down on their busy approach to recruitment in the recent transfer window, but there have already been positive signs under Maresca, whose only defeat at the helm came against champions Manchester City on the opening matchday. For that, he had Jackson and Sancho to thank, the duo dovetailing brilliantly in the early stages as the Blues cut through West Ham time and again. Jackson displayed rapid thinking in the build-up to his opener, taking a quick free-kick in midfield with the Hammers napping, then playing one-twos with both Enzo Fernandez and Sancho before finishing neatly. Another predatory finish brought up his fourth Premier League goal of the season and he added an assist for Palmer's strike after the break. Sancho was a constant threat on the Blues' left, showing the self-confidence and incision that evaded him in three difficult years with Manchester United. Maresca has plenty of attacking options to call upon as he oversees Chelsea's latest rebuild, but Jackson and Sancho have wasted no time in staking their claims for key roles in the Blues' new era. Lopetegui's slow start continues

Raul Jimenez scored the opening goal after five minutes before Emile Smith Rowe doubled Fulham’s lead on 22 minutes. Fulham climb to eighth in the Premier League table, while Newcastle drop to sixth after their first defeat of the season. Fulham nearly gifted Newcastle an equaliser when Bernd Leno presented Fabian Schar with the ball from a goal-kick but the defender failed to punish the goalkeeper, shooting wide. Ruthless Cottagers show game management
Marco Silva did not want to see a repeat of last weekend when Danny Ings netted a 95th-minute equaliser to deny Fulham a deserved three points against West Ham. Fulham were again put in the same position against Newcastle, with a goal advantage heading into the final stages of the match but this time they showed the game management required to keep their opponents at bay, aided by a late Nelson strike. Silva also kept trust in Jimenez from the start to lead the line over Rodrigo Muniz and that decision paid off almost instantly when he produced a clever turn and precise finish to fire Fulham ahead. The Mexican looks like he has his confidence back after two goals in successive matches, which will delight Silva as he looks to propel the Cottagers up the table. Fulham have shown a lack of ruthlessness at times this season, but Smith Rowe managed to double their advantage in the first half to get that crucial second goal. The quality of the goal will please Silva after Smith Rowe finished a free-flowing move and played a neat one-two with Alex Iwobi. They then showed a different side to their game in the second half to keep Newcastle at bay to secure the victory and increase the positive mood currently around Craven Cottage. Fulham punished them just 44 seconds later when Jimenez scored the opening goal. Newcastle did have chances to equalise as Leno denied Anthony Gordon and Murphy curled a shot over from a good position before Schar failed to capitalise on a mistake from the goalkeeper.

Shortly after Joelinton had a goal disallowed for Newcastle at one end, the hosts took the lead at the other on five minutes when Jimenez chested down Adama Traore’s cross and turned to fire a shot low into the net. Newcastle though were indebted to Nick Pope for denying Traore at his near post with his legs before he leapt across to beat away Joachim Andersen’s long-range effort. After half-time, Newcastle came out the blocks quickly and Barnes found the bottom corner to help produce a keenly contested second half. Fulham nearly gifted Newcastle an equaliser when Bernd Leno presented Fabian Schar with the ball from a goal-kick but the defender failed to punish the goalkeeper, shooting wide. Fulham were again put in the same position against Newcastle, with a goal advantage heading into the final stages of the match but this time they showed the game management required to keep their opponents at bay, aided by a late Nelson strike. They then showed a different side to their game in the second half to keep Newcastle at bay to secure the victory and increase the positive mood currently around Craven Cottage. Howe substitutions nearly pay off again
After an unbeaten start to the season, this was a disappointing afternoon in the capital for Newcastle, who could have gone top of the Premier League table with victory. Joe Willock was judged offside when he was found inside the penalty area before he laid the ball across to Joelinton to strike home off the underside of the crossbar. The hosts’ pressure continued, and Newcastle struggled to keep possession and soon found themselves 2-0 behind when Pope should have kept out Smith Rowe’s effort. Like in previous matches, Eddie Howe looked to his bench at half-time as Jacob Murphy and Lewis Hall replaced Lloyd Kelly and Willock. Newcastle did have chances to equalise as Leno denied Anthony Gordon and Murphy curled a shot over from a good position before Schar failed to capitalise on a mistake from the goalkeeper.

206,206,brighton-and-hove-albion,2025-04-02,"Marcus Rashford netted his first Premier League goal for Aston Villa as they beat fellow UEFA Champions League hopefuls Brighton & Hove Albion 3-0 at Amex Stadium. Both teams had penalty appeals waved away in a first half in which Yasin Ayari hit a post, while Simon Adingra had a goal disallowed for Brighton, who drop to eighth. Villa leapfrog Brighton into seventh place with this victory and remain three points behind Manchester City, who are now fourth. Adingra whistled one wide from the edge of the box at the other end, while Kaoru Mitoma had a penalty shout overlooked following a tussle with Cash. Brighton thought they had a swift response through Adingra, but Attwell disallowed the goal for handball against Mitoma after a VAR review. Hurzeler frustrated as big calls escape Brighton
In a game of two extremely technical sides, it is perhaps no surprise that it was decided on the finest of margins. Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler will be feeling that, on this occasion, those margins just simply did not favour his side – who for the most part you could argue were the better team. On another day, Mitoma may have earned a penalty for a nudge from Cash when brilliantly taking Lewis Dunk's pinpoint long ball in his stride. The Brighton head coach's mood would hardly have been improved by the static nature of his side's defending for Rashford's goal, and when Adingra's effort was chalked off, then Hurzeler might have been thinking he had wronged the footballing gods. But, whatever the context, this will feel like a match that slipped through Brighton's grasp, particularly with the race for Champions League football so mouth-wateringly congested. It actually came from a Brighton corner, with Emiliano Martinez swiftly finding Rogers, whose ball was pretty central and allowed Verbruggen little time to set as Rashford's pace caused chaos. Emery was a mightily relieved man shortly after when Martinez made a complete hash of collecting the ball from Mitoma's knockdown, parrying it straight into the path of Adingra. The relief was also palpable for the goalkeeper when Mitoma was deemed to have handled the ball. Club reports

207,207,aston-villa,2025-04-02,"Marcus Rashford netted his first Premier League goal for Aston Villa as they beat fellow UEFA Champions League hopefuls Brighton & Hove Albion 3-0 at Amex Stadium. Marco Asensio added a second goal with a cool finish in the 78th minute and fellow substitute Donyell Malen rounded off an incident-packed game deep in stoppage time, with his first Villa strike since joining the club in January. Villa leapfrog Brighton into seventh place with this victory and remain three points behind Manchester City, who are now fourth. The gap to fifth – which could be enough to guarantee Champions League qualification – is just two points for Unai Emery's side. How the match unfolded
Rashford skewed wide after expertly taking down Boubacar Kamara's long ball and Matty Cash arrowed a fine half-volley past the left post in a bright Villa start. Villa made the breakthrough after 51 minutes when Rashford raced on to Rogers' long punt and finished beyond Bart Verbruggen. And the visitors added further gloss late on – Malen grabbing his first Villa goal with an arrowed finish. Rashford revival in full swing as Villa eye Europe once more
First scorer Rashford has looked like a player rejuvenated during his loan spell at Villa and he scored his first goals for the club in their 3-0 win at Preston North End in the FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday. And his first strike in the Premier League for Villa was right out of his textbook. It actually came from a Brighton corner, with Emiliano Martinez swiftly finding Rogers, whose ball was pretty central and allowed Verbruggen little time to set as Rashford's pace caused chaos. Emery was a mightily relieved man shortly after when Martinez made a complete hash of collecting the ball from Mitoma's knockdown, parrying it straight into the path of Adingra. While Emery would not have enjoyed that moment of indecision, he will have very much enjoyed Rashford's contribution to the cause. But if Emery can keep Rashford in this sort of lively form then he has an absolutely superb asset in the quest to ensure Champions League football via their Premier League placing – while they can, of course, still achieve that by winning Europe's elite competition this season.

Leicester – who have only managed to collect one point from their opening three Premier League fixtures – faced an Unai Emery side who were in no mood to be charitable at the King Power Stadium. Leicester pushed for an equaliser but Villa secured a hard-fought win that sees them move up to sixth position on six points ahead of the international break, with the Foxes still waiting for a first win since promotion. A frantic and high-tempo start to the match saw the Leicester players react to a boisterous home crowd with plenty of aggression and pressing, but Villa quickly found their feet and Ollie Watkins spurned a couple of early presentable opportunities. Youri Tielemans stepped up to take a free-kick, sliding a pass down the right-hand side of Leicester’s defensive wall for a sprinting Jacob Ramsey – on as an early substitute for the injured Leon Bailey – to square across the box via Watkins for Onana to tap home. Villa thought they had the match wrapped up when Duran – arching his neck – looped an impressive header over Mads Hermansen after full-back Digne found him with a whipped cross from the left. But Leicester found a threat through the introduction of Stephy Mavididi, who helped to set up fellow substitute Buonanotte with 17 minutes left. Leicester edged out again as tough start goes on
Leicester were once again competitive and played their part in an entertaining encounter, but they are short of points despite a spirited late revival. Jamie Vardy ran his heart out but was starved of service against Villa, touching the ball just twice in the opposition box during a first half that saw the visitors dominate. Cooper needs to find a way of getting his strikers more service, though he will be pleased with the impact of substitutes Mavididi and Buonanotte who combined to give them hope. They had too much quality for a Leicester side who struggled to live with them when they moved the ball quickly across their front line. The strong performances of Morgan Rogers, Onana and ex-Leicester midfielder Tielemans, combined the potency of players like Duran, overwhelmed a plucky Leicester effort. Club reports

Leicester – who have only managed to collect one point from their opening three Premier League fixtures – faced an Unai Emery side who were in no mood to be charitable at the King Power Stadium. Villa doubled their lead after the break when Duran made an immediate impact from the bench, heading in beautifully from Lucas Digne’s centre, but Steve Cooper’s men were not done yet and a substitute of their own, Facundo Buonanotte, slammed in from close range to set up a nervy finish. Leicester pushed for an equaliser but Villa secured a hard-fought win that sees them move up to sixth position on six points ahead of the international break, with the Foxes still waiting for a first win since promotion. A frantic and high-tempo start to the match saw the Leicester players react to a boisterous home crowd with plenty of aggression and pressing, but Villa quickly found their feet and Ollie Watkins spurned a couple of early presentable opportunities.

Youri Tielemans stepped up to take a free-kick, sliding a pass down the right-hand side of Leicester’s defensive wall for a sprinting Jacob Ramsey – on as an early substitute for the injured Leon Bailey – to square across the box via Watkins for Onana to tap home. Emery’s side assumed an element of control for the remainder of the first half, but a close-range Caleb Okoli effort that was clawed away by Emiliano Martinez reminded the visitors they were still in a match. Villa thought they had the match wrapped up when Duran – arching his neck – looped an impressive header over Mads Hermansen after full-back Digne found him with a whipped cross from the left. There is no doubt that their start to life in the Premier League has not been the kindest, having played two of last season’s top five, Tottenham Hotspur and Villa, in their first two home matches. Jamie Vardy ran his heart out but was starved of service against Villa, touching the ball just twice in the opposition box during a first half that saw the visitors dominate. Duran strikes again as Watkins drought continues
Watkins saw his goal drought continue, but an inspired change from Emery showed the depth Villa possess in their ranks, as he was replaced by match-winner Duran, exactly as happened against West Ham United in their opening match. Watkins has now gone eight matches without registering a league goal for Villa, his worst run under Emery, but in the end it was not costly as the visitors held on for all three points and a valuable win to bounce back from the loss to Arsenal, capping an exciting week where they also discovered their upcoming UEFA Champions League opponents. Villa have now won two of their three Premier League matches and look in fine form as they hope for another successful campaign, and there is a reasonable fixture list to look forward to after the international break, with encounters against Everton, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town up next.

210,210,manchester-city,2025-04-02,"Jack Grealish scored his first Premier League goal in almost 16 months as Manchester City moved up to fourth in the table with a 2-0 victory over Leicester City. Man City will be without Erling Haaland for up to seven weeks due to an ankle injury, but the absence of their leading goalscorer proved only a minor inconvenience on Wednesday night. Man City were unable to further extend their lead despite dominating throughout, but the victory takes them above Chelsea, who face Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday. How the match unfolded
Man City needed less than two minutes to go ahead. Following Jeremy Doku's driving run, Savinho's intelligent cutback found Grealish, and he side-footed home. Bilal El Khannouss curled just wide to cap a rare Leicester foray, but City scored their second goal in the 29th minute. City continued to monopolise possession after the break, with talented youngster Nico O'Reilly seeing an outside-of-the-boot attempt blocked by Faes. Marmoush perhaps should have put City 3-0 up when he turned Doku's cutback over on the hour mark, but for the most part the hosts were content to simply play in front of Leicester. It all amounted to a routine success for Pep Guardiola's team, who avoided a slip-up in the race for UEFA Champions League qualification. Man City share the load
With Haaland likely to miss at least four more Premier League games with the ankle injury he suffered in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth, several Man City attackers have a chance to stake a claim for a regular starting spot. Since Haaland arrived in 2022, City had only lost two of the 15 league matches that he had missed, so they have shown an ability to cope without him. Marmoush led the line here, and he followed up his winner at Vitality Stadium with a crashing finish to put City two goals up – his fifth goal in eight Premier League games. He repaid Guardiola's faith with his first goal in the competition in over a year, lpreviously netting in a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace in December 2023. Another positive was O'Reilly making his first Premier League start, and the 20-year-old produced a composed performance just three days after assisting both goals in Man City's quarter-final triumph. City still have plenty to play for in the league and the cup, so Guardiola will be delighted to see some members of his supporting cast step up. Toothless Foxes beaten again
A trip to the Etihad Stadium always appeared a daunting prospect for Leicester, who had lost 13 of their last 14 Premier League games and fell 12 points adrift of the dotted line when Wolves beat West Ham United 1-0 on Tuesday. Although losing to City is no disgrace, Van Nistelrooy will not have been pleased about the meek manner of their defeat, conceding after just 109 seconds and failing to lay a glove on their hosts thereafter.

Leicester remain 19th, 12 points adrift of 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers, with just eight games remaining. Bilal El Khannouss curled just wide to cap a rare Leicester foray, but City scored their second goal in the 29th minute. A calamitous mix-up between Mads Hermansen and Wout Faes saw the ball drop straight to Marmoush, who rifled a shot off the woodwork and in. Hermansen earned a measure of redemption by turning Savinho's strike over the crossbar seven minutes later as the Foxes made it to half-time without suffering further damage. Marmoush perhaps should have put City 3-0 up when he turned Doku's cutback over on the hour mark, but for the most part the hosts were content to simply play in front of Leicester. Toothless Foxes beaten again
A trip to the Etihad Stadium always appeared a daunting prospect for Leicester, who had lost 13 of their last 14 Premier League games and fell 12 points adrift of the dotted line when Wolves beat West Ham United 1-0 on Tuesday. But boss Ruud van Nistelrooy remained bullish in the build-up to the game, insisting the Foxes would not go down without a fight. When captain Jamie Vardy was replaced by Oliver Skipp in a defensive half-time change, it was clear the visitors were playing a game of damage limitation. Vardy only had eight touches before coming off, as he failed to make his mark. El Khannouss's early curler was one of just two shots attempted by Leicester, and they have now lost their last seven Premier League games in a row, all to nil. Things may not get any easier for Leicester, either, with their next three fixtures pitting them against Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Liverpool. Club reports

The Portuguese forward netted his first league goal since the opening weekend after just nine minutes at Selhurst Park, darting in behind to pick out the bottom-left corner. It could have been a different story, though, as Palace attacker Eddie Nketiah had a goal ruled out for offside inside the first minute. A sixth victory from seven matches moves Arne Slot’s men four points clear at the top of the table before title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City play later on Saturday, while Palace remain without a win in 18th. How the match unfolded
Just 22 seconds were on the clock when Palace had the ball in the net after Nketiah latched onto Ismaila Sarr’s low cross to dink Alisson, but he had strayed offside. Henderson then tipped Trent Alexander-Arnold’s low drive wide before Palace almost equalised on the stroke of half-time, Alisson getting down sharply to push Sarr’s low drive away. Palace soon asserted themselves into the match though, with Alisson having to make a trio of saves in quick succession to keep out Nketiah, Eberechi Eze and Chalobah to protect the clean sheet. The Brazilian was forced off through injury in the final 15 minutes, but Will Hughes and Eze could not beat replacement Vitezslav Jaros, on for his debut, with their long-range efforts. The wait goes on
It was always going to be a tough task for Palace if they wanted to get their first win of the Premier League season against high-flying Liverpool, though you could not fault the fans for having hope after beating the Reds at Anfield towards the end of last season. The celebrations may have been cut short after Nketiah’s very early disallowed goal, but the moment showed Palace were capable of causing their in-form visitors problems. But Palace looked more settled after a double change in the second half saw them switch formation, with the introduction of Jean-Philippe Mateta also providing them with another focal point up top. It is no surprise that their best chances came after Oliver Glasner’s tactical switch, but even with the small boost given by Alisson’s departure, they still could not find a way past Jaros, who had a calm presence after his unexpected introduction. Palace remain in the relegation zone heading into the international break, but their manager will already be thinking ahead to a pivotal trip to Nottingham Forest as they await their first three points. Van Dijk was assured, easily reading Palace’s attempts to play in behind to sweep the danger away, while Ibrahima Konate took the more proactive approach on the press as part of an impressive defence that has still only conceded two goals. It was Ryan Gravenberch who once again dictated play for the Reds though, orchestrating attacks from midfield and giving Palace a headache as he linked everything together. Club reports

The Eagles pushed hard for an equaliser but could not breach Liverpool’s backline despite generating a late flurry of chances. A sixth victory from seven matches moves Arne Slot’s men four points clear at the top of the table before title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City play later on Saturday, while Palace remain without a win in 18th. And they soon found themselves behind, as Jota darted in front of Trevoh Chalobah to poke Cody Gakpo’s cross past Dean Henderson, marking his 100th Liverpool start with a goal. Henderson then tipped Trent Alexander-Arnold’s low drive wide before Palace almost equalised on the stroke of half-time, Alisson getting down sharply to push Sarr’s low drive away. Mohamed Salah looked set to get a customary away goal this season, peeling off his marker to chest down Virgil van Dijk’s floated pass, but Henderson rushed off his line to smother his close-range effort. The wait goes on
It was always going to be a tough task for Palace if they wanted to get their first win of the Premier League season against high-flying Liverpool, though you could not fault the fans for having hope after beating the Reds at Anfield towards the end of last season. However, as Liverpool dominated possession in the first half, the hosts were stifled, struggling to make any sort of impact in the final third. A steady presence
Seven games into the Premier League season and it looks like Slot has seamlessly settled into life on Merseyside, having only had one minor blip so far in a defeat to Forest at Anfield. Despite the early scare from Nketiah, Liverpool showed their trademark calm under the Dutchman as they soon took control of the contest. Van Dijk was assured, easily reading Palace’s attempts to play in behind to sweep the danger away, while Ibrahima Konate took the more proactive approach on the press as part of an impressive defence that has still only conceded two goals. It was Ryan Gravenberch who once again dictated play for the Reds though, orchestrating attacks from midfield and giving Palace a headache as he linked everything together. With big matches ahead, one worry for Slot will be the muscle injury to Alisson, who cut a frustrated figure when he threw his gloves to the floor as he was forced off late in the game. Slot may not believe his team are ready to be included among the title contenders just yet, but they have laid down some impressive groundwork to go into the international break top of the league. When top-flight football resumes, the Reds have an enormous double-header against Chelsea and Arsenal which could provide an indication as to how much staying power they are likely to have.

214,214,brighton-and-hove-albion,2024-09-22,"Brighton and Nottingham Forest preserved their unbeaten starts to the Premier League season in an enthralling 2-2 draw that featured THREE red cards. The pair, along with Manchester City and Arsenal before their meeting later on Sunday, remain as the only sides undefeated in the competition this season after an end-to-end affair at the Amex Stadium. Referee Robert Jones issued a second yellow card to Gibbs-White for a reckless challenge on Brighton substitute Joao Pedro. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler and Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo were then both sent off for unacceptable technical-area behaviour following the incident. The chaotic draw leaves Hurzeler's Seagulls in seventh, one place ahead of Forest after the pair both made it five matches unbeaten. How the match unfolded
A clumsy challenge from Carlos Baleba on Callum Hudson-Odoi handed Forest an early penalty, which Wood converted with ease as Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen went the wrong way. Forest managed to nullify Brighton, until Jan Paul van Hecke's delightful right-wing cross found Hinshelwood, who expertly redirected into the top-right corner in the 42nd minute. The turnaround was complete just three minutes later when Ola Aina needlessly felled the marauding Kaoru Mitoma, allowing Welbeck to whip a deadly free-kick into the bottom-right corner. Welbeck passed up a brilliant opening to extend Brighton's lead as Matz Sels made a reflex save early in the second half, and that stop proved pivotal when Gibbs-White slotted through for Jota Silva, who offloaded for Sosa to tap into an empty net. Gibbs-White's brilliance was overshadowed by a reckless lunge on Joao Pedro late on, with the Forest midfielder picking up his second yellow card before tensions boiled over on the touchline as both coaches were also sent off. Stylish Seagulls go unrewarded
It will be scant consolation after throwing away the lead, but Brighton have now managed to go five matches unbeaten to start a top-flight season for the first time in their history. The Seagulls have done so while further evolving their possession-focused style under Hurzeler, though his side showed they are by no means limited to one way of playing on Sunday. Directness was key again for the hosts' second goal, Mitoma bursting inside with his dazzling feet before Aina's late lunge paved the way for Welbeck's 70th Premier League goal. Lewis Dunk's late cross almost caught Sels out, though Hurzeler's side could not find a late winner after being pegged back by Sosa, with more killer instinct needed when they travel to Chelsea next. Gibbs-White shot straight at Verbruggen as the away side failed to make the most of their counter-attacking chances, and those missed opportunities seemed set to haunt Forest when Brighton's quickfire double put them behind. Yet Nuno acted swiftly, sending on three half-time substitutes and moving Aina from right-back to the left-hand side, either to protect that flank or get the defender away from the energetic Mitoma.

215,215,nottingham-forest,2024-09-22,"Brighton and Nottingham Forest preserved their unbeaten starts to the Premier League season in an enthralling 2-2 draw that featured THREE red cards. Referee Robert Jones issued a second yellow card to Gibbs-White for a reckless challenge on Brighton substitute Joao Pedro. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler and Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo were then both sent off for unacceptable technical-area behaviour following the incident. The chaotic draw leaves Hurzeler's Seagulls in seventh, one place ahead of Forest after the pair both made it five matches unbeaten. How the match unfolded
A clumsy challenge from Carlos Baleba on Callum Hudson-Odoi handed Forest an early penalty, which Wood converted with ease as Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen went the wrong way. Forest managed to nullify Brighton, until Jan Paul van Hecke's delightful right-wing cross found Hinshelwood, who expertly redirected into the top-right corner in the 42nd minute. Welbeck passed up a brilliant opening to extend Brighton's lead as Matz Sels made a reflex save early in the second half, and that stop proved pivotal when Gibbs-White slotted through for Jota Silva, who offloaded for Sosa to tap into an empty net. Gibbs-White's brilliance was overshadowed by a reckless lunge on Joao Pedro late on, with the Forest midfielder picking up his second yellow card before tensions boiled over on the touchline as both coaches were also sent off. However, with the Forest defence showing resilience, it was an unfamiliar method that proved fruitful when Van Hecke found acres of space to float a cross in for a late charge from scorer Hinshelwood. Nuno's tweaks pay dividends
An impressive 1-0 victory away to Liverpool last weekend was Forest's fourth straight match when only scoring once in the league, and they managed their customary goal again here when Hudson-Odoi drew a foul from Baleba for Wood's well-taken penalty. Gibbs-White shot straight at Verbruggen as the away side failed to make the most of their counter-attacking chances, and those missed opportunities seemed set to haunt Forest when Brighton's quickfire double put them behind. Yet Nuno acted swiftly, sending on three half-time substitutes and moving Aina from right-back to the left-hand side, either to protect that flank or get the defender away from the energetic Mitoma. Silva was one of those to come on at the break, repaying Nuno's faith when racing onto Gibbs-White's through-ball before sliding across a tap-in for Sosa, who also was introduced in the second half. Though Nuno will be suspended when Fulham visit the City Ground next week, the Portuguese boss is proving Forest have the flexibility – and quality – to continue their strong start.",Nott'm Forest_2024-09-22,brighton-and-hove-albion,nuno-espirito-santo,fabian-hurzeler,2,2,5,3,0,30,1.42,2,4,1,1,11,245,18,11,6,1,3,0,0,1,4,0,0,1,14,1,4,169,16,44,14,0,48,9,35,10,8,18,8,34,48,0,1,-0.9058,0,0,12,70,1.0,2,14,2,9,12,542,12,11,3,0,3,0,4,7,8,6,1,0,31,3,0,475,25,64,17,0,52,11,31,18,10,12,7,39,9,0,2,-0.3173,0,1,1
216,216,manchester-city,2024-09-22,"John Stones scored a last-gasp equaliser as Premier League title rivals Manchester City and 10-man Arsenal drew 2-2 in a thrilling, fiery encounter at the Etihad Stadium. The Gunners looked all set to claim a statement win on Sunday, until City substitute Stones finished from point-blank range deep into second-half stoppage time. Erling Haaland’s 100th City goal handed the hosts a deserved advantage early on, only for Riccardo Calafiori and Gabriel Magalhaes to give the Gunners a half-time lead. For the majority of the second half, it looked as though City would not be able to make their numerical advantage count, with David Raya on top form in Arsenal’s goal. Yet Raya was finally beaten when Stones latched onto a rebound six yards out, with City claiming a potentially vital point that sent them back to the top pf the table, while Arsenal are fourth. How the match unfolded
Haaland needed just nine minutes to net his landmark strike on his 105th City appearance, bursting through the Gunners defence and prodding brilliantly beyond Raya after Savinho’s neat turn and pass. A serious-looking injury for Rodri gave City cause for concern, though, and Arsenal were level less than a minute later when Calafiori curled in a sensational left-footed effort. But Man City could find no way through, with Haaland and Josko Gvardiol coming closest to beating Raya. That was until the 98th minute, when City’s pressure finally told – Mateo Kovacic’s strike deflecting into the path of Stones, who sent the home crowd into raptures. City overcome Rodri blow… just about
Much has been made for City’s ability to operate without Rodri within their ranks, having lost four of the nine matches in all competitions without their star midfielder last season, while only being defeated once in the 50 matches he featured in. After being welcomed into the heavyweight clash with a body blow from Kai Havertz in the opening seconds, Rodri – making his first league start of the season – was forced to withdraw after a tangle in the box with Thomas Partey that saw the Spaniard worryingly clutch his right knee. City’s frustration was further compounded when Calafiori’s long-range stunner levelled the scores, though they were complaints from the hosts, most notably from Walker, with Arsenal having taken a free-kick quickly, and Walker claimed he was out of position after he was called over to speak to referee Michael Oliver. While Trossard’s red card offered the hosts a way back into the match, City’s slick attacking football was met with Arsenal’s stern defensive rearguard, only for the kind of goal to not usually be associated with a Guardiola team to prove decisive. Stones’ leveller was anything but pretty, but it could prove pivotal even at this early stage of the campaign. So close, but so far for Arsenal
Having shown glimpses of their attacking talents in the first half, it was Arsenal’s defensive resolve that shone through in a second, and it almost saw them withstand an endless wave of City pressure. The Gunners were camped in their own half after the break – and mostly in their own box – but their solid backline, which conceded the fewest goals in the division last season, restricted City to efforts from distance for the majority.

218,218,newcastle-united,2025-04-02,"Sandro Tonali's remarkable cross-shot was the difference as Newcastle United beat Brentford 2-1 at St. Alexander Isak had earlier given his side the lead on the stroke of half-time after an underwhelming opening period, poking in Jacob Murphy's cross. Tonali then struck the winner to lift Eddie Howe's side into fifth with Leicester City up next. How the match unfolded
An uneventful first half saw both sides struggle to muster much quality, Isak going close when he planted a close-range header wide from Tino Livramento's cross after just two minutes. Harvey Barnes whipped a shot wide and was then flagged offside after putting the ball in the net – a decision confirmed by the VAR – but just as a half-time stalemate seemed inevitable, Murphy dug out an excellent delivery and Isak capitalised on Mbeumo's slip to prod his side ahead. Murphy and Barnes fluffed second-half chances, but Brentford grew in confidence and drew level after 66 minutes, Mbeumo sending Pope the wrong way from 12 yards after the Newcastle goalkeeper had brought down Wissa inside the box. Two minutes later, the Bees were almost in front when Pinnock's header hit the inside of the post as Brentford looked to take advantage of Newcastle's tiring legs. Howe's side were able to ride the wave of pressure from their opponents and stole the points when Tonali struck a stunning effort from the touchline that Flekken could not keep out. Magpies build on EFL Cup victory
Newcastle did not hit the same heights as they did at Wembley Stadium against Liverpool in their EFL Cup final win, but Howe won't lose too much sleep over that, as his side inch ever close to UEFA Champions League qualification. Isak, who scored in their clash with Arne Slot’s side last month to seal their first major trophy in 70 years, also did his thing in attack, despite having missed a couple of opportunities before eventually breaking the deadlock in first-half stoppage time. Isak has now scored in six of his side's last eight home league matches, five of which have been converted into victories. Should that run continue and propel the Magpies into the Champions League, it would also give his club the best possible chance of keeping hold of him next season. The only three points they have taken against teams above that was the reverse fixture against Newcastle, which they won 4-2.",Newcastle_2025-04-02,brentford,eddie-howe,thomas-frank,2,1,30,1,1,48,1.29,2,21,2,4,12,402,21,12,1,0,4,0,9,8,15,6,1,0,34,0,2,304,24,62,13,0,54,8,42,15,10,21,7,52,32,0,2,0.2776,0,2,2,52,1.6,2,12,2,5,12,427,11,11,1,0,3,1,3,6,10,2,1,0,37,2,0,329,13,67,36,0,46,6,31,17,9,11,7,55,20,4,2,-0.4043,0,1,12

Bryan Mbeumo equalised from the spot midway through the second half after Nick Pope brought down Yoanne Wissa, before Ethan Pinnock hit the post. Brentford, meanwhile, stay 11th and take on Chelsea this Sunday.

Brentford hit their ceiling again
Much has been made of the contrast between Brentford's home and away form this season, but the secret behind their inconsistency really seems to be the quality of their opposition. The Bees now sit 11th having won 12 Premier League matches this season, with nine of those victories coming against teams below them and another two coming against 10th-placed AFC Bournemouth. They will rue Pinnock's near miss when they had the upper hand after Mbeumo's equaliser at St. For Thomas Frank, it was the latest reminder of why they have struggled to bridge the gap to the teams chasing European qualification.",Brentford_2025-04-02,newcastle-united,thomas-frank,eddie-howe,1,2,30,1,0,52,1.6,2,12,2,5,12,427,11,11,1,0,3,1,3,6,10,2,1,0,37,2,0,329,13,67,36,0,46,6,31,17,9,11,7,55,20,4,2,-0.4043,0,1,12,48,1.29,2,21,2,4,12,402,21,12,1,0,4,0,9,8,15,6,1,0,34,0,2,304,24,62,13,0,54,8,42,15,10,21,7,52,32,0,2,0.2776,0,2,2

Ange Postecoglou's side had won their last five games in all competitions and came flying out the blocks at the Amex Stadium as in-form Brennan Johnson scored for a sixth straight outing. Maddison saw a 21st-minute finish ruled out for an earlier offside against Pedro Porro, though there was no denying the visitors two minutes later when Dominic Solanke's well-weighted pass teed up Johnson's sweeping left-footed strike. An error at the other end offered Brighton hope when Udogie made a mess of clearing Kaoru Mitoma's left-wing delivery, with Minteh slamming in from close range on 48 minutes. The hosts were back on level terms 10 minutes later when Mitoma’s delicate through-ball freed Rutter, who danced around two Tottenham defenders before firing a low left-footed finish past the helpless Guglielmo Vicario. And Rutter proved the difference for Brighton’s winner, battling to the byline past three Spurs defenders before lunging to lift a cross, which looped up off Rodrigo Bentancur, towards the six-yard box, where Welbeck was waiting to cap off a stunning comeback win. Attacking brilliance masks Brighton's high-line issues
Hurzeler made a great start, with back-to-back victories over Everton and Manchester United in his first two games in charge, but a four-game winless run in the league brought questions heading into this contest. Brighton's insistence on playing a high line was exposed in a 4-2 thrashing by Chelsea last time out, and the same strategy posed further issues in a one-sided first half. Further joy followed down that same side as Mitoma, who also created a glorious chance for Welbeck in the first half, then tested the hands of Vicario with a low drive. It was Mitoma again who smartly ghosted into an inside pocket of space before sliding through for Rutter, who made the most out of a half-chance to punish Spurs' fragile defence. Hurzeler will know his team are by no means the finished article, with numerous concerns at the back, though Rutter and Mitoma's attacking brilliance will have Brighton hopeful of further climbing the table when they visit Newcastle United after the international break. Werner burst through Brighton's high line before his sliding across evaded the stretch of Johnson after less than a minute – and that was a sign of things to come. Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski were both denied by fine blocks in the early stages, too, before Solanke showed brilliant intelligence to drop deep and play through both Brighton's centre-backs to tee up Johnson's opener.

221,221,tottenham-hotspur,2024-10-06,"Brighton & Hove Albion produced a remarkable second-half comeback as Georginio Rutter scored one and helped set up another in a THRILLING 3-2 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Ange Postecoglou's side had won their last five games in all competitions and came flying out the blocks at the Amex Stadium as in-form Brennan Johnson scored for a sixth straight outing. James Maddison doubled the visitors' lead before the break, helped by Bart Verbruggen's poor handling, but Yankuba Minteh halved that deficit after the restart. Rutter restored parity prior to the hour mark before edging past numerous Tottenham defenders, with his cross deflecting up for Danny Welbeck to head in and seal a memorable turnaround. Verbruggen was still required to deny Destiny Udogie late on, however, as Fabian Hurzeler's side held on for a victory that lifted them to sixth, three places above Spurs. Maddison saw a 21st-minute finish ruled out for an earlier offside against Pedro Porro, though there was no denying the visitors two minutes later when Dominic Solanke's well-weighted pass teed up Johnson's sweeping left-footed strike. Spurs continued to dominate and found further reward when Maddison's tame attempt from Timo Werner's cutback somehow squirmed through Verbruggen's grasp. The hosts were back on level terms 10 minutes later when Mitoma’s delicate through-ball freed Rutter, who danced around two Tottenham defenders before firing a low left-footed finish past the helpless Guglielmo Vicario. And Rutter proved the difference for Brighton’s winner, battling to the byline past three Spurs defenders before lunging to lift a cross, which looped up off Rodrigo Bentancur, towards the six-yard box, where Welbeck was waiting to cap off a stunning comeback win. It was Mitoma again who smartly ghosted into an inside pocket of space before sliding through for Rutter, who made the most out of a half-chance to punish Spurs' fragile defence. Setback for Spurs
On the back of last week’s dominant win at Old Trafford, Postecoglou promised Spurs would not relent from their usual attacking principles on the south coast, and the away side delivered another exciting performance in the first half. Werner burst through Brighton's high line before his sliding across evaded the stretch of Johnson after less than a minute – and that was a sign of things to come. Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski were both denied by fine blocks in the early stages, too, before Solanke showed brilliant intelligence to drop deep and play through both Brighton's centre-backs to tee up Johnson's opener. Solanke's expert centre-forward play proved fruitful for Spurs' second as well, with the former Bournemouth striker dropping deep to free Werner, whose offload set up Maddison's fortuitous finish. Johnson blazed another presentable opening over after Kulusevski's fine pass, though defensive issues came back to haunt Postecoglou's men from then on. Udogie and Cristian Romero were left wanting for Minteh's strike, with Micky van de Ven also beaten too easily for Rutter's leveller before the Frenchman brushed off three of Postecoglou's defenders to create Welbeck's winner. For all of Spurs' attacking excitement, Postecoglou must find solutions at the back. West Ham are up next for Tottenham. Club reports

222,222,wolverhampton,2024-09-28,"Liverpool moved to the top of the Premier League table as Mohamed Salah's penalty handed them a 2-1 victory over Wolves at Molineux. Manchester City's 1-1 draw at Newcastle United earlier on Saturday handed Arne Slot's Reds the chance to go top, and Salah hit the winner from the spot after Nelson Semedo fouled former Wolves forward Diogo Jota. Ibrahima Konate had nodded Liverpool into the lead before his mistake at the other end allowed Rayan Ait-Nouri to briefly draw Wolves level early in the second half. Wolves never looked likely to equalise for a second time as their wait for a first win of the season continued, with Liverpool going close to a third goal on a couple of occasions. While the result took Liverpool one point clear of City and Arsenal at the summit, Wolves remain rooted to the bottom, with only one point from six matches. How the match unfolded
Despite injuries and illness leaving them short, Wolves kept Liverpool at bay for the majority of the first half, with Dominik Szoboszlai’s 40th-minute close-range shot straight at Sam Johnstone the best chance the visitors generated. Wolves' resolve was broken in first-half stoppage time, though – Johnstone failing to keep out Konate's header after Jota crossed from the left. Salah was gifted a chance for 2-0 after the restart, but he let Wolves off the hook by prodding wide after intercepting Mario Lemina's pass. A lapse at the other end got Wolves level as Konate went from Liverpool hero to villain. Curtis Jones tested Johnstone at his near post as Wolves wilted after the second Liverpool goal, the visitors cruising to back-to-back wins and top spot. Salah, Jota and Luis Diaz were kept quiet for much of the contest, with many of Liverpool's best opportunities the result of Wolves' insistence on playing out from the back in the face of a fierce press. Short-handed Wolves pay the price
It has been far from an ideal start to the season for Gary O'Neil's Wolves, who had already faced Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa in a daunting run of opening fixtures. Wolves had shown plenty of positive attacking signs in those games, but a failure to remain solid at the other end has repeatedly proven costly, with six points dropped from winning positions in back-to-back losses to Newcastle and Villa. Things got tougher for O'Neil this week, with Yerson Mosquera suffering a serious knee injury that will likely end his season, and fellow centre-back Craig Dawson sidelined by illness. There was plenty to like about Wolves' performance on Saturday, with the trio of Lemina, Joao Gomes and Andre particularly impressive as they disrupted Liverpool's midfield, but two defensive lapses made the difference. Johnstone should arguably have done better when attempting to keep out Konate's first-half header, then Semedo was caught on his heels just moments after Wolves' equaliser, recklessly dragging Jota to the ground at the back post. The fixture list has not been kind to Wolves to start the season, but they must cut out the errors after shipping 16 goals in six league games. They go to Brentford next, before Manchester City visit Molineux after the international break. Club reports

223,223,liverpool,2024-09-28,"Liverpool moved to the top of the Premier League table as Mohamed Salah's penalty handed them a 2-1 victory over Wolves at Molineux. Manchester City's 1-1 draw at Newcastle United earlier on Saturday handed Arne Slot's Reds the chance to go top, and Salah hit the winner from the spot after Nelson Semedo fouled former Wolves forward Diogo Jota. Ibrahima Konate had nodded Liverpool into the lead before his mistake at the other end allowed Rayan Ait-Nouri to briefly draw Wolves level early in the second half. Wolves never looked likely to equalise for a second time as their wait for a first win of the season continued, with Liverpool going close to a third goal on a couple of occasions. While the result took Liverpool one point clear of City and Arsenal at the summit, Wolves remain rooted to the bottom, with only one point from six matches. How the match unfolded
Despite injuries and illness leaving them short, Wolves kept Liverpool at bay for the majority of the first half, with Dominik Szoboszlai’s 40th-minute close-range shot straight at Sam Johnstone the best chance the visitors generated. Salah was gifted a chance for 2-0 after the restart, but he let Wolves off the hook by prodding wide after intercepting Mario Lemina's pass. A lapse at the other end got Wolves level as Konate went from Liverpool hero to villain. But within five minutes of the equaliser, Liverpool restored their advantage. Semedo pulled Jota back to concede a penalty, which Salah confidently dispatched. Curtis Jones tested Johnstone at his near post as Wolves wilted after the second Liverpool goal, the visitors cruising to back-to-back wins and top spot. Slot machine trundles on
Liverpool were far from their free-flowing best, but as was so often the case under Slot's predecessor Jurgen Klopp, they found a way to grind out the win. Salah, Jota and Luis Diaz were kept quiet for much of the contest, with many of Liverpool's best opportunities the result of Wolves' insistence on playing out from the back in the face of a fierce press. But when Jota got goal-side of Semedo to win a 61st-minute penalty, there was no doubt about the outcome, Salah crashing his spot-kick to Johnstone's left to re-establish Liverpool's lead. Salah now has eight goal involvements in six Premier League games this term, a tally only bettered by Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer, and if this is going to be his final season at Liverpool, he is doing all he can to ensure the Reds look well placed to challenge on multiple fronts. Slot's Liverpool machine continues to chug along nicely, with Crystal Palace up next before the Reds face huge back-to-back matches against Chelsea and Arsenal – a pair of fixtures that will put their title credentials to the test. There was plenty to like about Wolves' performance on Saturday, with the trio of Lemina, Joao Gomes and Andre particularly impressive as they disrupted Liverpool's midfield, but two defensive lapses made the difference.

224,224,chelsea,2024-10-06,"Noni Madueke’s equaliser earned Chelsea a point as they came from behind in a 1-1 draw with 10-man Nottingham Forest at Stamford Bridge. After a tepid first half, Chris Wood poked the visitors ahead in the 49th minute, but that lead did not last long as Madueke fired Chelsea level just eight minutes later. James Ward-Prowse was sent off for a second yellow card on 78 minutes, though neither side could find a winner in the fiery encounter despite a spate of late chances. Chelsea, on 14 points, hold onto fourth place going into the international break, while Forest are four points further back in ninth. How the match unfolded
The Blues dominated possession and chances in the opening stages, but struggled in front of goal, with Madueke going closest when he fired over from just outside the box 24 minutes in. Having been booked for bringing down Cole Palmer in the first half, Ward-Prowse saw red on 78 minutes for an intentional handball which prevented Nicolas Jackson from getting in behind. In a frantic 13 minutes of stoppage time, Neco Williams and Jota Silva forced Sanchez into strong saves, while Christopher Nkunku and Palmer also went close. Palmer remains central to the hosts’ attack
Last time out in the Premier League, Palmer made history, scoring all four goals in Chelsea’s 4-2 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion in a masterful individual display. And the Englishman went closest for Chelsea in the first half on Sunday. After Madueke had forced the turnover from Murillo he raced to the byline before cutting back for Palmer. It was then another contribution from Palmer which delivered Chelsea’s equaliser. He nearly provided the winner for Chelsea in the 87th minute, attempting to lob Sels from close range, before going close again in added time. It was a rare occasion that Palmer, who has contributed to 10 of Chelsea’s 16 Premier League goals this season, could not find the back of the net and Chelsea suffered for it. Despite Chelsea’s dominance, Forest took the lead against the run of play at Stamford Bridge, just as they had to secure the winner at Anfield. It was a set-piece delivered by Ward-Prowse from deep that Chelsea failed to deal with. While they could not maintain the lead on this occasion, it was another impressive defensive display that kept them in the game against a barrage of Chelsea attacks in the latter stages, even when reduced to 10 men.

Despite a late push by the dominant hosts, Forest held firm to continue their fine start in the Premier League against another top-four opponent. Chelsea, on 14 points, hold onto fourth place going into the international break, while Forest are four points further back in ninth. Murillo then unleashed a low, stinging shot straight at Sanchez before giving possession away at the other end moments later, but Madueke could not capitalise. After Madueke had forced the turnover from Murillo he raced to the byline before cutting back for Palmer. Forest continue to cause problems for top four
The visitors maintained their strong start to the season with another embattled display against a team at the top of the table. Despite Chelsea’s dominance, Forest took the lead against the run of play at Stamford Bridge, just as they had to secure the winner at Anfield. In fact, Forest could twice have regained the lead themselves as Silva’s header was millimetres from being out of reach of Sanchez’s outstretched hand. Club reports

226,226,nottingham-forest,2024-09-28,"Fulham brought Nottingham Forest's unbeaten start to the Premier League season to a halt with a hard-fought 1-0 victory at the City Ground. There was very little to choose between two sides separated by a mere point at kick-off, but Raul Jimenez’s second-half penalty, awarded for Murillo's foul on Andreas Pereira, proved decisive. Forest had started brightly as Taiwo Awoniyi missed an early chance, while Chris Wood saw a potential opener disallowed for offside in the 25th minute, with a VAR review confirming the on-field decision of referee Joshua Smith. However, Nuno Espirito Santo's team failed to find a spark without the suspended Morgan Gibbs-White as Fulham's own impressive start to 2024/25 continued. The result leaves Forest ninth in the table with nine points, with Fulham leapfrogging their hosts to move into sixth on 11 points. How the match unfolded
It was Forest who had the first chance after a quiet opening as Awoniyi – making his first start of the campaign – shot wide after a long throw caused chaos in the Fulham box. Almost immediately after the restart, another VAR check resulted in Murillo being penalised for stepping on Pereira's foot. With Forest chasing the match, Nuno brought on Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi and the latter went close to finding the top-right corner after a slaloming run into the box. Nuno's changes fall flat
With Gibbs-White suspended following his red card at Brighton last week, Forest boss Nuno was forced into attacking alterations. He decided to go with the added physical presence of Awoniyi, who partnered top scorer Wood in a two-pronged attack designed to unsettle the Fulham defence. Unfortunately for Forest, however, it seemed Awoniyi's inclusion prevented Wood from playing his natural game, reflected in the fact that he only touched the ball five times in the entirety of the first half. Awoniyi was replaced by Elanga immediately after the break as the hosts looked to inject more dynamism, but it was Fulham who made the breakthrough before producing a resolute defensive performance. Despite a positive start to the new campaign, Forest have now gone six matches without a victory on home soil, and things do not get much easier for them next time out, as they face in-form Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. But it was their defence that earned the plaudits against Forest, repelling everything thrown at them. Club reports

228,228,southampton,2025-04-02,"Matheus Franca’s injury-time header earned a point for Crystal Palace as they drew 1-1 at Southampton, whose relegation could be confirmed this weekend. That missed opportunity was emphasised when the Saints went in front midway through the first half, as Paul Onuachu planted a header into the net despite Dean Henderson’s best efforts at clawing the ball out. Southampton remain at the foot of the table but now move on to 10 points, while Crystal Palace stay in 12th place, as their five-match winning run in all competitions comes to an end. Southampton remained competitive in the contest and took the lead with their first chance of the match, as a fine cross from Mateus Fernandes was met by a powerful header from Onuachu. A mazy run by Ismaila Sarr caused problems for the Saints defence and he found Eze inside the area, but he could only curl his effort wide. Southampton show resilience despite setback
Southampton boss Juric said before this game that the goal for his side was to avoid being labelled as the worst team in the history of the Premier League. Saints needed to pick up three points from their remaining nine matches to better Derby County’s record total of 11 points in 2007/08. Saints remained compact and comfortable in their defensive shape for large parts of the second half but couldn’t hold on for a victory that their performance deserved. That encouraged Southampton to press higher up the pitch and force a number of mistakes in possession from Palace. Club reports

229,229,crystal-palace,2025-04-02,"Matheus Franca’s injury-time header earned a point for Crystal Palace as they drew 1-1 at Southampton, whose relegation could be confirmed this weekend. Jean-Philippe Mateta created the best opportunity for Palace barely a minute into the match but his brilliant strike on goal crashed against the crossbar. Southampton remain at the foot of the table but now move on to 10 points, while Crystal Palace stay in 12th place, as their five-match winning run in all competitions comes to an end. How the match unfolded
Palace nearly went in front inside two minutes, as Mateta picked up the ball from deep, ran with it unchallenged and struck an effort from outside the penalty area which cannoned off the underside of the crossbar. The visitors began to exert more control as the half drew to a close, with Aaron Ramsdale making a strong save to deny Mateta’s shot on the turn inside the area. A mazy run by Ismaila Sarr caused problems for the Saints defence and he found Eze inside the area, but he could only curl his effort wide. Palace looked like they were running out of ideas until Jefferson Lerma whipped in a cross in the 91st minute, with Franca stooping low at the front post to head home and hand the visitors a point. Below-par Palace suffer quarter-final hangover
Palace earned a place in the semi-final of the FA Cup for the first time in three years with an impressive 3-0 win over Fulham last time out. They were inches away from going ahead early on through Mateta’s wonderful strike but then allowed the game to drift in the first half. That encouraged Southampton to press higher up the pitch and force a number of mistakes in possession from Palace. Adam Wharton seemed hurried on the ball, especially in the first half, and that contributed to a performance that lacked creativity for large periods. This display was not up to Palace's recent standards that had earned them 11 wins from their last 14 matches, but a fine header from Franca continued Palace’s impressive unbeaten run in all competitions. Oliver Glasner’s side will hope to get back to winning ways when they host rivals Brighton and Hove Albion at the weekend. Club reports

230,230,liverpool,2025-04-02,"Diogo Jota was the hero as Liverpool edged out Everton 1-0 in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday. The forward scored the only goal at Anfield, where the Premier League leaders claimed local bragging rights and restored their 12-point lead at the top of the table. Jota delivered the decisive blow in the 57th minute, his neat finish securing the Reds’ 100th victory over the Toffees in all competitions. Arne Slot’s side are once again 12 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, who had reduced the deficit with their victory over Fulham on Tuesday. How the match unfolded
The competitive nature of the derby was evident in the 11th minute when James Tarkowski caught Alexis Mac Allister on the follow-through in a tackle but avoided a red card. At the other end, Beto thought he had put the visitors ahead when he got in behind Virgil van Dijk and neatly finished beyond Caoimhin Kelleher. Beto escaped Van Dijk again in the 33rd minute and raced through on goal but, with Kelleher beaten, saw his shot come back off the post. Liverpool bounce back
The international break came at a good time for Liverpool, with their hopes of completing a treble having evaporated in the space of a week. First, Paris Saint-Germain sent them out of the Champions League on penalties, and then Newcastle United beat the Reds in the EFL Cup final. This fixture against Everton provided an ideal opportunity for the Reds to get back on track, though their opponents generated the greater attacking threat during the first half, with the woodwork coming to their rescue and thwarting Beto. Nevertheless, Slot’s side appeared rejuvenated in the second half. It has been two years since Liverpool have lost a Premier League game when scoring first, and they never really looked like surrendering that advantage here. Next up for Liverpool is a trip to Fulham on Sunday before they host West Ham United the following weekend. That was the last time they had won at Anfield in front of a crowd, with their victory in the 2020/21 season coming behind closed doors. David Moyes was also out to end his own struggles at Anfield, where he had never overseen a Premier League victory in 19 previous attempts. Club reports

Jota delivered the decisive blow in the 57th minute, his neat finish securing the Reds’ 100th victory over the Toffees in all competitions. Everton stay 15th. How the match unfolded
The competitive nature of the derby was evident in the 11th minute when James Tarkowski caught Alexis Mac Allister on the follow-through in a tackle but avoided a red card. Jota made no mistake 12 minutes into the second half, taking Luis Diaz’s clever flick into his stride before sweeping the ball past Jordan Pickford. This fixture against Everton provided an ideal opportunity for the Reds to get back on track, though their opponents generated the greater attacking threat during the first half, with the woodwork coming to their rescue and thwarting Beto. Ryan Gravenberch tested Pickford with a rasping drive from distance, before Jota grabbed the breakthrough. No shots on target for Everton
Everton were hoping to party like it was 1999. Beto was unfortunate to strike the woodwork after beating Kelleher, but that was as close as the Toffees would come to scoring. Everton will be disappointed to see their unbeaten streak come to an end, but they cannot afford to let their heads drop, because things do not get any easier. After welcoming second-placed Arsenal to Goodison Park this weekend, trips to third-placed Nottingham Forest and sixth-placed Chelsea sandwich the visit of Manchester City. Club reports

232,232,arsenal,2025-04-01,"Bukayo Saka was the matchwinner on his return from injury as Arsenal beat Fulham 2-1 at Emirates Stadium. Saka had been sidelined since December but marked his comeback with a goal from the bench, and his close-range header ultimately proved decisive. Arsenal defender Gabriel was forced off through injury after only 16 minutes, but Mikel Merino put the Gunners ahead in the 37th minute, with substitute Saka doubling their advantage with a header shortly after coming on midway through the second half. Fulham's Rodrigo Muniz – who had earlier headed wide when presented with a glorious opportunity – struck in stoppage time to set up a nervy finish, but Mikel Arteta’s team held firm. Second-place Arsenal move nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday, while Fulham remain eighth, four points off the top four. How the match unfolded
The Gunners were dealt a blow when Gabriel went down and was substituted with what appeared to be a hamstring injury in the 16th minute, though that did not derail a strong start, and Ethan Nwaneri tested Bernd Leno with a powerful volley. And Arsenal’s dominance finally told when Nwaneri cut back for Merino, who managed to set himself and then prod a strike beyond Leno, courtesy of a deflection. Raul Jimenez forced David Raya into action and Jurrien Timber was denied by Leno at the other end before Saka made it 2-0 just seven minutes after coming on, nodding in after Gabriel Martinelli flicked on Merino’s cross. Muniz squandered a golden chance to get Fulham back in the game as he headed wide in the 81st minute, though a rather scuffed finish from the Brazilian deep in stoppage time meant Arsenal – who also saw a Martinelli goal disallowed for offside – were forced to hold on at the end. Injury concerns mount for Arteta despite Saka’s return
Arteta would have wanted his side to follow up their hard-fought 1-0 win over Chelsea last time out with a strong performance on Tuesday, and though Arsenal were not at their fluid best, they got the job done. Still, the biggest boost for Arteta came in the form of Saka. Making his long-awaited return after three months out, the England international eased some of Arsenal’s attacking concerns with that well-taken header – a case of right place, right time. Saka’s return is a markedly big relief for Arteta, who has had to do without key attackers following season-ending injuries for Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus. Merino has stepped up admirably as a makeshift striker in their absence, but Saka’s comeback adds much-needed firepower and more than a sprinkling of stardust. Gabriel’s early exit may leave Arsenal with just three fit centre-backs ahead of a looming UEFA Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid next week, with Everton next up before then. With Ben White not risked and Takehiro Tomiyasu and Riccardo Calafiori sidelined, Arteta will be hoping that his injury luck begins to change for the run-in. Fulham fall flat
Fulham would have been hoping to bounce back following Saturday’s FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace, and Marco Silva’s team went into this one having not lost in any of their last three league matches against Arsenal, picking up a win and two draws in that run. The Cottagers had only once had a better run avoiding defeat to the Gunners, going unbeaten in four games between May 2011 and November 2012, but they could not give the best account of themselves on this occasion. Muniz’s scampered shot made matters interesting late on, but before that he had wasted their best chance when he headed off-target following great work from former Arsenal playmaker Alex Iwobi. Fulham did improve in the second half, though lacked the necessary sharpness in front of goal, and they have now gone 32 games without a win at Arsenal in the league. Club reports

233,233,fulham,2025-04-01,"Bukayo Saka was the matchwinner on his return from injury as Arsenal beat Fulham 2-1 at Emirates Stadium. Fulham's Rodrigo Muniz – who had earlier headed wide when presented with a glorious opportunity – struck in stoppage time to set up a nervy finish, but Mikel Arteta’s team held firm. Second-place Arsenal move nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday, while Fulham remain eighth, four points off the top four. How the match unfolded
The Gunners were dealt a blow when Gabriel went down and was substituted with what appeared to be a hamstring injury in the 16th minute, though that did not derail a strong start, and Ethan Nwaneri tested Bernd Leno with a powerful volley. And Arsenal’s dominance finally told when Nwaneri cut back for Merino, who managed to set himself and then prod a strike beyond Leno, courtesy of a deflection. Raul Jimenez forced David Raya into action and Jurrien Timber was denied by Leno at the other end before Saka made it 2-0 just seven minutes after coming on, nodding in after Gabriel Martinelli flicked on Merino’s cross. Muniz squandered a golden chance to get Fulham back in the game as he headed wide in the 81st minute, though a rather scuffed finish from the Brazilian deep in stoppage time meant Arsenal – who also saw a Martinelli goal disallowed for offside – were forced to hold on at the end. Fulham fall flat
Fulham would have been hoping to bounce back following Saturday’s FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace, and Marco Silva’s team went into this one having not lost in any of their last three league matches against Arsenal, picking up a win and two draws in that run. The Cottagers had only once had a better run avoiding defeat to the Gunners, going unbeaten in four games between May 2011 and November 2012, but they could not give the best account of themselves on this occasion. Muniz’s scampered shot made matters interesting late on, but before that he had wasted their best chance when he headed off-target following great work from former Arsenal playmaker Alex Iwobi. Fulham did improve in the second half, though lacked the necessary sharpness in front of goal, and they have now gone 32 games without a win at Arsenal in the league. Up next is an even tougher challenge, as Fulham host league leaders Liverpool. However, with European qualification still well within reach, Silva’s side have plenty left to fight for. Club reports

234,234,everton,2024-09-28,"Dwight McNeil’s double secured Everton’s first three points of the Premier League season, coming from behind to beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Goodison Park. Marc Guehi gave the visitors an early lead, poking home at the near post, seeming to signal the continuation of Everton’s woes. But Sean Dyche’s side rallied after the break, with McNeil hitting the back of the net with a delightful long-range strike in the 47th minute before adding a second at the far post just seven minutes later as they continued their fine form against Palace at Goodison Park. The win lifts Everton out of the relegation zone and up to 15th, leapfrogging Palace, who drop to 17th. How the match unfolded
Guehi was alert to give the visitors the lead after 10 minutes from a short-corner routine – Maxence Lacroix nodded down Adam Wharton’s cross at the back post for the captain to poke past Jordan Pickford. Two minutes after the restart, McNeil found space outside the box, unleashing a curling effort that nestled spectacularly in the far-left top corner. A floated cross from Jack Harrison on the right found the midfielder at the far post, and he took a touch before volleying home from a tight angle. McNeil gifts Everton a comeback of their own
Everton’s last three Premier League matches have seen them drop points from leading positions. Yet individual brilliance from McNeil gave the Toffees a taste of that comeback delight in an impressive second-half display from the hosts. Their first half was lacklustre, as Everton only created limited chances – Calvert-Lewin squandered their best opportunity, failing to make contact with McNeil’s cross in front of goal. After the restart, McNeil took matters into his own hands and dazzled with his stunning long-range effort off the right which Dean Henderson had no chance of getting to. Harrison’s ball from the right was perfectly weighted, and McNeil showed impressive control to set the ball up with his first touch before firing home with his second. It was a much-needed three points for a struggling Everton side who showed good resilience to hold onto a lead for the first time this season, and Dyche will be hoping they can truly kickstart their season from here. A tale of two halves for the Palace defence
The focal point in defence was meant to be the return of Jarrad Branthwaite for the hosts, but it was Palace’s back three who delivered the goods at both ends in the first half. They dominated the air to clear on numerous occasions, neutralising the aerial threat of Calvert-Lewin. So it was unsurprising that Everton’s breakthrough came from range as McNeil was left with too much space in the midfield after a sloppy giveaway, and they continued to struggle with McNeil’s clinical edge. Following the Everton midfielder’s two-goal salvo, the aerial assurance was restored as Lacroix silenced Calvert-Lewin for the duration. Club reports

Guehi was alert to give the visitors the lead after 10 minutes from a short-corner routine – Maxence Lacroix nodded down Adam Wharton’s cross at the back post for the captain to poke past Jordan Pickford. Palace found more success from their corners as the half went on and nearly scored a goal identical to their first, only for Iliman Ndiaye to block Daniel Munoz’s shot. Abdoulaye Doucoure had the opportunity to put the game to bed with 10 minutes left, but a last-ditch challenge from Lacroix spared Palace’s blushes. A tale of two halves for the Palace defence
The focal point in defence was meant to be the return of Jarrad Branthwaite for the hosts, but it was Palace’s back three who delivered the goods at both ends in the first half. The combination of Guehi and Lacroix gave the visitors an early lead as the latter leapt highest by some distance to meet Wharton’s cross. It was an equally astute performance from the pair in defence to keep Palace’s clean sheet intact until half-time on Merseyside. Even with goalkeeper Henderson’s last-minute header from a corner, the defence could not save Palace from defeat. Club reports

236,236,chelsea,2024-09-28,"Cole Palmer made Premier League history as Chelsea beat Brighton 4-2 in a six-goal thriller at Stamford Bridge. Palmer became the first player to score four goals before half-time in a single Premier League match, leading Enzo Maresca’s side to a fourth straight victory in all competitions. Brighton took an early lead through Georginio Rutter’s header, but were powerless as Palmer took command of the contest with a rapid hat-trick. His quadruple came in the space of 20 minutes, with Carlos Baleba’s strike to make it 3-2 swiftly cancelled out by the Chelsea talisman’s fourth goal of an extraordinary performance. The Blues climb to fourth place, a point behind Manchester City and Arsenal, while Brighton drop to eighth after suffering their first defeat of the season. Chelsea fell behind in the seventh minute when Levi Colwill’s attempted clearance deflected high into the air, and Rutter bravely outjumped Robert Sanchez to nod home. However, Palmer then took centre stage. The Blues forward had already been denied by a post and offside flag when he slotted into an empty net in the 21st minute after Nicolas Jackson pounced on Adam Webster’s loose back pass. Palmer put Chelsea ahead from the penalty spot seven minutes later after Baleba bundled over Jadon Sancho, before completing his hat-trick just after the half-hour mark with a magnificent 25-yard free-kick. Baleba halved the deficit when he punished Sanchez’s loose pass, but Palmer grabbed his and Chelsea’s fourth in the 41st minute, latching onto Sancho’s through-ball and firing past Bart Verbruggen at his near post. Palmer almost turned provider four minutes after the restart with a sublime first-time pass finding Jackson, who was brilliantly denied on the line by Webster. History-making Palmer pulls the strings once more
There is no doubting who is Chelsea’s main man. Palmer completed his hat-trick in the space of only nine minutes and 46 seconds, though – but for the woodwork and offside flag – he could have done so in just two minutes. Cucurella also had an effort ruled out for offside, as did Sancho who, along with Palmer, Noni Madueke and Jackson in an unchanged and settled front four, looked dangerous every time they attacked Brighton’s high defensive line. Now with four straight wins under their belt – and a league-high 15 goals from their first six encounters – Chelsea will be eager to keep that momentum going at home to Nottingham Forest next weekend. It has certainly been an excellent start for Maresca, and with Palmer in this kind of form, the Blues look well set to challenge at the top. However, that seemed to spark Chelsea into life and Brighton always looked vulnerable to their opponents’ pace and power in attack. All four goals they conceded saw slight defensive lapses ruthlessly punished by the Blues, and in particular Palmer. First, Webster’s loose back pass led to the equaliser opener, then Baleba and Pervis Estupinan’s fouls were converted from the respective dead-ball situations by Palmer, whose fourth came after Verbruggen’s sloppy pass out from the back.

238,238,aston-villa,2024-10-06,"Aston Villa and Manchester United shared the spoils in an underwhelming 0-0 draw at Villa Park. Marcus Rashford, who was perhaps fortunate not to be sent off, and Youri Tielemans also went close, but neither team were able to find the breakthrough. Unai Emery's side sit fifth on 14 points, while United are 14th on eight points, which is their lowest-ever tally after seven matches of a Premier League campaign. The hosts were forced into an early defensive change when Ezri Konsa limped off, while United followed suit at half-time as Harry Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui made way. Tielemans brought a fine save out of Andre Onana after Emiliano Martinez had thwarted Rashford at the other end – with the Villa fans subsequently left incensed when the United forward escaped a second booking after a rash foul on Leon Bailey. The woodwork came to Villa's rescue in the 68th minute when Fernandes struck the crossbar with his dipping free-kick, though Philogene may have won it in stoppage time had Diogo Dalot not got in the way of his goalbound strike, and that lack of cutting edge when it mattered most was ultimately the tale of the game for both sides, though. Villa unable to build on Bayern momentum
Villa had plenty of reasons to be optimistic ahead of welcoming a struggling United to the west midlands. Emery’s side were fresh from their best start to a Premier League season in 16 years, as well as a famous UEFA Champions League victory over Bayern Munich on Wednesday. It looked like they would after Rogers’ early chance, but the injury to Konsa seemed to stop them in their tracks and allow United to gain a foothold in the match. Nevertheless, Villa extended their unbeaten run to eight matches in all competitions, while keeping them firmly in touch of the top four heading into the international break. At the back, United generally limited Villa to hold out for their third successive clean sheet away from home, with veteran Jonny Evans excellent. Club reports

Villa had plenty of reasons to be optimistic ahead of welcoming a struggling United to the west midlands. It looked like they would after Rogers’ early chance, but the injury to Konsa seemed to stop them in their tracks and allow United to gain a foothold in the match. Will Ten Hag get more time?
This is United’s worst points tally after seven matches of a league season since the 1989/90 campaign, and it is safe to say it has not been a good week for Erik ten Hag. United have generally been slow out of the blocks under Ten Hag in the Premier League, with nine points from the opening seven matches of his two previous seasons in charge, but will the club’s leadership give him the time to put it right this season?
After Thursday’s draw with FC Porto, Ten Hag made changes in the heart of defence, but one of them – Maguire – was forced off at half-time through injury, with Mazraoui also making way, before Victor Lindelof and Matthijs de Ligt came on. At the back, United generally limited Villa to hold out for their third successive clean sheet away from home, with veteran Jonny Evans excellent. However, aside from Rashford and Fernandes’ attempts, they struggled to generate a decent attacking threat, particularly from open play, and have now failed to score in three consecutive league fixtures. While it was definitely an improvement on what United turned in against Tottenham Hotspur last week, the question now is whether Ten Hag will still have the club’s backing. Club reports

240,240,brentford,2024-09-28,"Brentford and West Ham United shared the points in a keenly-contested London derby as Bryan Mbeumo’s goal was cancelled out by Tomas Soucek in a 1-1 draw at the Gtech Community Stadium. Mbeumo volleyed home from close range after 38 seconds to give Brentford the perfect start, but the hosts could not build on their advantage and West Ham equalised early in the second half. The point leaves Brentford 12th in the Premier League table, while West Ham are two places below them in 14th. How the match unfolded
For the third Premier League match in a row, Brentford opened the scoring inside the first minute and became the first team to ever achieve that feat. The Bees kept the ball alive inside the penalty area and Fabio Carvalho headed the ball across to Mbeumo to produce a volleyed finish into the roof of the net inside 38 seconds. That was the only shot on target in the first half in a competitive and tight affair at the Gtech Community Stadium. Bees quick off the mark again
It took Brentford just 38 seconds to strike and, after goals in the opening minute against Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City in their recent Premier League fixtures, they are gaining a reputation as fast starters. Mbeumo is becoming the main man at Brentford with a fifth goal in six matches and a 14th goal involvement in 15 London derby appearances in the Premier League. Mbeumo did head over Mikkel Damsgaard’s inviting delivery, but the hosts never looked like adding to their early goal. Thomas Frank’s side also never looked in danger of conceding an equalising goal, but a slice of luck for the visitors drew the contest level. Brentford’s propensity to drop points from losing positions will be a cause of concern for Frank, but they look strong at home and a tricky test for any team. After conceding early, the visitors did gain more composure within the match but found it difficult to break down a stubborn Brentford defence. Club reports

After a week in which West Ham lost at home to Chelsea and were knocked out of the EFL Cup by Liverpool, they got off to the worst possible start in west London. Mohammed Kudus’ close-range volley was blocked and Antonio dragged an effort wide, but the Hammers' pressure for an equaliser lacked cutting edge.

242,242,wolverhampton,2025-04-01,"Jorgen Strand Larsen was the hero as Wolverhampton Wanderers moved 12 points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with a 1-0 win over West Ham United. Strand Larsen’s 10th league goal of the season was enough for Wolves to seal back-to-back wins, having beaten Southampton before the international break. Vitor Pereira’s Wolves side remain 17th but pulled further clear of the bottom three and five points behind the Hammers, who are a place above them. However, Wolves went ahead in the 21st minute when the ball broke kindly on the edge of the area for Strand Larsen, whose shot took a slight deflection off former Wolves defender Maximilian Kilman before beating Areola. The Norwegian was slipped in by Joao Gomes, but Marshall Munetsi could only rattle the crossbar after running onto the loose ball. Although Munetsi missed another chance to put the game to bed in stoppage time, Wolves held out to move a step closer to securing their Premier League place. Strand Larsen doubles up in Cunha absence
Wolves had pulled away from immediate danger after collecting 10 points from their last six Premier League matches. Nevertheless, they would have been wary, having lost on three of their five most recent outings at Molineux. Matheus Cunha watched on from the stands as he continued to serve his four-match suspension, but Strand Larsen stepped up in his absence with a fine strike taking his league tally for the season into double figures. Wolves are strong when they take the lead, avoiding defeat in each of their last seven matches when scoring first prior to this game, and they never looked in danger of seeing that streak end, with West Ham struggling to create many opportunities. Yet a meeting with Wolves, who they have enjoyed success against in recent times, should have buoyed them, and they had a great opening early on. Club reports

243,243,west-ham-united,2025-04-01,"Jorgen Strand Larsen was the hero as Wolverhampton Wanderers moved 12 points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with a 1-0 win over West Ham United. West Ham's Niclas Fullkrug hit the bar, while Tomas Soucek fired wide from close range late on, but the Hammers generally struggled to mount a sustained attacking threat, as they suffered their fourth defeat in seven away matches in all competitions. Vitor Pereira’s Wolves side remain 17th but pulled further clear of the bottom three and five points behind the Hammers, who are a place above them. Matt Doherty denied Evan Ferguson an almost certain tap-in from inside the six-yard box, while Alphonse Areola pushed away Toti’s header at the other end. However, Wolves went ahead in the 21st minute when the ball broke kindly on the edge of the area for Strand Larsen, whose shot took a slight deflection off former Wolves defender Maximilian Kilman before beating Areola. It was not until the 78th minute that West Ham went close to an equaliser. Wolves are strong when they take the lead, avoiding defeat in each of their last seven matches when scoring first prior to this game, and they never looked in danger of seeing that streak end, with West Ham struggling to create many opportunities. Toothless Hammers’ struggles on travels continue
West Ham’s previous six away Premier League matches had yielded just one victory and three defeats. Ferguson arguably should have put them ahead when he was found by Jarrod Bowen in the six-yard box, but he could not make clean contact. The Hammers were always going to face an uphill battle from that point, having failed to win this season when conceding first. In an attempt to buck that trend, the West Ham head coach shuffled his pack by making three changes at the break – among them, the return of Fullkrug after three months out. However, it took over half an hour for the Hammers to threaten. West Ham are unlikely to be dragged back into the relegation battle with a 17-point cushion between them and Ipswich, but Potter will want his side to bounce back and finish the season as strongly as possible.

William Saliba received a red card on the half-hour mark, giving the hosts a glorious opportunity for an upset at the Vitality Stadium. And midway through the second half, Bournemouth took that chance, with Christie breaking the deadlock in the 70th minute before Kluivert doubled their advantage from the penalty spot. Arsenal stay third, missing the chance to go top with Liverpool and Manchester City not playing until Sunday, while Bournemouth move up to 10th after collecting their third win of the season. Gabriel Martinelli almost made Bournemouth pay against the run of play, but Kepa Arrizabalaga made a sharp, low stop to keep the scoreline level. Just 95 seconds later, the Cherries’ pressure paid off as Christie rifled a first-time shot into the top corner after he was left unmarked at a corner. Raya tripped Evanilson in his haste to close the angle in a one-on-one soon after, giving away a spot-kick that Kluivert emphatically fired in to seal what is only Bournemouth’s second Premier League win over Arsenal. Bournemouth find their clinical edge
Despite a bright start to the season, especially compared to where they were this time last year, Andoni Iraola has expressed some frustration with Bournemouth’s recent results. The Cherries carry a great attacking threat under the Spaniard, with late comebacks earlier in the season highlighting their prowess, but they have also been guilty of squandering golden chances. Semenyo was their main outlet from the start and had a hat-trick of opportunities, the best of which saw him volley over unchallenged just after the restart, as Bournemouth struggled to capitalise on their numerical advantage. Marcus Tavernier also nodded an effort wide as Bournemouth peppered crosses into the box, and it looked like it might not be their day until the substitutes entered the fray. And Iraola will see that as a step in the right direction, especially with more tough matches in Aston Villa and Man City next up. Arsenal struggle without Saka’s spark
Despite being dealt injury blows over the international break, Arteta would still have been confident of extending their unbeaten run against Bournemouth, but ultimately Bukayo Saka’s absence was harshly felt. Club reports

William Saliba received a red card on the half-hour mark, giving the hosts a glorious opportunity for an upset at the Vitality Stadium. That spot-kick ensured Arsenal could not salvage a result to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign as the Gunners came up short on a frustrating day for Mikel Arteta and suffered their first away defeat in the league in 2024. Arsenal stay third, missing the chance to go top with Liverpool and Manchester City not playing until Sunday, while Bournemouth move up to 10th after collecting their third win of the season. That changed when Saliba pulled down Evanilson just inside Arsenal’s half as the forward threatened to run in behind, and saw his yellow card upgraded to a straight red for denying a goalscoring opportunity after a VAR review. Gabriel Martinelli almost made Bournemouth pay against the run of play, but Kepa Arrizabalaga made a sharp, low stop to keep the scoreline level.

Arsenal struggle without Saka’s spark
Despite being dealt injury blows over the international break, Arteta would still have been confident of extending their unbeaten run against Bournemouth, but ultimately Bukayo Saka’s absence was harshly felt. But even with 11 men, the Gunners were missing Saka’s influence, especially after he orchestrated their comeback against Southampton last time out. Raheem Sterling was switched out to the right in Saka’s place but struggled to impose himself, and was the unlucky player sacrificed so Arteta could add an extra defender in Jakub Kiwior following Saliba’s red card. Arsenal did not sit behind the ball like they did when going down to 10 men against Man City earlier in the season but still seemed hesitant to commit bodies forward, hindering their progress when they did push through midfield. Martinelli, who almost missed out himself with a calf problem, came on to give them a more direct influence down the left, while Gabriel Jesus was added to the fray too, but Arsenal looked toothless, which will be a big worry for Arteta with Liverpool their next Premier League opponent. The Spaniard will be holding out hope Saka is back for that encounter. Club reports

246,246,nottingham-forest,2025-04-01,"Anthony Elanga struck the winning goal against his former club as Nottingham Forest beat Manchester United 1-0 at the City Ground. Fresh from booking their place in the FA Cup semi-finals with a penalty shoot-out victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday, Nuno Espirito Santo's men took another big step towards qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. It was a trademark counter-attacking goal that decided the contest, with Elanga running from deep inside his own half before tucking home after only five minutes. Man Utd remain in 13th spot, while the victory takes third-placed Forest eight points clear of Chelsea and nine above Manchester City ahead of their matches later this week. How the match unfolded
Matz Sels pushed a long-range effort from Bruno Fernandes wide early on, and Forest then hit the front with a devastating counter-attack from the resulting corner. After Fernandes's cross was cleared, Elanga carried the ball from deep inside his own half before stroking into the bottom-right corner from the edge of United's area. Two huge opportunities fell the way of the defender, who was unable to divert Patrick Dorgu's cross on target before forcing a heroic goal-line clearance from Murillo deep into stoppage time. No Wood, no problem
Forest have repeatedly made a mockery of suggestions their form will dip, but there must have been concern when talisman Chris Wood suffered a hip injury on international duty with New Zealand. Although Taiwo Awoniyi came in to replace Forest's 18-goal marksman on Tuesday, it was those flanking the Nigerian – Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – that carried the greatest threat. Rapid counters have embodied Forest's identity this season, and Elanga carried the ball an astonishing 85 metres for his opener, travelling from midway inside his own half to the United box. This was not a vintage performance – after edging ahead, Forest did not attempt another shot until first-half stoppage time. But even the loss of Ola Aina to injury did not shake their defensive resolve, with Nuno Espirito Santo seamlessly switching from a 4-2-3-1 to a 3-4-3 formation. Forest got a slice of fortune when the woodwork thwarted Dalot, and they were indebted to Murillo for denying Maguire in the dying seconds, but for long periods, Man Utd were limited to hopeful long-range efforts. Only five points separate fourth-place Chelsea from AFC Bournemouth in 10th, but Forest have every chance of pulling away from that pack, with or without Wood. That change led to Fernandes adopting a deeper role, and his influence was reduced after the break even as Forest further conceded possession. His physicality caused some problems for Forest, but he was lacking the necessary composure when two big chances fell his way. Club reports

248,248,arsenal,2025-03-16,"Mikel Merino's first-half header proved the difference as Arsenal strengthened their grip on second place in the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over rivals Chelsea. Mikel Arteta's side headed into Sunday's derby winless in their last three league matches, but they produced a much-needed response to restore their four-point cushion over third-placed Nottingham Forest. Enzo Maresca's side did not improve much after the break as Merino almost doubled his tally, and Arsenal's lead, with a second-half volley that forced Robert Sanchez into a fine stop as the hosts ran out comfortable winners. Arsenal's win leaves them 12 points adrift of runaway leaders Liverpool, while Chelsea remain fourth – just one point clear of fifth-placed Manchester City and two ahead of Newcastle United, who have a game hand. How the match unfolded
An unconvincing Chelsea defence was repeatedly exposed in the opening stages, with Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli going close before Declan Rice blazed over after Sanchez scrambled to parry Wesley Fofana's deflected clearance. Arsenal soon made their dominance pay when Odegaard's right-sided corner found the stooping Merino, whose near-post flick-on looped over Sanchez to open the scoring. An uneventful second half was brought to life on the hour when Sanchez expertly repelled Merino's left-footed volley on the line after a delightful right-wing delivery by Martinelli. Cucurella remained Chelsea's unlikely attacking threat, though his weak header from substitute Tyrique George's late cross proved little trouble for Raya as Arsenal held on for the win. Arteta finds much-needed response
Arteta needed a response on Sunday, having seen his side held to draws at high-flying Forest and struggling Manchester United after their disappointing 1-0 home defeat to West Ham United. Arsenal duly obliged, racing out the blocks as Trossard steered wide, Martinelli curled at Sanchez and Rice skewed over after Jurrien Timber's cross had caused chaos inside the Chelsea box. Cucurella also survived handball appeals in the build-up to Rice's chance, with the VAR confirming referee Chris Kavanagh's decision that the full-back's arm was in an expected position without any clear or deliberate action towards the ball. The hosts' set-piece proficiency then proved decisive for Merino's neat opener before Martinelli – this time from the right of the area – fired over when unleashed by chief creator Odegaard. Arteta's only criticism may have been that Arsenal's margin of victory was not more handsome, with Merino's volley and Odegaard's tame effort from Rice's cutback the closest Arsenal went to a second after the break. Arsenal will look to pick up where they left off after the international break when they host top-six challengers Fulham – who were 2-0 winners over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday – on 1 April. Palmer-less blues for Chelsea 
Maresca had already conceded before Sunday's encounter that there was a ""quite big"" gap between Arsenal and Chelsea, and Palmer's injury-enforced absence only made that difference in quality greater at Emirates Stadium. Although Palmer has struggled for form in recent weeks, this was the first time since April 2024 that Chelsea started a Premier League match without him – on that occasion, they lost 5-0 at Arsenal. Chelsea may have been fearing a repeat as Sanchez twice nearly afforded Arsenal an opener; first teeing up Martinelli with a poor pass before dropping Timber's cross to almost set up Trossard.

Arsenal had been in complete control after Gabriel Martinelli opened his account for the season with an instinctive finish inside the box, with Leandro Trossard doubling the hosts’ advantage. Yet Justin – whose second was an eye-catching volley – turned the match on its head until Mikel Arteta’s side came good again in the closing stages, with Trossard’s effort deflected in by the unfortunate Wilfred Ndidi before Kai Havertz sealed the win. Arsenal move level with Manchester City on 14 points, but are one point behind leaders Liverpool, after they won 2-1 at Wolves. How the match unfolded
The hosts started strongly and eventually found the breakthrough in the 20th minute, with Martinelli sweeping home Jurrien Timber’s cross after the Brazilian had flashed an effort over the crossbar moments earlier. Martinelli then turned provider for Arsenal’s second in first-half injury time, pulling the ball back for Trossard who marked his return from suspension with his second Premier League goal of the season. Arsenal’s attempts to get back ahead were thwarted by the imposing Mads Hermansen, with the visiting goalkeeper making a string of saves to deny Gabriel Magalhaes and Trossard, and it looked as though Leicester had done enough. But in the fourth minute of stoppage time, their resolve was punctured when Ndidi bundled in Trossard’s back-post shot, with Justin subsequently capping his eventful encounter when his clearance cannoned in off Havertz, with the goal disallowed for offside but then awarded after the decision was overturned following a VAR review. Gunners on the right end of late drama
Having dropped points in the dying stages of their enthralling clash with Man City last week, Arsenal showcased their willingness to carry on going until the end, with their persistence eventually paying off. Arteta’s side dominated the opening period and were rewarded with two goals, though how easy the Gunners found their way into Leicester’s box seemingly saw them take their foot off the pedal, and that slackness was punished emphatically by Justin. Having seen their two-goal advantage evaporate, and having been on the wrong end of a moment of individual brilliance from Justin, Arsenal burst back into life, only to see several efforts met with a string of impressive saves by Hermansen. Ethan Nwaneri and Riccardo Calafiori saw efforts saved, with Leicester, in their attempts to salvage a point, resulting in the dark arts that Arsenal had shown in their draw with City. But that ultimately came back to bite the Foxes, with Arsenal channelling their frustrations into a goalscoring reaction during a long period of added time, albeit helped by the misfortune of Ndidi and Justin. Foxes fall just short
Ahead of kick-off, Steve Cooper said that Arsenal’s showing against Manchester City was the level he aspired to reach with his Leicester side, and the Foxes’ display at the Emirates proved they can be match for most teams. Martinelli’s opener came at the end of an endless wave of Arsenal pressure, though Cooper felt his side should have been awarded a free-kick prior to the goal, with Jamie Vardy having been in a tussle with William Saliba.

For all of Leicester’s perseverance, they came undone at the final moment. Arsenal’s never-ending pressure finally told, but the Foxes’ second-half performance showed promising signs for the future.

Ndiaye provided the spark on the road once again for Everton, as he netted in successive away games and, after Ipswich had a penalty awarded but then overturned following a VAR review, Keane produced a clever close-range finish to put the Toffees in control. Ipswich showed signs of life after the restart, yet Conor Chaplin’s scuffed effort late on was the best they could muster, with Jordan Pickford largely untroubled and Everton spurning some decent chances to put the contest to bed at the other end. Everton stay 16th but are now four points above Kieran McKenna’s side, who are struggling with the Premier League pace as one of four teams yet to win in 2024/25. How the match unfolded
An IT issue at Portman Road forced a 15-minute delay to kick-off and there were early connection issues for the attackers when the game got going – Jack Clarke slicing over and Dominic Calvert-Lewin fluffing his lines against Arijanet Muric. Wes Burns failed to deal with Jack Harrison's cross and Everton’s No 10 ruthlessly fired in his second Premier League goal. There was more frustration for Ipswich when Clarke tumbled under pressure from Dwight McNeil, but referee Michael Oliver overturned his penalty decision following a VAR review. Defensive issues were again Ipswich's downfall five minutes before the break, as McNeil teed up Keane, who lashed home from a tight angle. Everton’s failure to add a third opened the door for a late Ipswich flurry, though Chaplin and Jack Taylor saw attempts routinely kept out by Pickford before Calvert-Lewin failed to beat Muric again right at the end. As Ipswich carried an improved attacking threat in the second period, Ndiaye readily dropped back to shield left-back Vitalii Mykolenko. Portman pressure weighs heavy on Delap
Liam Delap fed off scraps as the focal point of Ipswich’s attack, against a resolute Everton backline, with the hosts failing to register a shot on target before he was replaced in the 79th minute. The former Manchester City forward has scored four of Ipswich’s six Premier League goals this season. However, he was kept under lock and key by Keane and James Tarkowski this time around and Ipswich just could not find a way to get their talisman involved. Confidence is low at Portman Road, as the excitement of a top-flight comeback makes way for the reality of Premier League demands, and Delap, for all his bustle and undoubted quality, needs help from elsewhere.

253,253,everton,2024-10-19,"Everton stretched their Premier League unbeaten run to four matches as Sean Dyche’s side saw off Ipswich Town 2-0 at Portman Road. The Toffees showed little sign of rustiness after the international break, as first-half goals from Iliman Ndiaye and Michael Keane set them on course for their second league victory of the season. Ndiaye provided the spark on the road once again for Everton, as he netted in successive away games and, after Ipswich had a penalty awarded but then overturned following a VAR review, Keane produced a clever close-range finish to put the Toffees in control.

An IT issue at Portman Road forced a 15-minute delay to kick-off and there were early connection issues for the attackers when the game got going – Jack Clarke slicing over and Dominic Calvert-Lewin fluffing his lines against Arijanet Muric. A defensive error gifted Calvert-Lewin that chance and another mistake handed Ndiaye his 17th-minute breakthrough. Wes Burns failed to deal with Jack Harrison's cross and Everton’s No 10 ruthlessly fired in his second Premier League goal. There was more frustration for Ipswich when Clarke tumbled under pressure from Dwight McNeil, but referee Michael Oliver overturned his penalty decision following a VAR review. Defensive issues were again Ipswich's downfall five minutes before the break, as McNeil teed up Keane, who lashed home from a tight angle. Everton’s failure to add a third opened the door for a late Ipswich flurry, though Chaplin and Jack Taylor saw attempts routinely kept out by Pickford before Calvert-Lewin failed to beat Muric again right at the end. Ndiaye has the grit and guile for Dyche’s Everton blueprint
Dyche’s reputation for setting up disciplined teams ensures a need for creativity to emerge and Ndiaye provides exactly that for Everton. He is already a firm fan favourite and goals in back-to-back away matches will only help ender him to the travelling Toffees, alongside his swaggering style and mazy dribbles on the left side of Everton’s attack. Crucially for a player working under Dyche, the Senegal international is showing both an ability to make an impact in attack and help out in defence. Dyche demands a rounded performance from his attackers and Ndiaye’s opening goal was balanced against his willingness to dig in as needed, and he was well worth the adulation from the away supporters when he was taken off in the 82nd minute. Portman pressure weighs heavy on Delap
Liam Delap fed off scraps as the focal point of Ipswich’s attack, against a resolute Everton backline, with the hosts failing to register a shot on target before he was replaced in the 79th minute. However, he was kept under lock and key by Keane and James Tarkowski this time around and Ipswich just could not find a way to get their talisman involved. Second-half run-ins with Pickford and Abdoulaye Doucoure, with Delap barging into both of them when challenging for loose balls were the hallmarks of an emerging player short on in-game options.

254,254,newcastle-united,2024-09-28,"Anthony Gordon’s second-half penalty saw Newcastle United come from behind to frustrate Premier League leaders Manchester City in a 1-1 draw at St James’ Park. Gordon, who has been at the centre of media speculation over his future this week, levelled the score from the penalty spot in the 58th minute, converting a spot-kick that he won after being tripped by Ederson. Newcastle drop to seventh following a win for Fulham at Nottingham Forest. Joelinton almost clawed Newcastle level on the stroke of half-time, bringing down a corner on the stretch, only to see his rifled effort pushed away by Ederson, though the City goalkeeper played his part in the hosts’ equaliser. Gordon took a tumble as Ederson rushed out in a one-v-one, with the penalty awarded on field and confirmed by the VAR – Newcastle’s number 10 holding his nerve to slam home. While Sean Longstaff dragged Newcastle’s best chance wide, Eddie Howe’s side were indebted to Pope at the other end as he punched the ball clear of Haaland before denying Silva and then collecting a header from City’s striker in the closing stages. Gordon steals the spotlight
After what Howe described as their worst performance of the season against Fulham, Newcastle put up a great fight as they went toe-to-toe with the champions. Joelinton was their driving force in the first half, causing real problems when the Magpies got the ball into the box, and he was unlucky not to get on the scoresheet. And while the Brazilian continued to be a thorn in City’s side after the break, it was Gordon who proved the difference maker. Gordon, who is reportedly close to signing a new contract at Newcastle, showed why he is so crucial to Howe’s plans. Newcastle’s equaliser lit a fire in the hosts, and as they pushed for a winner, Guardiola was forced to change things again, with Phil Foden’s introduction giving City the control they had lacked at the start of the second half.

255,255,manchester-city,2024-09-28,"Anthony Gordon’s second-half penalty saw Newcastle United come from behind to frustrate Premier League leaders Manchester City in a 1-1 draw at St James’ Park. Josko Gvardiol had put City ahead with a neat close-range finish in the 35th minute of Saturday’s contest. Both sides saw chances go begging as they pushed for a winner, with Erling Haaland heading at Nick Pope late on as the Norwegian failed to score for the first time in the league this season. Pep Guardiola’s side drop to second in the table on 14 points after they were overtaken by Liverpool, who won 2-1 at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Aston Villa could also go above the champions with a win at Ipswich Town while Arsenal are level on points with City. How the match unfolded
After a scrappy start, Gvardiol put City ahead when he skilfully dragged the ball away from Dan Burn before slotting a low strike into the bottom-right corner, with every City player other than Bernardo Silva playing a part in the build-up to the goal. Joelinton almost clawed Newcastle level on the stroke of half-time, bringing down a corner on the stretch, only to see his rifled effort pushed away by Ederson, though the City goalkeeper played his part in the hosts’ equaliser. While Sean Longstaff dragged Newcastle’s best chance wide, Eddie Howe’s side were indebted to Pope at the other end as he punched the ball clear of Haaland before denying Silva and then collecting a header from City’s striker in the closing stages. And while the Brazilian continued to be a thorn in City’s side after the break, it was Gordon who proved the difference maker. Guardiola’s midfield headache
All eyes were on City’s midfield after the news that Rodri would be missing the rest of the season after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) against Arsenal last Sunday. Guardiola described Rodri as “irreplaceable” and opted to change his formation in favour of a slightly more defensive set-up to make up for the Spaniard’s absence. Newcastle’s equaliser lit a fire in the hosts, and as they pushed for a winner, Guardiola was forced to change things again, with Phil Foden’s introduction giving City the control they had lacked at the start of the second half. Foden’s involvement also allowed more space for Haaland, who saw opportunities come his way later on, though he was unable to extend his recent hot streak in front of goal. Club reports

256,256,fulham,2025-03-16,"Fulham substitutes Rodrigo Muniz and Ryan Sessegnon did the damage late on as Marco Silva's team boosted their European hopes with a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Craven Cottage. Yet Fulham settled the contest in their favour with two late goals in the space of 10 minutes. Muniz broke the deadlock with a neat first-time finish and that paved the way for former Spurs man Sessegnon to curl in a sensational second goal in the 88th minute, securing the points for Marco Silva on his 200th Premier League match. Silva’s side climb to eighth place and four points off the top four, while Spurs remain 13th after their winless run in the league was extended to three games. How the match unfolded
The best opportunity of a scrappy first half fell to Fulham in the 34th minute. Ben Davies failed to deal with Alex Iwobi's centre, which he diverted straight to Timothy Castagne, but the full-back could only send a tame shot at Guglielmo Vicario. Bernd Leno parried Mathys Tel’s curling effort straight to substitute James Maddison, who helped the ball into the path of the striker, who fired over from close range. However, the breakthrough arrived in the 78th minute when Andreas Pereira teed up Muniz, who guided a cool effort beyond Vicario’s reach. Super subs strike again for Silva
Silva marked becoming only the second Portuguese manager after Jose Mourinho to oversee 200 Premier League games in style, as his team also got back on track after last week’s loss to Brighton & Hove Albion, leaving them well placed heading into the final international break of the season. The Fulham boss handed experienced head Willian a first top-flight start since his return to Craven Cottage, though he could not make the difference in a stuttering opening half in which both teams failed to generate much in the way of an attacking threat. The hosts did have the best opportunity before the break, though it was unfortunate Davies’ loose clearance fell to full-back Castagne, rather than one of Fulham’s attackers. But when Silva was needed in the second half, he got it spot on when turning to his substitutes. Fulham have now scored 13 goals via substitutes this season – more than any other side in the Premier League – and this victory keeps them right in the tussle for European qualification ahead of a trip to Arsenal after the international break. Sessegnon rubbed further salt into the wounds, while Solanke’s difficult day in front of goal was epitomised as he shot straight at Leno late on. Club reports

Spurs’ pre-international break hoodoo continues
After a run of three games without victory in all competitions, Spurs relieved some of the pressure with a comeback win over AZ in the Europa League in midweek. Yet Ange Postecoglou’s team simply could not build on that momentum, even if they did look brighter following the introductions of Son Heung-min and Lucas Bergvall at half-time. Spurs looked to be building up a head of steam at that stage, with Maddison aiding their attack too, but they were left stunned when Muniz struck at the other end. Games prior to international breaks have become something of a bugbear in recent times for Spurs, who have now lost each of their last six such matches. Club reports

Cameron Archer had opened the scoring for the hosts on eight minutes before Joe Aribo slotted home the second to double the lead 20 minutes later. Southampton are bottom of the table after failing to hold onto a point, while the Foxes move up to 14th. How the match unfolded
Southampton had already hit the bar through Aribo before Ryan Manning’s deflected cross found Archer in the centre of the box, and he helped it past Mads Hermansen eight minutes in. Kyle Walker-Peters orchestrated their second goal shortly after, cutting it back from the byline to Aribo, who side-footed it into the back of the net. Mary’s
In a stadium you might forgive for being subdued after picking up just one point in their opening seven matches, Southampton fans showed no such reserve. The 27-year-old earned a more direct involvement in the second, dragging it to the byline himself before picking out the perfect angle for the cutback and putting it on a plate for Aribo. Leicester were routinely carved open and looked vulnerable on every Southampton attack and particularly struggled to protect against the threat of the hosts’ left side. Yet Steve Cooper’s men slowly built their way back into the match as El Khannouss gave a warning to Southampton when he rattled the post. Club reports

But Facundo Buonanotte got Leicester back into the tie in the 64th minute before Ryan Fraser saw red and conceded a penalty, which Jamie Vardy scored. Ayew then completed the turnaround in the 8th minute of second-half stoppage time, driving a low shot into the bottom corner to seal a second consecutive win for Leicester. Southampton are bottom of the table after failing to hold onto a point, while the Foxes move up to 14th. How the match unfolded
Southampton had already hit the bar through Aribo before Ryan Manning’s deflected cross found Archer in the centre of the box, and he helped it past Mads Hermansen eight minutes in. Leicester’s lifeline came through substitute Abdul Fatawu, who ghosted his way to the byline before setting up Buonanotte to bundle it into the net. The 74th minute brought further drama as the visitors asked for a penalty for a shirt pull on Vardy, and it was awarded following a VAR review, with Fraser also receiving a straight red card for the foul. Vardy emphatically fired it in from the spot, before Harry Winks picked out an unmarked Ayew from a corner, and he coolly slotted it home. He was pivotal in both first-half goals, forming a partnership with Manning down the left that Leicester simply could not contain. His driving run in behind showed great composure to create the space for his left-wing partner, drawing the Leicester defenders to him for the first goal. Resurgent Foxes show grit
The visitors started their visit to St Mary’s with a limp display, looking like a team nowhere close to the pace of a Premier League match. Leicester were routinely carved open and looked vulnerable on every Southampton attack and particularly struggled to protect against the threat of the hosts’ left side. The Foxes looked a different animal after the break. Fatawu exemplified such an attitude when he unleashed a stunning shot from range that rattled the crossbar in the 71st minute, going millimetres away from an equaliser. In the end, it was innovation rather than tenacity that earned their winner as Winks spotted an unmarked Ayew at a corner, and he made no mistake with his chance. Club reports

While Man Utd move up to 13th, Leicester remain in 19th place, nine points from safety following Wolverhampton Wanderers' 2-1 win at Southampton on Saturday. How the match unfolded
After Christian Eriksen curled a sensational attempt against the woodwork from a short-corner routine, Man Utd scored their opener in the 28th minute as Hojlund received Fernandes’ pass, rode a challenge and drilled a low right-footed finish across Mads Hermansen. On his full Premier League debut, Man Utd defender Ayden Heaven made a fine block to deny Patson Daka before the break, though the youngster’s big game came to a premature end when he was carried off on a stretcher following the restart, after he fell awkwardly while preventing Daka from connecting with Jamie Vardy’s cross.

On his full Premier League debut, Man Utd defender Ayden Heaven made a fine block to deny Patson Daka before the break, though the youngster’s big game came to a premature end when he was carried off on a stretcher following the restart, after he fell awkwardly while preventing Daka from connecting with Jamie Vardy’s cross. Garnacho thought he had put the visitors 2-0 up shortly after, but the assistant’s offside flag stemmed his celebrations, with that decision confirmed by the VAR. Matthijs de Ligt’s brilliant block denied Facundo Buonanotte a swift response, paving the way for Fernandes to seal the victory late on with a brilliant finish from the edge of the box. United duo get a much-needed goal boost
It has been a difficult second season at Man Utd for Hojlund, who has just not been able to get going in front of goal. Hojlund seemed to have turned provider when he teed up Garnacho to cut in on his left foot and curl in a low strike after the break, though the offside flag meant there would be no assist for the former Atalanta man. Garnacho, though, ended a goalless streak of his own, and having two of his attackers back among the goals will be a real boost for Ruben Amorim, who will be targeting a top-half finish when the Premier League campaign resumes after the international break. Fernandes, of course, had to have the final say. No joy for Ruud against former club
In a real quirk of the record books, Ruud van Nistelrooy – who was in the Red Devils’ dugout when these teams met back in November – became the first manager to take charge of both clubs in a specific Premier League fixture in the same season since Alan Pardew in 2014/15 (Crystal Palace v Newcastle United). Vardy had an early snapshot that he sent straight at Andre Onana, who was helped out by De Ligt when Buonanotte threatened to score soon after Garnacho’s goal. Onana then made a big save late on to deny Vardy a consolation goal, and with Manchester City, Newcastle, Brighton & Hove Albion and Liverpool all to come in April, Leicester will need a huge turnaround in fortunes if they are to stay up.",Man Utd_2025-03-16,leicester-city,ruben-amorim,ruud-van-nistelrooy,3,0,29,2,0,46,0.91,0,18,3,4,6,461,20,6,0,0,5,1,8,5,7,11,0,1,17,1,2,359,25,33,31,0,52,11,32,24,6,20,9,59,31,0,3,0.3835,1,1,8,54,1.05,3,11,2,6,6,520,21,6,2,0,3,0,2,6,7,4,3,1,23,1,4,434,16,49,18,0,48,12,34,17,7,21,14,56,23,1,2,-1.3423,0,1,5
262,262,ipswich-town,2024-09-29,"Liam Delap scored twice as Ipswich Town claimed a confidence-boosting 2-2 draw with high-flying Aston Villa. But Delap, who had opened the scoring in the eighth minute at Portman Road, had other ideas. It is a draw that takes Ipswich into 15th place on four points, while Villa – who would have joined leaders Liverpool on 15 points had they held on – sit fifth. How the match unfolded
Ipswich wasted no time in getting the home fans on their feet. Jack Clarke, on his first Premier League start for Ipswich, cut back for Delap to slam in, with Emiliano Martinez unable to keep the low strike out. Clarke then spurned a good chance to restore Ipswich’s lead when he headed over from close range, but Watkins made no such mistake at the other end when he nodded in from Leon Bailey’s excellent right-wing cross in the 32nd minute. Pau Torres made a fantastic block to deny Wes Burns a winner, with Arijanet Muric called into action to keep out Ross Barkley’s rasping drive before Martinez held onto Jack Taylor’s fierce stoppage-time strike. Ipswich were comeback experts last season in the Championship, and Kieran McKenna’s team have now shown their courage in successive top-tier matches to salvage a point from each of them. Sam Morsy, their hero against Southampton last week, was perhaps fortunate to stay on the pitch this time out after a rash lunge on Jaden Philogene, but Ipswich made their luck count. All Ipswich need now is that first win of the campaign, and they will hope it comes against West Ham United next time out. While he would have probably been expected to make the diving save to his left to keep out Phillips’ first-time shot from the edge of the box, Martinez had little right to sprawl ahead of Delap and stick out a long left leg to divert the Ipswich striker’s attempt wide in a one-v-one, with Ipswich having found a way beyond Villa’s high line. Martinez was hardly to blame when Delap dragged Ipswich level, and though Unai Emery will no doubt be annoyed that his team could not hold on, in the Argentinian, he has one of the best in the business to call on, with a UEFA Champions League encounter against Bayern Munich coming up before Villa’s next top-flight match, against Manchester United.

263,263,aston-villa,2024-09-29,"Liam Delap scored twice as Ipswich Town claimed a confidence-boosting 2-2 draw with high-flying Aston Villa. Villa looked set to forge another comeback win in the Premier League when Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins propelled them into the lead. It is a draw that takes Ipswich into 15th place on four points, while Villa – who would have joined leaders Liverpool on 15 points had they held on – sit fifth. Jack Clarke, on his first Premier League start for Ipswich, cut back for Delap to slam in, with Emiliano Martinez unable to keep the low strike out. Villa were behind for only seven minutes, though, with Rogers lashing home after capitalising on Jacob Greaves’ poor clearance – the goal confirmed after a VAR check for handball. Clarke then spurned a good chance to restore Ipswich’s lead when he headed over from close range, but Watkins made no such mistake at the other end when he nodded in from Leon Bailey’s excellent right-wing cross in the 32nd minute. A pair of brilliant Martinez stops thwarted Kalvin Phillips and Delap respectively, though he could do nothing to prevent the latter from doubling his tally to restore parity in the 72nd minute. Pau Torres made a fantastic block to deny Wes Burns a winner, with Arijanet Muric called into action to keep out Ross Barkley’s rasping drive before Martinez held onto Jack Taylor’s fierce stoppage-time strike. Martinez might have done better to prevent the opener, but Delap’s equaliser was a thing of beauty as he drove into Villa’s box, left Carlos in his wake with a stepover and then coolly dispatched into the opposite corner to seal his first career double in a league match. It could easily have been a hat-trick, too, if not for Martinez’s excellence after Villa had gone 2-1 up. Martinez makes amends
Martinez has recently been hit with an international ban for his overly zealous celebrations in the wake of Argentina’s Copa America triumph earlier this year, and there is no doubt Villa’s goalkeeper wears his heart on his sleeve. While he would have probably been expected to make the diving save to his left to keep out Phillips’ first-time shot from the edge of the box, Martinez had little right to sprawl ahead of Delap and stick out a long left leg to divert the Ipswich striker’s attempt wide in a one-v-one, with Ipswich having found a way beyond Villa’s high line. Martinez was hardly to blame when Delap dragged Ipswich level, and though Unai Emery will no doubt be annoyed that his team could not hold on, in the Argentinian, he has one of the best in the business to call on, with a UEFA Champions League encounter against Bayern Munich coming up before Villa’s next top-flight match, against Manchester United.

264,264,manchester-united,2024-09-29,"Tottenham Hotspur thrashed 10-man Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday, adding pressure on manager Erik ten Hag. Micky van de Ven opened up United’s defence with a blistering run to set up Brennan Johnson with just three minutes on the clock, and it never got better for United from then on. Bruno Fernandes received a straight red card in the 42nd minute for a late tackle on James Maddison, giving United a mountain to climb. Ange Postecoglou’s side rise to eighth with 10 points, while United slip to 12th, behind Brentford on goal difference. How the match unfolded
Van de Ven set the stage for a brilliant Spurs display when he pounced on Marcus Rashford’s loose touch before marauding 70 yards to the byline and teeing up Johnson for the simplest of back-post tap-ins. Andre Onana kept United in the contest, making two smothering saves to deny Maddison and Timo Werner either side of Johnson striking the foot of the post. Alejandro Garnacho volleyed the hosts’ best chance of the first half against the upright, but their day soon got worse as Fernandes received the first red card of his United career, his foot slipping as he stretched so he caught Maddison high on the shin, with VAR confirming the referee’s decision to show a red card. Johnson was involved in another early goal after the break, racing down the right to tee Kulusevski up, who flicked the ball over Onana in the 47th minute. United were indebted to their goalkeeper as he made a fine double save to keep out Werner and Solanke soon after, but he was helpless as the latter stretched to direct Pape Sarr’s flick-on into the net to round off a miserable afternoon for Ten Hag. No let up for Ten Hag
There is little reprieve in the Premier League, and after an up-and-down start to the season, Ten Hag finds himself coming under increasing pressure. There were flashes of promise in the first half, with Joshua Zirkzee poking a first-time shot at Guglielmo Vicario before Garnacho struck the woodwork. But their hopes of a comeback were hampered when Fernandes received his marching orders, compounding the captain’s poor start to the season. Mason Mount and Casemiro were introduced to steady the ship, but Spurs were always in control, with Kulusevski and Solanke making sure the scoreline reflected their dominance, even as Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez and Rasmus Hojlund squandered chances for a United consolation. Ten Hag is no stranger to scrutiny since taking the job at Old Trafford, but after failing to win any of the last three matches in all competitions and with tricky tests against Porto and Aston Villa in the Europa League and Premier League respectively coming up, he will be hoping to find a solution quickly. Postecoglou will perhaps be left scratching his head as to how they did not score more as they ran riot in the final third, their front three along with Maddison and Kulusevski providing constant outlets as Onana made big saves to keep the scoreline down, while Sarr headed wide late on too.

There is little reprieve in the Premier League, and after an up-and-down start to the season, Ten Hag finds himself coming under increasing pressure. After their 3-0 loss to Liverpool, Red Devils had kept consecutive top-flight clean sheets and looked to be improving on the defensive problems that plagued them last season, but Spurs’ pace in behind saw them come undone time and time again. But their hopes of a comeback were hampered when Fernandes received his marching orders, compounding the captain’s poor start to the season. Mason Mount and Casemiro were introduced to steady the ship, but Spurs were always in control, with Kulusevski and Solanke making sure the scoreline reflected their dominance, even as Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez and Rasmus Hojlund squandered chances for a United consolation. Son-less Spurs shrug off away day blues
Postecoglou may have played down the seriousness of Son Heung-min’s injury from Spurs’ Europa League tie on Thursday, but when the Tottenham captain was left out of the squad, it was certainly seen as a blow to the visitors. The absence of their most creative player so far this season did not affect Spurs in any way though, as they made a lightning-quick start, mainly thanks to Van de Ven’s assertiveness and searing pace. Postecoglou will perhaps be left scratching his head as to how they did not score more as they ran riot in the final third, their front three along with Maddison and Kulusevski providing constant outlets as Onana made big saves to keep the scoreline down, while Sarr headed wide late on too. But, with a first away win of the Premier League season under their belt, Postecoglou has solved a big problem, and just in time with a trip to Brighton Spurs’ next task in the top flight.

266,266,newcastle-united,2024-10-19,"Brighton & Hove Albion surged to within touching distance of the Premier League's top four after Danny Welbeck proved the difference in a battling 1-0 away win over Newcastle United. Fabian Hurzeler's side rescued a remarkable 3-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, and left St James' Park with another impressive three points on Saturday. Newcastle threatened in the opening stages but Welbeck punished Eddie Howe's hosts slack defending with a well-taken 35th-minute opener after linking up with Georginio Rutter. Bart Verbruggen's brilliant resistance kept Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon at bay, while Dan Burn saw a late finish ruled out for offside as Brighton moved into fifth – two points adrift of the top four. How the match unfolded
Newcastle came flying out the blocks as Isak saw a rasping effort blocked by team-mate Jacob Murphy, before the Sweden striker missed a presentable opening from Bruno Guimaraes' flick-on. A sprawling Verbruggen denied Isak when one-on-one just after the half-hour mark before Brighton scored against the run of play, Welbeck playing a one-two with in-form Rutter before poking past Nick Pope. Verbruggen again impressed when denying Gordon's whipped attempt before half-time, while Lewis Dunk blazed over from Yasin Ayari's corner after the break. Brighton continued to hold on as Isak and Joelinton were somehow denied in quick succession, with Gordon also firing straight at Verbruggen after Fabian Schar's incisive long ball through the middle. How did Newcastle lose?
Howe will have been relieved to welcome back Isak, who missed the draws with Manchester City and Everton due to a broken toe, enabling him to move Gordon back to his usual left-wing position. Though Gordon scored from the penalty spot against City, before missing against his former club at Goodison Park, Newcastle appeared a different side with a recognised striker in the form of Isak. Sandro Tonali's slick pass down the centre should have brought the opener after 33 minutes, though Isak fired straight at the onrushing Verbruggen with a finish befitting his lack of match sharpness. Gordon acted as the makeshift striker in Isak's absence but found more joy in a familiar wide position, forcing Verbruggen into a smart stop when cutting in from his favoured left-hand side late in the first half. The England winger should have netted after the interval, too, but headed over when unchallenged from Isak's delicate delivery before rushing a glorious opportunity after Schar's long pass caught Brighton off-guard. The return of Isak presents attacking solutions for Howe's side – who rarely looked troubled in defence – but Newcastle must improve significantly in front of goal before their next trip to Chelsea. That decision saw Ayari start as an unconvincing left-wing option in front of makeshift full-back Ferdi Kadioglu, and the pair struggled to cope with a rampant Newcastle start. Hurzeler's side defended valiantly, however, and were once again thankful to Welbeck and Rutter – the heroes against Spurs – when the duo linked up from a long free-kick before intricate passes freed Welbeck to squeeze past Pope.

Brighton continued to hold on as Isak and Joelinton were somehow denied in quick succession, with Gordon also firing straight at Verbruggen after Fabian Schar's incisive long ball through the middle. Burn was comfortably offside when lobbing Verbruggen in the dying stages, but victory came at a cost for Brighton as Welbeck left the pitch on a stretcher with nine minutes remaining after a seemingly innocuous clash with Schar. The England winger should have netted after the interval, too, but headed over when unchallenged from Isak's delicate delivery before rushing a glorious opportunity after Schar's long pass caught Brighton off-guard. Brighton show different side
Yankuba Minteh and Kaoru Mitoma were pivotal as Brighton produced a memorable comeback against Spurs, but Hurzeler left the pair on the bench here after a short turnaround from their international duties. Dunk should have extended Brighton's lead after the interval, but he failed to make the most of a gilt-edged set-piece opportunity when hooking over a right-footed volley. The visitors continued to look a threat on the counter-attack, with Mitoma and Mats Wieffer denied by Pope, yet this battling performance was in stark contrast to their usual free-flowing style. Hurzeler's refusal to adapt from his high-line defensive tactic brought some questions early in his tenure, but this victory – aided by the heroics of Verbruggen – may show the German can adapt ahead of Brighton's next task against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

268,268,everton,2025-03-15,"Jake O’Brien’s late header saw Everton salvage a 1-1 draw against West Ham United and stretch their Premier League unbeaten run to nine matches. David Moyes was staring down the barrel of a defeat to his former club, but like he did against Brentford towards the end of February, O’Brien was on hand to earn a share of the spoils for the Toffees. Tomas Soucek, who netted in West Ham’s 3-1 win in the corresponding fixture last season, broke the deadlock with a fine finish in the 67th minute at Goodison Park. But Everton’s pressure told when O’Brien headed home from Idrissa Gueye’s volleyed centre in the 91st minute, and the hosts could then have won it with virtually the last kick of the game, only for Carlos Alcaraz to drag wide. The draw moves Everton above Manchester United – who play on Sunday – into 14th, two places above West Ham courtesy of a better goal difference. How the match unfolded
West Ham might have taken an early lead when James Ward-Prowse’s whipped corner flicked off Jarrad Branthwaite, but Jordan Pickford pulled off a stunning one-handed save to spare his team-mate’s blushes. Jarrod Bowen forced Pickford into another good save in the 28th minute, though Everton thought they had a golden chance to go ahead when they were awarded a penalty on the stroke of half-time. But it was West Ham who struck first when Bowen danced between Everton’s defence and slipped it into Soucek, who duly curled a low effort into the right-hand corner. Moyes threw on Armando Broja and Youssef Chermiti as Everton searched for an equaliser, with the latter seeing a strike well saved by Alphonse Areola. Moyes’ men just don’t give up
Moyes’ side arrived at Goodison Park brimming with confidence, the Scot freshly crowned Barclays Manager of the Month for February. Everton’s manager, of course, knows West Ham better than most. But this was not a vintage performance from the Toffees. Playing out wide, Alcaraz found his influence limited, though, and it was telling that Everton improved once they had gone behind and Moyes moved the former Southampton playmaker central. And under Moyes, Everton just do not give in. Everton have matched their best unbeaten streak in the Premier League, which was previously set between December 2016 and February 2017, and are now 17 points above the relegation zone. Potter shuffled his starting line-up for the trip to Goodison Park, with Lucas Paqueta’s return from injury a boost, and West Ham will likely consider themselves unfortunate not to have gone into the break ahead, as they were frustrated by Pickford. There was nothing Everton’s goalkeeper could do to deny Soucek the opener, though – the Czech showing once again just how crucial he is to West Ham’s attack. Wolves are next up for West Ham, and Potter will be aiming for his team – who like Everton, are well clear of the bottom three – to round out the season in some confidence. Club reports

270,270,manchester-city,2025-03-15,"Brighton & Hove Albion fought back twice to draw 2-2 at Manchester City as the two clubs continue to battle for UEFA Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola's hosts knew a victory would take them above fourth-placed Chelsea, while Brighton had the chance to leapfrog Man City, but both sides had to settle for a point. Erling Haaland converted from the penalty spot and Omar Marmoush scored with a 20-yard drive either side of Pervis Estupinan's wonderful free-kick. Brighton remain seventh in the table, one point behind Man City, who stay fifth. Man City swiftly hit the front at the other end when Adam Webster conceded a penalty with his scything challenge on Marmoush, and Haaland confidently found the bottom-right corner. Estupinan levelled in the 21st minute with a delightful free-kick that went in off the far post, but Marmoush re-established City's advantage with an excellent strike from the edge of the box six minutes before half-time. City survived a major scare when Joao Pedro rolled an effort narrowly wide just before the break, but Brighton levelled in the 49th minute when Jack Hinshelwood's shot on the turn deflected in off Khusanov for an own goal. It was Brighton who missed the clearest opportunity, with Carlos Baleba letting City off the hook when he blasted over from a great position late on. Marmoush shows promise but Man City slip up
Guardiola responded to last week's 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest by making four changes to his line-up. Only one of those – Ortega replacing Ederson in goal – was enforced as Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva and Matheus Nunes dropped to the bench. Marmoush, Ilkay Gundogan and Rico Lewis were recalled, and the former made a speedy impact to win City's penalty. Having linked up well with Haaland, the Egyptian left Webster bamboozled with a clever turn and was chopped down. Haaland made no mistake, slotting home for his 84th goal in 94 Premier League appearances. Haaland benefited from having a foil in attack, with Marmoush almost playing as a second striker. But Marmoush is just as comfortable operating outside the area, as he showed when rifling a shot off the left-hand post and into the net to put City 2-1 up. Marmoush's partnership with Haaland looks promising, and he also appears to have struck up a solid understanding with Gundogan, who assisted him here after also teeing the Egyptian for one of his three goals against Newcastle United last month. But while there were positive signs in attack, City struggled at the back. Some poor set-piece defending led to Khusanov's own goal, and they have now conceded 40 top-flight goals this season, which is already their most in any Premier League campaign under Guardiola. City have an extended break to work on plugging their leaky defence before a key FA Cup quarter-final against AFC Bournemouth, after which they face struggling Leicester City in their next league game on 2 April. Seagulls stick to their task
Fabian Hurzeler's Brighton travelled to the Etihad Stadium in excellent spirits, chasing a seventh successive victory in all competitions and a fifth in a row in the Premier League. The away side knew a victory over City would ensure they ended the weekend fifth in the table – a position that will likely be enough for Champions League qualification, given the strong performances of English clubs in Europe this season. They could have been discouraged after City's second goal, which came from Georginio Rutter being dispossessed by Nico in a dangerous area, but they stuck to their task impressively. Club reports

Pep Guardiola's hosts knew a victory would take them above fourth-placed Chelsea, while Brighton had the chance to leapfrog Man City, but both sides had to settle for a point. However, Abdukodir Khusanov's own goal made it 2-2 early in the second half and Brighton missed a big chance to score a late winner. Brighton remain seventh in the table, one point behind Man City, who stay fifth. How the match unfolded
Brighton thought they had a sixth-minute opener when Kaoru Mitoma bundled the ball home, but referee Simon Hooper ruled he had nodded the ball out of Stefan Ortega's hands. City survived a major scare when Joao Pedro rolled an effort narrowly wide just before the break, but Brighton levelled in the 49th minute when Jack Hinshelwood's shot on the turn deflected in off Khusanov for an own goal. Both sides had chances at 2-2 as Yankuba Minteh somehow failed to turn Diego Gomez's cross in for Brighton, while Nico Gonzalez's downward header rattled a post at the other end. It was Brighton who missed the clearest opportunity, with Carlos Baleba letting City off the hook when he blasted over from a great position late on. Seagulls stick to their task
Fabian Hurzeler's Brighton travelled to the Etihad Stadium in excellent spirits, chasing a seventh successive victory in all competitions and a fifth in a row in the Premier League. It has been a real turnaround for the Seagulls, who went eight league games without a win either side of Christmas and were routed 7-0 by Forest as recently as last month. Brighton remain right in the mix to finish in one of those top places despite falling just short of victory. The visitors got a huge slice of fortune for their second equaliser, but that was the least they deserved from a positive second-half display, and some more composed finishing would have earned them three points, with Hurzeler visibly frustrated when Baleba could not convert late on after being set up by Joao Pedro. While Brighton were unable to earn a club-record fifth straight win in the top flight, they remain strong contenders for European qualification and have an FA Cup quarter-final against Forest to come after the international break, before a crunch league match with Aston Villa.

The visitors restored their three-goal advantage five minutes later through Jota Silva, but the scoring was not done there, with George Hirst’s header restoring some pride for Ipswich late on. The result moves Forest onto 54 points in third, while Ipswich stay in 18th, now nine points adrift of safety following Wolverhampton Wanderers’ win over Southampton. How the match unfolded
Ipswich’s inability to clear from a Forest corner was ruthlessly punished in the 35th minute when Milenkovic rifled the ball home after Liam Delap’s poor attempt to head it away. The Forest attacker then profited from some more slack Ipswich defending, racing onto Milenkovic’s long ball forward before finishing past Alex Palmer. Kieran McKenna’s team improved after the break and got their goal eight minutes from time when Cajuste gathered Jack Clarke’s pass outside of the area to send the ball into the top-right corner. Silva then rounded off a fine counter-attack, profiting from acres of space, but Ipswich substitute Hirst reduced the arrears in second-half stoppage time with a fine header from Dara O'Shea’s cross. Ipswich’s wait for a victory goes on
Though Ipswich showed signs of improvement on Saturday, they are still the only side across England’s top-four tiers yet to register a victory in 2025. Ipswich had made a strong start but looked like a team who had scored just 28 goals this season, failing to create any chances of note early on. And, with only Southampton conceding more this season than the Tractor Boys prior to kick-off, their defensive woes continued. Ipswich's improvement after half-time was clear, as Omari Hutchinson saw his deflected strike saved by Sels, while Delap was unable to guide a header from Leif Davis’ inviting corner on target, though they would get their rewards late on with a moment of quality from Cajuste. Though they conceded a fourth goal, Ipswich showed the grit and determination to bite back at Forest through Hirst, and those characteristics will need to be on show for their remaining nine matches if they are to stand any chance of not returning to the Championship. The final international break of the season allows Ipswich to regroup ahead of the run-in but make the trip to in-form AFC Bournemouth on their return to Premier League action. Club reports

In Nuno Espirito Santo's 50th Premier League match in charge of Forest, Nikola Milenkovic got the first of three goals in six minutes before half-time with a fierce finish from inside the box. Anthony Elanga then grabbed a brilliant brace to complete the first-half rout. Forest’s solid defensive rearguard was eventually breached late on, Jens Cajuste neatly turning substitute Ryan Yates before curling the ball beyond Matz Sels. The result moves Forest onto 54 points in third, while Ipswich stay in 18th, now nine points adrift of safety following Wolverhampton Wanderers’ win over Southampton. How the match unfolded
Ipswich’s inability to clear from a Forest corner was ruthlessly punished in the 35th minute when Milenkovic rifled the ball home after Liam Delap’s poor attempt to head it away. Two goals in four minutes at the end of the first half from Elanga put the result beyond doubt, with the Swede notching his first with a fine curling effort. The Forest attacker then profited from some more slack Ipswich defending, racing onto Milenkovic’s long ball forward before finishing past Alex Palmer. Milenkovic’s opener was down to poor miscommunication, with Palmer rushing out of his goal and cannoning the ball off Cajuste, a mistake that proved costly as Forest went ahead from the resulting corner, though the hosts had their chances to clear before conceding. Though they conceded a fourth goal, Ipswich showed the grit and determination to bite back at Forest through Hirst, and those characteristics will need to be on show for their remaining nine matches if they are to stand any chance of not returning to the Championship. Nuno enjoys landmark Forest outing
Nuno’s appointment at the City Ground was met with raised eyebrows back in December 2023, but across the 51-year-old’s half-century of Premier League matches at the helm, the Portuguese has turned Forest from relegation strugglers to UEFA Champions League believers. Three quick goals at the end of the first half did the damage for Forest, whose victory saw them go within a point of second-placed Arsenal in the standings, a statement not many would have believed at the start of the season. But Forest were made to work for their opening, registering the game’s first shot on target in the 33rd minute when Chris Wood’s header from Morgan Gibbs-White’s pinpoint cross from the right-hand side was comfortably gathered by Palmer. Those goals from Milenkovic and Elanga allowed Forest to protect their lead in the second half, though one of the division’s sternest defences will not have been happy at conceding two late goals, even if the most important factor was the three points. The industrious Gibbs-White also impressed, showcasing what new England head coach Thomas Tuchel is missing after being left out of the recent Three Lions squad. But Forest will have their captain well-rested ahead of their return to action against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup quarter-finals after the international break. Club reports

274,274,manchester-united,2024-10-19,"Rasmus Hojlund's first Premier League goal of the season helped to ease the pressure on manager Erik ten Hag as Manchester United claimed an important 2-1 victory over Brentford. United needed two stoppage-time goals to beat the Bees on their last visit to Old Trafford in October 2023, and their powers of recovery were required again on Saturday. Alejandro Garnacho levelled with a fine volley before Bruno Fernandes' delicate flick teed up Rasmus Hojlund for the winner, his first Premier League goal of 2024/25. United leapfrog their opponents with the victory and move into the top half with 11 points from eight matches. Flekken was then worked at his near post by Fernandes, before Andre Onana went one better at the other end with a stunning save from Christian Norgaard's dipping strike. United were hit with a sucker punch on the stroke of half-time, Pinnock heading Mikkel Damsgaard's corner home after Matthijs de Ligt was forced off temporarily due to a head injury. However, United were level within two minutes of the restart, Garnacho scoring with a brilliant back-post volley from Marcus Rashford's cross. United upped the ante from there, and the pressure paid off shortly after the hour mark as Hojlund latched onto Fernandes' backheel before coolly lobbing Flekken. With United's confidence growing, Flekken made a big save to deny Diogo Dalot, and there was to be no late twist as Ten Hag's men held on for a morale-boosting win. History repeats itself for United
Last October, United welcomed Brentford to Old Trafford following back-to-back defeats, for a match that felt potentially decisive for their under-fire boss Ten Hag. On that occasion, two stoppage-time strikes from Scott McTominay overturned Mathias Jensen's opener and handed Ten Hag's side a huge victory, giving the Dutchman some temporary respite. After a week in which Ten Hag accused members of the media of inventing 'lies and fairytales' about his reign, there was a sense of déjà vu on Saturday, with Brentford threatening to inflict another humiliation on his team before they rescued the points. The hosts produced another disjointed performance in the first half, with the absence of injured midfielder Kobbie Mainoo disrupting their balance as Casemiro and Christian Eriksen were overrun. But Ten Hag's United have a knack for coming up with a result when matters look bleak, and their individual quality shone through in the second half, most obviously in Garnacho's thumping equaliser and Fernandes' cultured assist for Hojlund. With fixtures against West Ham and Leicester City – as well as a blockbuster clash with Chelsea – to come in the next three weeks, Ten Hag will hope this victory can serve as a turning point. The Bees buzzed around United in the opening period, not giving the hosts' short-handed midfield a moment's peace and looking to feed Mbeumo whenever possible. Club reports

Ethan Pinnock headed Brentford into the lead five minutes into first-half stoppage time, but two moments of individual class turned the game around in the second half. Brentford, meanwhile, are one point further back in 12th place. How the match unfolded
Brentford almost fell behind in bizarre fashion midway through the first half as Mark Flekken dropped a cross against Hojlund before scooping the ball off the line.

After a week in which Ten Hag accused members of the media of inventing 'lies and fairytales' about his reign, there was a sense of déjà vu on Saturday, with Brentford threatening to inflict another humiliation on his team before they rescued the points. Bees pegged back again
Having scored in the second minute or earlier in four straight Premier League games before this one, Brentford left it late to hit the front by their standards, with Pinnock taking advantage of some static set-piece defending in first-half stoppage time. However, the contest had been flipped on its head within 17 minutes of the restart, with manager Thomas Frank, who has now lost 50 matches in the top flight, left to rue yet another lost lead. Brentford dropped a Premier League-high 30 points from winning positions in 2023/24, and no team has dropped more than their 11 already in 2024/25, having also let leads slip against Manchester City, Tottenham and West Ham. The Bees buzzed around United in the opening period, not giving the hosts' short-handed midfield a moment's peace and looking to feed Mbeumo whenever possible. However, Mbeumo was effectively contained by Dalot after the break, with Brentford's lengthy injury list limiting their attacking options. Yoane Wissa's return from the bench will certainly be a welcome sight for Frank, though, as his team look ahead to a fixture against Ipswich Town at the Gtech Community Stadium next week.

276,276,bournemouth,2024-09-30,"Evanilson scored his first AFC Bournemouth goal while Dango Ouattara and Antoine Semenyo were also on target as south-coast rivals Southampton were brushed aside in a routine 3-1 victory. Brazilian forward Evanilson steered past ex-Cherries goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale on 17 minutes at the Vitality Stadium on Monday thanks to Marcus Tavernier's quick thinking. Ouattara was credited with Bournemouth's second and Semenyo clinched the third in a wonderful first-half performance with a fine solo effort. Bournemouth's first home win of the season moves them 11th in the Premier League standings, while Southampton are 19th with just a solitary point from six matches. How the match unfolded
The hosts caught Saints napping for the opener when Tavernier dinked a quick free-kick into the area and Evanilson expertly guided his volley into the bottom-left corner. It sparked a period of dominance from the hosts and they doubled their lead when Lewis Cook's shot, from Semenyo's cutback, hit Ouattara and diverted beyond Ramsdale. Bournemouth forwards' delight as Evanilson gets off the mark
Bournemouth forked out a reported £40. 2million to Porto for Evanilson in the summer transfer window as they sought a replacement for Dominic Solanke, who was sold to Tottenham Hotspur. The 24-year-old failed to score in his first four Premier League appearances and missed a penalty as the Cherries fell to a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea earlier this month. But there were no signs of a forward lacking in confidence when he brilliantly steered home after showing an almost telepathic understanding with Tavernier. Andoni Iraola, watching from the stands as he served a touchline ban, will hope it can spark a run of form for Evanilson, who was also denied in a one-on-one in the second half. Evanilson will certainly get chances if Ouattara and Semenyo can continue to show the sort of form they did here as Bournemouth earned a first home win over Southampton since 2016. They may no longer have Solanke but there is plenty of talent to admire in this Cherries front line. Saints just can't get marching

Taylor Harwood-Bellis reduced the areas early in a second half in which Southampton, to their credit, showed some fighting spirit, but it could not repair the damage of a disappointing opening 45 minutes. Bournemouth's first home win of the season moves them 11th in the Premier League standings, while Southampton are 19th with just a solitary point from six matches. How the match unfolded
The hosts caught Saints napping for the opener when Tavernier dinked a quick free-kick into the area and Evanilson expertly guided his volley into the bottom-left corner. Harwood-Bellis stooped low to nod in from Mateus Fernandes' deflected cross five minutes after the restart, having been brilliantly denied by Kepa Arrizabalaga just prior, to give Southampton hope. Substitute Ben Brereton Diaz bent an effort wide of the right post and brilliant defending from Milos Kerkez denied Yukinari Sugawara a simple finish as Southampton fought in vain to create a nervy ending. Evanilson will certainly get chances if Ouattara and Semenyo can continue to show the sort of form they did here as Bournemouth earned a first home win over Southampton since 2016. Saints just can't get marching
One of the pre-match narratives surrounded Ryan Fraser's first return to the Vitality Stadium since an acrimonious exit in 2020. The Saints winger was loudly booed every time he went near the ball but he was denied by Kepa after Maxwel Cornet had already seen an effort deflected wide as part of a bright start from the visitors. But soon enough chants of ""Fraser, what's the score?"" were ringing out from the terraces as Southampton - still winless since returning to the top flight - completely lost control of the match. While Evanilson will rightly take credit for a fine opener, question marks will be asked of how the Southampton defence just completely lost concentration, too. A triple substitution at the break, which saw Brereton Diaz, Joe Aribo and Ross Stewart enter the fray, brought about a spirited second-half showing, which yielded Harwood-Bellis' goal. In truth, though, the damage was done by a first-half horror show that will leave boss Russell Martin needing to go back to the drawing board. Club reports

278,278,fulham,2024-10-19,"Aston Villa climbed back into the Premier League's top four after coming from behind to beat Fulham 3-1 in an entertaining clash at Craven Cottage that saw both teams finish with 10 men. Fulham threatened regularly in the first half but were ultimately made to pay for their profligacy, as Jimenez headed a glorious opportunity wide from four yards out, before Andreas Pereira had a penalty saved by Emiliano Martinez. Unai Emery's side also finished a man down after substitute Jaden Philogene was sent off late on, but they move up to fourth in the league table on 17 points, a total that is now six higher than Fulham, who drop to ninth after a second straight defeat. Jimenez showed great strength to hold off Pau Torres and latch onto goalkeeper Bernd Leno's long kick before drilling past Martinez. However, the visitors were level just four minutes later, neatly working their way from one end to the other, before Rogers' shot wrong-footed Leno via a heavy Calvin Bassey deflection. Fulham spurned two golden opportunities to regain their advantage before the break. First, Jimenez headed wide and, after Matty Cash was penalised for handball following a VAR review, Pereira's tame 27th-minute spot-kick was comfortably gathered by Martinez. And Fulham’s quest to get back into the contest then became even harder when Andersen was dismissed for bringing down Watkins, who was racing clear in the 65th minute. Fulham rue missed opportunities once more
For their second Premier League match in succession, Fulham were left to wonder what might have been. Before the international break, Marco Silva's side struck first against Manchester City and should have extended their lead and potentially claimed all three points at the Etihad Stadium. Two weeks on, though they were pegged back again, Fulham created opportunities to regain their advantage, but did not take the most glaring through Jimenez's close-range header and Pereira's tame penalty. Having now lost two in a row, next week’s trip to Goodison Park to face Everton has just become a lot more important if Silva wants to maintain some kind of momentum from what had been an impressive start to the campaign. After doing so, Villa went through the gears in the second half and impressively limited Fulham’s attacking impact. Club reports

279,279,aston-villa,2024-10-19,"Aston Villa climbed back into the Premier League's top four after coming from behind to beat Fulham 3-1 in an entertaining clash at Craven Cottage that saw both teams finish with 10 men. There was a frantic start to the match, with Villa attacker Morgan Rogers cancelling out Raul Jimenez's earlier goal inside the opening nine minutes. Fulham threatened regularly in the first half but were ultimately made to pay for their profligacy, as Jimenez headed a glorious opportunity wide from four yards out, before Andreas Pereira had a penalty saved by Emiliano Martinez. Villa capitalised when Ollie Watkins put them in front for the first time just before the hour-mark and, shortly after Joachim Andersen's straight red card, an Issa Diop own goal put the result beyond doubt. Unai Emery's side also finished a man down after substitute Jaden Philogene was sent off late on, but they move up to fourth in the league table on 17 points, a total that is now six higher than Fulham, who drop to ninth after a second straight defeat. Jimenez showed great strength to hold off Pau Torres and latch onto goalkeeper Bernd Leno's long kick before drilling past Martinez. First, Jimenez headed wide and, after Matty Cash was penalised for handball following a VAR review, Pereira's tame 27th-minute spot-kick was comfortably gathered by Martinez. Villa capitalised, with Watkins powering home a header from Youri Tielemans' near-post corner. And Fulham’s quest to get back into the contest then became even harder when Andersen was dismissed for bringing down Watkins, who was racing clear in the 65th minute. The let-offs sparked Villa back into life and they sounded a warning when Rogers was unable to convert a decent chance just before half-time. Villa enjoy another successful trip to capital
Villa arrived in London on a run of eight victories from their last 12 Premier League games in the capital. Emery’s side were also on an eight-match unbeaten streak across all competitions, a run which included their famous UEFA Champions League win over Bayern Munich, and there was no panic in their ranks when they fell behind after just five minutes. After doing so, Villa went through the gears in the second half and impressively limited Fulham’s attacking impact. They were thoroughly deserving of their lead by the time England international Watkins brilliantly headed in from Tielemans' corner to make it five goals in as many Premier League games. And it was from another cross that the third goal arrived, as Diop put through his own net to ensure yet another win for Villa in London. Emery’s men now have three home games in three different competitions to negotiate, but their next away fixture is another trip to the capital, a crucial match against Tottenham Hotspur on 3 November.

280,280,tottenham-hotspur,2024-10-19,"Tottenham Hotspur scored three goals in eight second-half minutes to beat West Ham United 4-1, bouncing back after throwing away a two-goal lead and losing to Brighton & Hove Albion before the international break. Ange Postecoglou surprisingly withdrew James Maddison at half-time, but that change paid off as Spurs swiftly pulled clear. Yves Bissouma swept home in the 52nd minute. Then goalkeeper Alphonse Areola scored an own goal in the 55th minute, before Son Heung-min struck the third goal in the 60th minute that settled the contest. To add to West Ham's woes, Kudus was sent off late on as they drop to 15th in the Premier League table with eight points from as many matches, while Spurs go seventh with 13. Brennan Johnson was guilty of a glaring miss when he nodded Destiny Udogie's cross wide, but Spurs did level in the 36th minute, Kulusevski's strike hitting both posts and crossing the line despite West Ham goalkeeper Areola getting fingertips to it. Pedro Porro sent a scissor kick wide shortly before half-time, but Spurs' relentless pressure was rewarded soon after the interval with Bissouma side-footing in after excellent combination play from Son and Udogie. Spurs' third goal came in fortuitous fashion as Son's shot deflected off Jean-Clair Todibo and Areola before squirming over the line. Son clipped the foot of the post one minute later, and West Ham's miserable outing was capped when Kudus saw red for violent conduct. Postecoglou's change pays off
Coming after a 3-0 rout of Manchester United at Old Trafford, Spurs' 3-2 defeat at Brighton last time out led many to describe Postecoglou's style as reckless, rather than entertaining. However, for as bad as Spurs were in the second half at Amex Stadium, they were excellent after the break here, with a surprise half-time switch the catalyst. Maddison played a key role in Kulusevski's leveller, capitalising on a West Ham turnover to drive over halfway and find the Swede near the right corner of the box, yet he did not emerge for the second half as Postecoglou chose to introduce Pape Sarr. His clever reverse pass played in Son to force the own goal, while it was Sarr who provided the assist when Son made it 4-1 on the hour-mark, his pinpoint pass allowing the Spurs skipper to drive at Areola and arrow his finish inside the near post. Postecoglou now has a selection headache ahead of next week's trip to Crystal Palace, with Kulusevski staking his claim for a central role and Sarr bringing fresh energy to the midfield. The Julen Lopetegui era appeared to have lift-off when Kudus gave them a surprise lead against Spurs, the winger scoring for a second straight match, but the Hammers' defence began to creak under constant pressure and they could have no complaints when Kulusevski equalised. Bissouma was granted the freedom of the penalty area to score Spurs' second goal, and the subsequent mix-up between Areola and Todibo summed up the visitors' performance. To add to Lopetegui's frustrations, Spurs' third goal came just as he was readying a triple substitution in a bid to turn the tide. In the end, West Ham were arguably fortunate to limit their hosts to four goals, with Kulusevski, Johnson and Timo Werner all passing up late chances. Johnson also should have scored in the opening period. Club reports

The visitors struck first in the 18th minute when Jarrod Bowen showed great tenacity to keep an attack alive before crossing for Kudus, who scored at the far post. Brennan Johnson was guilty of a glaring miss when he nodded Destiny Udogie's cross wide, but Spurs did level in the 36th minute, Kulusevski's strike hitting both posts and crossing the line despite West Ham goalkeeper Areola getting fingertips to it.

No lift-off for Lopetegui
Having thrashed Ipswich Town 4-1 prior to the international break, West Ham were eyeing their first back-to-back Premier League victories since March. The Julen Lopetegui era appeared to have lift-off when Kudus gave them a surprise lead against Spurs, the winger scoring for a second straight match, but the Hammers' defence began to creak under constant pressure and they could have no complaints when Kulusevski equalised. In the second half, West Ham simply failed to lay a glove on their hosts. Bissouma was granted the freedom of the penalty area to score Spurs' second goal, and the subsequent mix-up between Areola and Todibo summed up the visitors' performance. To add to Lopetegui's frustrations, Spurs' third goal came just as he was readying a triple substitution in a bid to turn the tide. In the end, West Ham were arguably fortunate to limit their hosts to four goals, with Kulusevski, Johnson and Timo Werner all passing up late chances. To make matters worse for West Ham, they will also be without key attacker Kudus for matches against Man Utd, Nottingham Forest and Everton following his late dismissal. Club reports

282,282,bournemouth,2025-03-15,"AFC Bournemouth’s hopes of securing UEFA Champions League qualification were dealt a blow as Brentford came from behind to win 2-1 at the Vitality Stadium. Christian Norgaard completed the turnaround on Saturday, as Bournemouth’s dismal record against Brentford continued. The Cherries have not beaten Brentford in a league match since August 2014, though they took the lead through Vitaly Janelt’s own goal. But Yoane Wissa headed in an equaliser, paving the way for Norgaard to capitalise on some sloppy Bournemouth defending in the second half, after Antoine Semenyo had squandered a golden chance for the hosts. David Brooks missed a similarly glaring opportunity in the 80th minute, with Brentford holding firm to secure a win that moves them to within one point of 10th, and three behind Bournemouth in ninth. How the match unfolded
Bournemouth took the lead in the 17th minute – Milos Kerkez charged into the box on the overlap, with his cross turned in inadvertently by the unfortunate Janelt. Semenyo looked set to put Bournemouth back in front early in the second half, only to head against the crossbar after meeting Justin Kluivert’s inviting right-wing cross. Bournemouth were made to pay for that miss in the 71st minute, as Schade’s long throw found its way through a crowd to Norgaard, who duly finished. Mark Flekken came up big for Brentford, thwarting Brooks from point-blank range before keeping out strikes from Marcus Tavernier and Semenyo as the Bees extended their unbeaten Premier League run against Bournemouth to six matches. Cherries unpicked from set-pieces
Kepa was caught out as Bournemouth let a 2-0 lead slip at Tottenham Hotspur last week, and it did appear as though his confidence had taken a hit as Brentford put him under pressure in the first half. However, it is not just Kepa who struggled for Bournemouth against Brentford’s set-piece proficiency. Bournemouth are now winless in four league matches, having given up leads in the last two encounters. But Andoni Iraola’s team cannot afford such slip-ups defensively, especially from set-pieces if they are to consider themselves contenders for Champions League qualification. Next up for Bournemouth in the Premier League is a home game against Ipswich Town on 2 April. However, he played a crucial role in Brentford’s winner, with his throw causing havoc for Bournemouth’s backline. Club reports

Mark Flekken came up big for Brentford, thwarting Brooks from point-blank range before keeping out strikes from Marcus Tavernier and Semenyo as the Bees extended their unbeaten Premier League run against Bournemouth to six matches. Cherries unpicked from set-pieces
Kepa was caught out as Bournemouth let a 2-0 lead slip at Tottenham Hotspur last week, and it did appear as though his confidence had taken a hit as Brentford put him under pressure in the first half. He should have done better when coming to collect Mbeumo’s corner, yet instead he was poorly positioned, enabling Wissa to rise highest and get there first to turn into a gaping net. Kepa also looked like he would have been struggling to get down to an Mbeumo strike soon after, though Kerkez managed to divert it wide. However, it is not just Kepa who struggled for Bournemouth against Brentford’s set-piece proficiency. They can consider themselves unfortunate not to have gone back in front when Semenyo headed against the woodwork, or to equalise when Brooks poked straight at Flekken. Schade throwing things forward
Schade has cemented his place in Brentford’s attack and is thriving on the left of Thomas Frank’s front three. However, he played a crucial role in Brentford’s winner, with his throw causing havoc for Bournemouth’s backline. Wissa benefited from Schade’s long throw in Brentford’s home draw with Everton last month. Schade’s ability to generate power and dip on his throws has swiftly become another weapon in the Bees’ armoury, and one Frank is not afraid to call upon. If he carries on like this, then Brentford might well have found their very own Rory Delap-style throw-in specialist, in a call back to Stoke City’s famous threat during their first few years in the Premier League. Brentford have now reeled off five straight away league wins for the first time since 2010, when they were in League One. Club reports

Southampton started the better of the two sides and earned an early chance as Yukinari Sugawara scampered down the right before delivering a dangerous ball across the face of goal, but Kamaldeen Sulemana couldn't finish from close range.

Southampton looked for a way back and went close, as Jose Sa saved from Sugawara and Onuachu. Southampton show fight in defeat
Ivan Juric’s men have endured a poor campaign thus far. They also made a decent start here, with Sugawara getting plenty of the ball, causing problems down the right and unfortunate not to pick up an assist as Sulemana failed to bundle home his fine cross. But once again, Southampton paid for poor defending. Southampton return to action with another home match on 2 April against Crystal Palace.

They did find the net eventually after Dibling’s shot struck a post with Onuachu on hand to follow up to provide a grandstand finish but Wolves held on. Poor defending on the transition contributed to Wolves’ second goal after the second half had barely started. Wolves edge closer to safety
A battling 1-1 draw against Everton at home last weekend was a respectable result for Wolves without Matheus Cunha. The beginning of the second half couldn’t have started much better for the visitors, through Strand Larsen’s second goal of the game, with the Norwegian stepping up to fill the void left by the suspended Cunha. They failed to add a third, with Joao Gomes curling a shot inches wide from goal at 2-0.

286,286,wolverhampton,2024-10-20,"John Stones’ last-gasp header earned Manchester City a dramatic 2-1 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers. The reigning champions move on to 20 points, but remain one point behind Liverpool, following the Reds' 2-1 win over Chelsea at Anfield, while Wolves return to the foot of the table following their late heartbreak. City levelled in the 33rd minute when Gvardiol whipped a fierce 20-yard strike into Sa's top-left corner, though the Wolves goalkeeper produced another smart stop to keep out a Savinho shot just before the break. Both sides went close in the early stages of the second half; Sa got down well again to deny Ruben Dias from distance, while Matheus Cunha swept a long-range effort narrowly wide. But in the fifth minute of stoppage time, Wolves’ resolve was broken as Stones buried his header beyond a helpless Sa, with the goal given following a VAR review. Late heartbreak for Wolves
For the first time in 20 years, Wolves had failed to win any of their opening seven matches in a league season and despite Gary O’Neil’s continued faith in his team, the pressure was starting to mount. Therefore, they certainly would have been forgiven for not relishing the prospect of welcoming the reigning Premier League champions to Molineux. But their defensive resilience was the standout feature for much of the game – as City grew into it, and eventually brought themselves level, Wolves continued to make life difficult for Pep Guardiola’s side as they desperately tried to hold onto what would have been a morale-boosting second point of the season. Despite Wolves stubbornly keeping them at bay, City kept probing and Stones, who snatched a last-gasp equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Arsenal, was the right man in the right place once more with his thumping header turning one point into three.

The hosts made an ideal start, striking first after just seven minutes when Nelson Semedo delivered a delicious cross in behind City’s defence for Strand Larsen to tuck away. City levelled in the 33rd minute when Gvardiol whipped a fierce 20-yard strike into Sa's top-left corner, though the Wolves goalkeeper produced another smart stop to keep out a Savinho shot just before the break. City turned up the pressure in search of a winner, with Silva firing into the side-netting before Matheus Nunes saw his effort deflected over the crossbar. But in the fifth minute of stoppage time, Wolves’ resolve was broken as Stones buried his header beyond a helpless Sa, with the goal given following a VAR review. Stones’ goal was initially disallowed on-field due to Silva being in an offside position and in the goalkeeper’s line of vision. But their defensive resilience was the standout feature for much of the game – as City grew into it, and eventually brought themselves level, Wolves continued to make life difficult for Pep Guardiola’s side as they desperately tried to hold onto what would have been a morale-boosting second point of the season. In the end, all of their hard work eventually counted for nothing, with Stones’ last-gasp header a real dagger to their hearts. Comeback kings strike again
Going behind is familiar territory for City so far this season, this was the fourth time that they have conceded the opening goal, but as with the previous three occasions, they fought back to win. So, when Strand Larsen opened the scoring, there certainly would not have been cause for any panic as far as Guardiola was concerned. City gradually found their feet before Gvardiol’s superb strike brought them on level terms and it was only smart saves from Sa which prevented the visitors from completing the turnaround sooner. Despite Wolves stubbornly keeping them at bay, City kept probing and Stones, who snatched a last-gasp equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Arsenal, was the right man in the right place once more with his thumping header turning one point into three.

Declan Rice's pinpoint finish dragged Arsenal level with 16 minutes to play, but it was United who went closest to a winner in the dying stages. While United stay 14th with 34 points, Arsenal are 15 behind Liverpool, who now need just 16 points from their last nine matches to wrap up the title. Leandro Trossard sent a long-range shot wide then was just unable to bring down Martin Odegaard's clever flick in behind, but it was the Belgian's pull on Alejandro Garnacho that led to United taking the lead. Fernandes stepped up to the resulting free-kick 25 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, whipping his effort over the wall and beyond Raya, whose positioning may have been suspect. United had two big chances to open the second half, but Raya brilliantly denied Noussair Mazraoui and Joshua Zirkzee to keep the deficit at one. As United dropped deeper and deeper, Arsenal's leveller finally arrived in the 74th minute, Rice firing off the far post and in after being teed up by Jurrien Timber. Arsenal were unable to build on that moment, however, and only a stunning save from Raya denied Fernandes a 93rd-minute winner, the Spaniard parrying the initial shot before clawing the spinning ball away from the line. United run out of steam
On the back of United's 1-1 Europa League last-16 draw at Real Sociedad on Thursday, Ruben Amorim said the Red Devils' aim for this clash with the Gunners was simply to ""survive"". For over three-quarters of the match, United thrived, but their depleted squad ultimately ran out of gas in the dying stages. United succeeded in limiting Arsenal to long-range efforts throughout the first half, while Fernandes made it two direct free-kick goals in his last three league matches, having also netted from a dead ball at Everton. Everybody at Old Trafford was expecting an Arsenal siege after half-time, but some big chances went begging for the hosts as Raya kept out Mazraoui and Zirkzee. Fernandes squandered another glorious opening at the death, but overall, Amorim will be pleased with how his patched-up side fared. Twenty-two-year-old goalkeeper Dermot Mee – whose last senior outing came for Altrincham in the National League in 2022 – was the oldest player on United's bench, though former Arsenal centre-back Ayden Heaven was solid enough after coming on for his Premier League debut at half-time. United will hope to recover a couple of players for their all-important second leg against Real Sociedad on Thursday, before visiting relegation-threatened Leicester City next Sunday.

Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford having gone two Premier League matches without a goal, amassing a combined three shots on target throughout their 1-0 defeat to West Ham United and their goalless draw with Nottingham Forest. Those two results – combined with three straight victories for Liverpool – had made Arsenal major outsiders in the title race, and though they found their shooting boots when thrashing PSV 7-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday, their attacking woes returned on Sunday. With makeshift striker Merino struggling to find space against United's back five, Arsenal spent long periods probing around the edge of the area without ever truly threatening. Rice teed up a grandstand finish at 1-1, but in truth, that was Arsenal's only clear-cut opening in the second half, and if not for some highlight-reel saves from Raya, the result could have been even worse. With Liverpool looking relentless, a return of two points from three league matches is simply not good enough for Arsenal.

290,290,everton,2024-10-05,"Everton old boy Anthony Gordon saw a penalty saved on his return to Goodison Park as Newcastle United were held to a 0-0 draw. After James Tarkowski's foolish foul on Sandro Tonali gave Gordon, who left Everton for Newcastle in January 2023, his opportunity from 12 yards, he could not find a way past England team-mate Jordan Pickford. The save from Pickford was heartily celebrated by the Everton fans, though their frustration was directed at referee Craig Pawson midway through the second half, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin felt he too should have had a penalty. A point nudges Sean Dyche's side further clear of the relegation zone in 16th, while Newcastle can at least take solace in a place in the top six, leapfrogging Fulham. That decision was given following a VAR review, and referee Pawson was soon called to the pitchside monitor before awarding a penalty after Tarkowski tangled with Tonali. But Pickford won the battle of wits with Gordon from the spot, diving to his left and keeping out a tame effort with his legs. Everton wanted a penalty of their own in the second half as Calvert-Lewin went down under Dan Burn’s challenge when he looked certain to tuck in following Nick Pope’s save. Team-mates save toiling Tarkowski
Calvert-Lewin and Everton thought they should have had the opportunity to take all three points, but outside of that incident, they created precious few clear chances and were perhaps fortunate to come away with a goalless draw. That was perhaps not a result many would have expected given the makeshift nature of the Everton defence. After beating Crystal Palace on Jarrad Branthwaite's return to the team last week, they lost both the centre-back and Vitalii Mykolenko to injury, leaving Tarkowski as the last remaining member of Dyche's first-choice back four, with club captain Seamus Coleman also out. As it was, Tarkowski was grateful for his team-mates for their contributions to the clean sheet as he struggled throughout, most notably when wrestling Tonali to the ground. Pickford saved his captain on that occasion, while Michael Keane stepped across to make a vital challenge on Joelinton soon afterwards. More ruthless opposition might have made Tarkowski – who did make an important block late on from Miguel Almiron – and Everton pay. This was a hard-earned clean sheet but hardly a blueprint moving forward, and Dyche will be wanting Tarkowski especially to cut out the silly mistakes when the Toffees return to action at Ipswich Town later this month.

After James Tarkowski's foolish foul on Sandro Tonali gave Gordon, who left Everton for Newcastle in January 2023, his opportunity from 12 yards, he could not find a way past England team-mate Jordan Pickford.

Gordon should still have had the final say, played in on goal by Miguel Almiron with eight minutes to play, but he blasted off target as Newcastle were forced to settle for a point. Pickford saved his captain on that occasion, while Michael Keane stepped across to make a vital challenge on Joelinton soon afterwards. Gordon's nightmare Goodison return
Gordon missed Newcastle's last meeting with Everton at St James' Park through suspension, but he was the centre of attention right from the outset on this occasion. Even before the penalty, Gordon was jeered by the crowd and targeted by heavy challenges from his former team-mates, yet a number of bright early touches hinted at a promising performance. The England man's confidence was perhaps rocked by his failure from 12 yards, though, bowing to the huge pressure in that moment, with Ashley Young among those looking to get inside Gordon's head. He was unselfish either side of half-time in looking to tee up Joelinton and then leaving the ball for Guimaraes, before racing through late on and missing the target altogether. In the absence of Alexander Isak and Callum Wilson, Gordon could not step up in a striking role this time, with Newcastle ultimately just missing the final touch despite controlling much of the game. Matters could well look brighter in the striker department for Eddie Howe after the international break – the Newcastle boss will be hoping to have both Isak, who is not going away with Sweden, and Wilson fit and available for the Magpies’ clash with Brighton on 19 October.

292,292,liverpool,2024-10-20,"Liverpool returned to the top of the Premier League table as Curtis Jones hit the winner in an entertaining 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Anfield. Having been knocked off the summit by Manchester City's last-gasp victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers earlier on Sunday, Liverpool responded by passing arguably their sternest test yet under Arne Slot. Mohamed Salah's first-half penalty opened the scoring after Levi Colwill felled Jones, though Chelsea levelled shortly after the interval through a composed Nicolas Jackson finish. However, it was the impressive duo of Salah and Jones that combined for the decisive goal soon afterwards, the latter scoring on the stretch in front of the Kop. The victory restores Liverpool's one-point lead over City, while they are four clear of their next opponents Arsenal. How the match unfolded 
After surviving an earlier penalty appeal for a challenge on Salah, Colwill clumsily tripped Jones inside the area, allowing the Egyptian to power home from the spot on 29 minutes. Salah was caught offside when crossing for Cody Gakpo to tap home soon afterwards as the match opened up, with Jackson and Dominik Szoboszlai going close at either end. Jackson was initially ruled offside when slotting home from Moises Caicedo's through-ball, but that decision was overturned as replays showed Ibrahima Konate played him onside. That parity lasted just three minutes, though, as Salah's inswinging cross found Jones at the far post, the midfielder taking a wonderful first touch before prodding past Sanchez. Substitutes Renato Veiga and Christopher Nkunku both had half-chances late on, but it was substitute Luis Diaz who went closest to scoring a fourth goal as Liverpool took the spoils. Slot passes major test
Last month's home defeat to Nottingham Forest remains the only blot on Slot's Liverpool record since taking over from Jurgen Klopp and Sunday's victory felt like a particularly important one. AFC Bournemouth – currently 10th after Saturday's upset of Arsenal – were the highest-ranked team in the Premier League table to have been beaten by the Reds ahead of Chelsea's visit, with three of the four teams still hunting a victory – Ipswich Town, Crystal Palace and Wolves – among Liverpool's early-season opponents. If Liverpool are to challenge for the Premier League crown, they will have to prove they can do it against the division's best, with Arsenal, Aston Villa and Man City among their next five opponents. Indeed, the way in which Salah, Gakpo and Darwin Nunez – a first-half replacement for the injured Diogo Jota – harried Chelsea's defence to force errors in a frantic start to the second half was reminiscent of Klopp's ""heavy metal football"". If Slot can mastermind similar performances against the rest of their direct rivals, fans will continue to leave Anfield happy. Captain Reece James returned from a lengthy spell out with a hamstring injury to play 53 minutes, looking lively as he went head-to-head with the man he will hope to challenge for an England starting spot, in Trent Alexander-Arnold. The midfield duo of Romeo Lavia and Caicedo – both of whom were coveted by Liverpool before moving to Stamford Bridge – also showed promise, with the former looking comfortable on his first start since the opening weekend and the latter sliding a fine pass through for Jackson's goal. In the end, it was Chelsea's former player Salah, who now has five Premier League goals against them, who made the difference by scoring the first and creating the winner. Club reports

Given the churn in their squad over the last two years, Chelsea's rebuilding process is expected to take time, and green shoots of recovery have been visible throughout a goal-laden start to Maresca's reign.

But in the 82nd minute, Kepa brought down Son inside the area, and the Spurs captain stepped up to convert straight down the middle and seal a share of the spoils. Spurs, meanwhile, stay 13th ahead of Manchester United's later match against Arsenal. How the match unfolded
Spurs almost endured a nightmare start when Cristian Romero’s slack pass was picked off by Evanilson, but the returning defender’s blushes were spared by a strong Guglielmo Vicario save. However, Bournemouth did take advantage of their opponents’ sloppy play in the 42nd minute, catching Spurs on the break as Kerkez’s excellent run and cross from the left was finished by the sliding Tavernier. After seeing a Justin Kluivert strike ruled out for offside following a VAR check, the Cherries doubled their lead in the 65th minute, the Dutch creator slipping in Evanilson, who dinked the ball over Vicario. Spurs, though, gave themselves a lifeline two minutes later when Sarr’s attempted cross looped over Kepa, and that would not be the Bournemouth goalkeeper's last involvement. Kepa rushed out to try and claim a throughball but instead clipped the feet of Son, with the Spurs captain dusting himself down to equalise from 12 yards. Spurs' super subs salvage a point
Spurs have endured a difficult time with injuries lately, but with many players returning, Ange Postecoglou now has the ability to affect the game from the bench. Postecoglou’s side also looked unassured in possession, with several loose passes picked off by Bournemouth.

Indeed, it was Pedro Porro’s giveaway that led to Bournemouth flying forward for the opener, with the Spurs players leaving the field to boos from their supporters at half-time. But the introductions of Lucas Bergvall and Son injected some dynamism into the team, and both players clipped the upright before Sarr’s fortuitous strike gave Spurs hope.

Talk of Bournemouth gatecrashing the European picture gathered pace as they made a strong start to 2025, but their momentum has faltered somewhat, having now gone three Premier League matches without a win. Having seen three chances come and go in the opening five minutes, Bournemouth stamped their authority on this contest and looked fitter and sharper than their under-pressure hosts.

Michail Antonio got the hosts off to a flyer at London Stadium on Saturday with a goal after only 48 seconds, but Liam Delap provided a rapid response just five minutes later to level the contest. West Ham, however, regained composure and made their dominance pay when Mohammed Kudus restored the lead just before half-time. Captain Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paqueta added to the scoreline after the break as the hosts ultimately claimed a comprehensive triumph to end a poor run of form that had seen them fail to register a win across September. A convincing defeat for Kieran McKenna’s Ipswich means they remain winless and hover just one point above the bottom three in 17th position, while West Ham rise to 12th in the early league table. How the match unfolded
West Ham got off to the perfect start when Bowen was set free down the right by Tomas Soucek and the England international surged into the penalty area before squaring to Antonio, who side-footed home from the centre of the box. After chasing down West Ham’s clearance from a corner, he unleashed a low, stinging shot inside the near post. Soucek had a shot blocked from close range before Kudus met Antonio’s curling cross from the right at the back post, but the Ghanaian’s header hit the post before being cleared. Having come so close previously, Kudus’ header found the net this time, as he nodded in a rebound after Antonio’s own aerial attempt had powered off the crossbar. West Ham had their third inside four minutes of the restart as Bowen cut in from the right to threaten. Ipswich nearly found a route back into the game in the 65th minute when Wes Burns’ cross found Delap in the box, but Alphonse Areola did superbly to save his low header. Bowen once more found space down the right and he crossed for Paqueta to tap into an empty net from close range. Bowen at his brilliant best
From his assist in the opening minute, Bowen proved a constant thorn in the side of the Ipswich defence. Bowen’s goal in the 49th minute seemed only a matter of time and exemplified his attacking threat. The forward came alive on the right of the box under pressure from former West Ham man Kalvin Phillips before cutting inside with a burst of pace to fire in an impressive low finish. A goal and an assist that could have been more earned him a deserved player of the match award and West Ham will hope for more of the same from their skipper after the international break. Leaky defence leads to visitors' downfall
The writing looked like it was on the wall for McKenna’s men after just 48 seconds, with West Ham’s forward line immediately breaking through their shaky defence. Too often, West Ham were able to make entries into the Ipswich box, with the promoted side frequently relying on last-ditch blocks and close-range saves to prevent the scoreline from becoming an embarrassing one. The woodwork also proved Ipswich’s saviour in the 38th minute when Kudus directed his header onto the post when it appeared easier to score. They faced a West Ham attack that has not exactly dazzled so far this season, with the Hammers almost doubling their starting goal tally of six during the fixture. West Ham did click upfront, but Ipswich did little to curb their attacking flow once they had found their rhythm and paid the price with a resounding defeat that makes their first match after the international break against Everton even more important.

297,297,ipswich-town,2024-10-05,"West Ham United overcame a frantic start to secure a much-needed first home win of the Premier League season against Ipswich Town as a free-flowing performance gave them a 4-1 victory. A convincing defeat for Kieran McKenna’s Ipswich means they remain winless and hover just one point above the bottom three in 17th position, while West Ham rise to 12th in the early league table. But Delap provided the perfect response for Ipswich.

From his assist in the opening minute, Bowen proved a constant thorn in the side of the Ipswich defence.

298,298,everton,2024-11-23,"Ten-man Brentford held Everton to a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park for their first away point in the Premier League this season. A red card to Christian Norgaard meant the visitors played the whole duration of the second half with a numerical disadvantage, but they kept Everton in check for a well-deserved point. Mark Flekken was on top form to twice deny Dominic Calvert-Lewin before the break, although Yoane Wissa squandered a great chance for Brentford prior to Norgaard’s dismissal for a challenge on Jordan Pickford. Yet Sean Dyche’s team, who have struggled for goals all season, failed to make their advantage count after the break, with a long-range strike from Idrissa Gueye and a handful of opportunities for substitute Beto the closest they came to breaking the deadlock. Everton sit 15th with 11 points, while Brentford moved, at least temporarily, into 10th. How the match unfolded
Brentford goalkeeper Flekken started as he meant to go on with a brilliant save from Calvert-Lewin’s inventive backheel four minutes in. Flekken was equally as alert to frustrate Calvert-Lewin again 22 minutes later, while Pickford made a vital save to deny Wissa at the other end, and the Everton goalkeeper was in the thick of it when Brentford went down to 10 men. Norgaard lunged in on Pickford with a studs-up challenge inside the six-yard box, and referee Chris Kavanagh chose to send the Dane off after consulting with the VAR. Flekken kept the game level by tipping over Gueye’s long-range effort early in the second half while Pickford was also forced into a save by Keane Lewis-Potter as Brentford showed their counter-attacking threat. Beto came off the bench and proved an aerial threat for Everton, with a shot blocked in front of goal by Ethan Pinnock in stoppage time, but a largely frustrated Goodison Park crowd were forced to see their team settle for a point. Bees draw Everton’s sting
Brentford have collected 16 of the available 18 points at home this season, but it is their away form that has let Thomas Frank’s side down. Having lost all five of their Premier League away games, a visit to struggling Everton was a perfect opportunity for the Bees to break the duck. Blunt Everton squander golden chance 
An unbeaten run in October had pulled Everton away from the relegation zone, but it is now just two wins in 12 matches this season and Dyche’s team are looking over their shoulder, despite a run of just one defeat in eight, with this their second successive 0-0 draw. A sharp first-half display from his players would have given Dyche hope heading into the second half a man up, but the Toffees could not unlock a well-drilled Brentford side after the break, and often looked too predictable in their approach. With fixtures against Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City to come in December, Everton could rue not capitalising on today’s numerical advantage at home, and Dyche quickly needs to solve their attacking issues.

Having lost all five of their Premier League away games, a visit to struggling Everton was a perfect opportunity for the Bees to break the duck. But after letting the hosts take the upper hand early on, Frank’s job was not made any easier by the sending-off of Norgaard, which left Brentford to play with a numerical disadvantage for almost an hour. Yet they were well organised in the second half, with Nathan Collins and Pinnock excellent, while they offered some bite on the counter, albeit Lewis-Potter could not find the finish in multiple half-chances. Frank also gave record-signing Igor Thiago his Premier League debut as a substitute. Though it was not the win that they came looking for, a spirited display that ended in a first point on the road is something that Brentford can build on. A sharp first-half display from his players would have given Dyche hope heading into the second half a man up, but the Toffees could not unlock a well-drilled Brentford side after the break, and often looked too predictable in their approach. Substitute Beto was their biggest threat as he headed straight into the gloves of Flekken five minutes after his introduction before firing another header over not much later, while he was also denied by Pinnock in added time.

The Seagulls scored early in both halves, with goals from Joao Pedro and Kaoru Mitoma sealing the points at the Vitality Stadium. Brighton move up to fifth place on 22 points – level with Chelsea and Arsenal, who they trail on goal difference – while the Cherries drop a place to 13th and remain on 15 points. Bournemouth pushed for an equaliser, and Evanilson had the ball in the net on 41 minutes, but his joy was cut short as the offside flag went up against Kluivert in the build-up, with VAR confirming the onfield decision. Bournemouth pulled a goal back in stoppage time through substitute Brooks’ neat finish, while Antoine Semenyo's volley rattled the crossbar with the final kick of the game, as Brighton hung on. Cherries picked off as home streak halted
Bournemouth were aiming to win four successive Premier League home games for the first time in their history, having impressively beaten the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City on their run thus far. The Cherries were undone by their opponents’ first meaningful attack, with Joao Pedro in the right place to clinically finish after Kepa spilled Rutter’s strike straight to him. Andoni Iraola’s side responded well and could have been on level terms at the break if not for poor finishing by Semenyo and Kluivert and smart saves by Verbruggen. Bournemouth struggled to capitalise on their numerical advantage after Baleba’s red card but did eventually break down the stubborn Brighton defence via Brooks in the 93rd minute. Buoyant Brighton just about build on momentum
Brighton travelled to the Vitality Stadium fresh from their impressive turnaround against reigning Premier League champions Man City before the international break. Their neat spells of possession soon unlocked the Bournemouth defence, and Hurzeler would have felt confident when the first chance fell to the in-form Joao Pedro.

The Seagulls scored early in both halves, with goals from Joao Pedro and Kaoru Mitoma sealing the points at the Vitality Stadium. Just four minutes had elapsed when Joao Pedro put Fabian Hurzeler’s side in front, while the Brazilian turned provider for Mitoma in the 49th minute. Brighton move up to fifth place on 22 points – level with Chelsea and Arsenal, who they trail on goal difference – while the Cherries drop a place to 13th and remain on 15 points. The visitors started quickly, and Kepa Arrizabalaga could only parry Georginio Rutter’s fierce drive straight to Joao Pedro, who tucked away the rebound from close range. The visitors then doubled the lead within four minutes of the restart – Mitoma latched onto Joao Pedro’s delightful throughball to slot past Kepa, with the goal confirmed following a VAR review. Bournemouth pulled a goal back in stoppage time through substitute Brooks’ neat finish, while Antoine Semenyo's volley rattled the crossbar with the final kick of the game, as Brighton hung on. However, Brighton clearly took some encouragement from the fact they have only registered one clean sheet this season and exploited that. The Cherries were undone by their opponents’ first meaningful attack, with Joao Pedro in the right place to clinically finish after Kepa spilled Rutter’s strike straight to him.

Their neat spells of possession soon unlocked the Bournemouth defence, and Hurzeler would have felt confident when the first chance fell to the in-form Joao Pedro. The Brazilian was not done there though, as he threaded the eye of a needle with his precise pass to release Mitoma for the second goal – notching up an eighth direct goal involvement in his last nine Premier League appearances. Despite their two-goal lead, the Seagulls had to increase their concentration levels when Baleba was sent for an early bath just before the hour mark.

302,302,manchester-city,2024-10-05,"Mateo Kovacic's first Premier League double earned Manchester City a comeback win as they beat Fulham 3-2 at the Etihad Stadium to maintain the pressure on leaders Liverpool. The former Chelsea midfielder struck either side of half-time, with Jeremy Doku also on target, to give Pep Guardiola's side their first win in three matches in the Premier League and move to one point behind Liverpool, who beat Crystal Palace earlier on Saturday. City fell behind midway through the first half when Andreas Pereira volleyed in from close range, but Fulham passed up further chances to add to their lead. Kovacic's goals and a clinching third from Doku ultimately made the visitors pay for their wastefulness, although substitute Rodrigo Muniz set up a nervy finish for the champions when he scored with two minutes to play. City held on to stay second and move on to 17 points while Fulham remain sixth on 11 points ahead of seventh-placed Newcastle United, who play against Everton later in the day. How the match unfolded
Fulham gave Man City an early warning as Adama Traore was denied by Ederson following a swift counter, and the visitors broke the deadlock after 26 minutes when Raul Jimenez's clever backheel flick into the six-yard box was volleyed in by Pereira. Traore squandered a great opportunity to double Fulham's lead when he fired over from close range, and City took advantage of their reprieve to level in the 32nd minute when a corner broke kindly for Kovacic, whose strike deflected in via Joachim Andersen. City grabbed what proved to be the vital third goal with eight minutes remaining as Doku cut inside from the left before rifling beyond Leno from the edge of the box, even if Muniz's subsequent deflected effort ensured a tense conclusion. City return to winning ways
After back-to-back draws, City knew further dropped points here would allow Liverpool breathing space at the Premier League summit, with the Reds having briefly established a four-point cushion with a 1-0 win at Palace. And City's 49-match unbeaten home run in all competitions appeared under threat when Pereira broke the deadlock following a neatly worked Fulham move. Kovacic was the unlikely City hero as he took his goal tally for the season to three, already his best return in a single Premier League campaign. While the margin of victory was not quite so comfortable in the end, Guardiola and his side can at least head into the international break hot on Liverpool's tails in the title race. Wasteful Fulham made to pay
Although they gave a hugely positive account of themselves, Fulham will definitely depart the Etihad with a sense of what might have been. Indeed, but for profligate finishing, the Cottagers could have moved level on points with City after a superb run of form lifted them into the top half of the Premier League table. Club reports

Even with those setbacks, Marco Silva's side stayed in the match with the late goal from Muniz, but they did not quite have enough to rescue a point and fell to their first defeat since losing at Manchester United on the opening day.

Forest remain third, now on 51 points, moving four above Man City, who could drop out of the top four if Chelsea avoid defeat against Leicester City on Sunday. How the match unfolded
City started the game brightly, with Erling Haaland gifted an early chance as he picked Chris Wood’s pocket just outside the box, only to drag his low shot through Murillo’s legs and wide of the far post. Forest stay on course for top-four finish
Man City were in a slump the last time these sides met in the Premier League in early December, but they nonetheless earned a 3-0 win over Forest at the Etihad Stadium. However, Forest showed their mettle in this meeting, extending their advantage over the Citizens in the race for Champions League qualification. Nicolas Dominguez met Anthony Elanga’s clipped cross on the stretch, but his volley was held by Ederson
Hudson-Odoi worked the wide spaces well and finally got his reward on 83 minutes, with Josko Gvardiol leaving it too late to close him down. Forest now have a five-point cushion over fifth-placed Chelsea and will hope to build on this momentum against relegation-threatened Ipswich Town next time out. Man City stumble again
City’s troubles this season have been well documented, but Pep Guardiola would have been keen to gain a stronger foothold in the top four with a win over Forest. Even when Morgan Gibbs-White presented Mateo Kovacic with the chance for a last-minute equaliser with a skewed clearance, the Croat’s shot curled just wide of Sels’s far post. Club reports

In the dying seconds, Enes Unal had the chance to snatch a draw, but he ballooned a shot over from close range as Leicester held on for a precious three points. Buonanotte proves his worth
It has been a tough return to the top flight for Leicester. The Argentinian on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion proved he could be Leicester's biggest weapon as they look to avoid an immediate return to the Championship. The 19-year-old’s second goal of the season gave the Foxes a crucial win, causing chaos with his surging runs down the right, and was influential in the No 10 role throughout. His defence-splitting pass sent Vardy through later in the first half, only for the veteran striker to squander it, and he continued to provide the Foxes with an outlet even as Bournemouth upped their pressure in the latter stages. Bournemouth fail to mount another comeback
The Cherries made a bright start – Senesi went close with a header in the sixth minute – but their weaknesses were laid bare shortly after as Leicester looked dangerous every time they broke forward. A recovery of the same sort failed to materialise in Leicester. Club reports

307,307,bournemouth,2024-10-05,"Leicester City got their first win of the Premier League season, defeating AFC Bournemouth 1-0 at the King Power Stadium. Bournemouth put on a much better display in the second half though, with Lewis Cook having a direct free-kick ruled out for offside 66 minutes in. Illia Zabarnyi and Dango Ouattara also hit the woodwork as the Cherries continued to dominate, but they fell short of finding an equaliser. The Foxes move up to 15th, with six points from seven matches, while Bournemouth sit 13th - two points better off their opponents. Stephy Mavididi’s penalty shout for a handball against Zabarnyi was turned down shortly before Jamie Vardy fired a gilt-edged chance wide after getting in behind the Bournemouth backline. Zabarnyi hit the woodwork from a Cook free-kick four minutes after the restart and Ryan Christie tested Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen from the edge of the box as Bournemouth pushed.

His defence-splitting pass sent Vardy through later in the first half, only for the veteran striker to squander it, and he continued to provide the Foxes with an outlet even as Bournemouth upped their pressure in the latter stages. Bournemouth fail to mount another comeback
The Cherries made a bright start – Senesi went close with a header in the sixth minute – but their weaknesses were laid bare shortly after as Leicester looked dangerous every time they broke forward. Despite going behind, Bournemouth offered little going forward, with an Antoine Semenyo shot blocked at close range by Wout Faes the closest to an equaliser in the first half. Andoni Iraola looked to the bench at the break, introducing Ouattara in place of Justin Kluivert and the Cherries responded positively, only for the substitute and Zabarnyi to be denied by the goal frame. But a comeback was not against the odds, as Bournemouth had come from two goals down to beat Everton in the dying minutes earlier this season, so they kept on probing. Iraola would have seen this as a good chance for the team to come away with three points, and with games against Arsenal, Aston Villa and champions Manchester City coming up. Club reports

308,308,aston-villa,2024-11-23,"Ross Barkley’s late headed equaliser helped Aston Villa earn a 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace at Villa Park, although their winless run now stands at six matches in all competitions. Unai Emery’s side could not shake their poor form as they were forced to come from behind twice at home to an injury-hit Palace team. Ismaila Sarr got the visitors off to a flying start with his first goal for the club on four minutes, as he slotted home on the break, though Ollie Watkins brought the hosts level in the 36th minute. Villa could have gone ahead just before half-time but Dean Henderson brilliantly saved Youri Tielemans' penalty and Palace capitalised on this 60 seconds later, as Justin Devenny put the visitors back in front in first-half stoppage time. Aston Villa go seventh in the table, while Crystal Palace drop below Wolves and into the relegation zone in 18th. But Villa eventually found the equaliser in the 36th minute as John McGinn clipped a ball through the centre to Watkins on the edge of the box. The hosts came closer still on the stroke of half-time as Villa were awarded a penalty by the referee, following a VAR review after Will Hughes stepped on Bailey’s ankle in the box. But Henderson saved Tielemans’ spot kick low to his right. Watkins ramped up the intensity for Villa, forcing a last-ditch block from Trevoh Chalobah with a stinging shot in the 75th minute. But two minutes later, the hosts were rewarded as Barkley rose highest to flick Tielemans' corner in from the centre of the box. Jeffrey Schlupp nearly had the visitors back in front with a low shot from the edge of the area on 80 minutes, but Emiliano Martinez got a glancing touch to turn it onto the far post. Emery’s men can’t shake poor form
The hosts would have expected to win at Villa Park against relegation-threatened Palace, facing the absences of key players Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze. Yet Emery's men had setbacks from the outset, conceding after just four minutes. It was an issue Villa struggled to resolve as Palace were the more threatening team early on, with the hosts often exposed at the back. While the work rate of Watkins brought Villa back into the match with a goal in the 31st minute, they missed opportunities to take authority of the game. Tielemans missed the penalty to go ahead with a strike that was a comfortable height for Henderson to save before Palace raced down the other end to lead once more. It took a brilliant corner from the left - Tielemans’ redemption - to find Barkley in the box, who headed the shot onto the far post to claw back a point. But Villa are still looking to end their winless run and their poor form continues. After a fine ball from Mateta that set him on his way, the winger showed great strength and composure to hold off a Villa defender to work space for himself in the box before firing low past Martinez. Twice more he worked his way in behind the Villa defence in the first half, receiving from Hughes in an overload to the right of the box before surging free from the halfway line to set up Mateta, though he was offside. Villa would have done well to pay attention to those early warning signs as Sarr was instrumental in Palace’s second goal, charging forward from back to front before cutting across for Devenny to finish. He demonstrated his persistent threat further after the break, starting a familiar run on that flank from inside his own half before drawing a free-kick just outside the Villa box following a rash challenge from Ian Maatsen.

The visitors opened the scoring in the fourth minute as Jean-Philippe Mateta picked up the ball on the halfway line before threading the ball through to Sarr, who surged into the box to fire home. Instead, it was Palace who went in ahead at the break as Sarr broke down the right from the Palace box before squaring to Devenny at the other end, who netted at the far post.

But Brighton responded brilliantly within six minutes as Jan Paul van Hecke’s powerful header brought the Seagulls level. Kaoru Mitoma and Simon Adingra both had second-half goals disallowed for offside, and it looked like Brighton’s search for a winner would be in vain, but Joao Pedro’s spot-kick in the eighth minute of stoppage time earned a crucial three points. It remains incredibly congested in the top half of the table as Brighton move up to sixth, level on points with Chelsea. Fulham’s excitement was short-lived as Brighton hit back quickly. Mitoma thought he had restored Brighton’s lead in the 55th minute, tapping Yankuba Minteh’s low cross into an empty net, but the offside flag was up, with the on-field decision standing following a VAR review. It did not prove costly though, as Brighton were awarded a stoppage-time penalty after Harrison Reed clipped Joao Pedro in the box, and the Brazilian calmly converted. Brighton steal a late victory
Since their bruising 7-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest at the start of February, Brighton have barely put a foot wrong. The Seagulls have soared back into form with six wins from six in all competitions, including four on the trot in the Premier League. On Saturday, the Seagulls showed their value with a bright start but saw their wings clipped as Jimenez found the opener against the run of play. They struggled to create chances of note outside of the disallowed goals, but their efforts finally bore fruit in the dying minutes as Joao Pedro’s penalty stole the win with the last kick of the game. Brighton could again come up against Fulham in the FA Cup down the line should both sides progress, but they now turn their attention to a tough tie away to Manchester City next weekend. Club reports

Raul Jimenez broke the deadlock for Fulham just past the half-hour mark as he fired home from close range after bringing down a lovely Alex Iwobi cross. Fulham stay in ninth, one point behind AFC Bournemouth. Iwobi’s surge opened space for a pinpoint cross to the far post for Jimenez, who cushioned it off his chest before sliding a shot past Bart Verbruggen from close range. Fulham’s excitement was short-lived as Brighton hit back quickly. Yasin Ayari’s floated cross from a set-piece found an unmarked Van Hecke, who carefully guided his header out of Bernd Leno’s reach and in off the far post. Adingra thought the same 87 minutes in, controlling Adam Webster’s long ball to bend it past Leno, but again the flag went up. The European dream remains well and truly alive for Fabian Hurzeler’s side, their hopes reignited after a demoralising stumble following a strong start to the year. Brighton could again come up against Fulham in the FA Cup down the line should both sides progress, but they now turn their attention to a tough tie away to Manchester City next weekend. Jimenez heroics not enough
Fulham’s confidence was given a timely lift by their dramatic penalty shootout win over Manchester United in the FA Cup last weekend. Marco Silva’s side remain in the hunt for European football, though a crowded table has made the task all the more difficult. And although their push for Europe has hit a slight snag with this result, Jimenez was once again something of a talisman for the Cottagers as he continued his outstanding run. All 10 of the Mexican international’s Premier League goals this season have been significant, either putting Fulham ahead or drawing them level in the match. Fulham continue to pose a significant threat on the road, which will undoubtedly come in handy with a key tie at Arsenal on the horizon. For now, Silva’s side return to Craven Cottage, where they host Tottenham Hotspur next weekend. Club reports

312,312,liverpool,2025-03-08,"Liverpool extended their lead at the top of the Premier League table to 16 points as Mohamed Salah scored two penalties in a comeback 3-1 win over Southampton. With Arne Slot watching from the stands as he serves his touchline ban, Southampton threatened an upset when Will Smallbone took advantage of a mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson to open the scoring just before half-time. But Liverpool were a team transformed after half-time. Darwin Nunez equalised in the 51st minute then won a penalty that was converted by Salah three minutes later. While Southampton stay bottom on nine points, Liverpool hold a huge advantage over second-placed Arsenal, who face Manchester United and Chelsea in their two games in hand in the next eight days. How the match unfolded
Curtis Jones slammed a powerful effort wide six minutes in, but chances were few and far between for Liverpool in a subdued start. Some excellent footwork from Ryan Gravenberch led to Trent Alexander-Arnold having a shot smothered by Aaron Ramsdale, while Nunez sent an acrobatic effort over. But that was the sum of Liverpool's first-half efforts, and they fell behind in stoppage time as Smallbone took advantage of some hesitant defending to tuck home. Nunez got across his man to tap Luis Diaz's low centre home, then was fouled in the area by Smallbone, allowing Salah to find the top-left corner from 12 yards. Alisson had to remain alert to deny Cameron Archer on the break, but the contest was over when Sugawara was penalised by the referee for a handball following a late VAR review, as Salah scored into the opposite corner. Liverpool overcome slow start
Amid the ecstasy that followed Liverpool's smash-and-grab Champions League victory over Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, Slot sought to keep his players grounded. ""I have to convince my players that we will play three finals"", Slot said, putting this match on the same level as Tuesday's return leg against Paris Saint-Germain and next week's EFL Cup final against Newcastle United. But the leaders came out sluggishly and allowed Southampton to build confidence, and when Van Dijk dawdled on the ball in his own goalmouth, allowing Smallbone in to score, it did seem as though complacency may have played a part. Slot looked to change things with the half-time introductions of Andy Robertson, Alexis Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott, and it was something of a surprise to see Nunez stay on, after his kick at Walker-Peters was checked for a possible red card and cleared by the VAR. He tapped home after Diaz sped to the byline to cross, then got to a loose ball marginally ahead of Smallbone, who cut him down to grant Salah his first penalty of the game. Having added another from 12 yards late on, Salah now has a combined 44 goal involvements in the Premier League this season, making it his outright best campaign in the competition after he had 42 contributions in 2017/18. It may not have been a vintage Liverpool performance, but just as they did at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday, they got the job done, taking another big step towards the title. Smallbone – one of five players to keep his place in the lineup – was tenacious in midfield throughout the first half, and he showed great awareness to pick Van Dijk's pocket and squeeze his shot home for the opener in stoppage time. But it was Smallbone's challenge from behind on Nunez that led to Liverpool taking the lead, with that error coming at a vital time when Southampton needed to keep things tight. Club reports

But the leaders came out sluggishly and allowed Southampton to build confidence, and when Van Dijk dawdled on the ball in his own goalmouth, allowing Smallbone in to score, it did seem as though complacency may have played a part. Smallbone goes from hero to villain
Ivan Juric has not been under any illusions regarding Southampton's predicament, admitting the coming weeks are about preparing for next season. But the Saints boss admitted this week that he ""expected much more"" from his players, and he made six changes to the team that suffered a meek 4-0 defeat at Chelsea last time out. Returning captain Jan Bednarek lasted just 17 minutes before a nasty clash of heads with team-mate Ryan Manning led to him being replaced by Armel Bella-Kotchap, but Southampton moved on from that early setback impressively. But it was Smallbone's challenge from behind on Nunez that led to Liverpool taking the lead, with that error coming at a vital time when Southampton needed to keep things tight. While there are certainly positives for Juric to take ahead of back-to-back home games against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Crystal Palace, the contest ended with a familiar sinking feeling for Southampton, who ran out of steam in the second half.

314,314,arsenal,2024-11-23,"The Gunners thought they had taken the lead when Jurrien Timber turned home early on, but the goal was ruled out for offside, a decision which was then confirmed by VAR, with Mikel Merino ahead of play. But Arsenal did go ahead in the 15th minute when Martin Odegaard’s neat flick was gathered by Saka, who drove across the box before rifling the ball into the right-hand corner. Matz Sels was called into action twice in quick succession to close out the half, first producing a strong save to deny Leandro Trossard before diving low to tip Saka’s curled effort behind. Arsenal’s sustained pressure told seven minutes after half-time. Saka was involved again, picking out Partey on the edge of the area. The icing on the cake came form 17-year-old substitute Nwaneri, who produced an assured finish at the near post to become Arsenal’s second-youngest scorer in the Premier League. Gunners back in business
Many may have been surprised to see both Declan Rice and Kai Havertz start the match on the bench, though Arteta’s risk with his team selection on his milestone game ultimately paid off. Arsenal opted to play the ball long into Havertz in recent weeks, but with Gabriel Jesus leading a fluid front line, the Gunners were back to the slick passing football the Premier League has become accustomed to during Arteta’s tenure. Arsenal’s right-hand side proved to be a particular avenue of focus, with a combination of Odegaard, Timber and Jesus almost combining for a wonderful second with a swift passage of play shortly after Saka had thumped the hosts in front. Arsenal were able to control proceedings following Partey’s sensational strike, but were also able to showcase the plethora of attacking options from the bench, none more so than Nwaneri, whose first involvement saw him brilliantly skip beyond Murillo before sending a strike narrowly wide. Nwaneri would get himself on the scoresheet, however, and his dazzling cameo will have Arteta pondering about his involvement from the start in the coming weeks, with the hectic festive period fast approaching. Forest falter
Ahead of kick-off, Nuno Espirito Santo believed that Forest could compete with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium after their flying start to the campaign, but his side were comfortably second-best on a difficult afternoon in north London. And without in-form Chris Wood at the centre of Forest’s attack, Gabriel and William Saliba were rarely troubled by Taiwo Awoniyi. Though the visitors were able to momentarily withstand Arsenal’s onslaught midway through the opening period, their possession failed to amount any opportunities of note, with Forest entering the break without testing David Raya.

Ahead of kick-off, Nuno Espirito Santo believed that Forest could compete with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium after their flying start to the campaign, but his side were comfortably second-best on a difficult afternoon in north London. And without in-form Chris Wood at the centre of Forest’s attack, Gabriel and William Saliba were rarely troubled by Taiwo Awoniyi. Though the visitors were able to momentarily withstand Arsenal’s onslaught midway through the opening period, their possession failed to amount any opportunities of note, with Forest entering the break without testing David Raya. Matters were made worse when Anthony Elanga was forced to withdraw at the interval after falling awkwardly in the first half, though his replacement, Jota Silva, almost reduced the deficit in the 71st minute with a strike that deflected wide off of fellow substitute Wood, before the winger had a goal disallowed in stoppage time. Forest’s unbeaten away record this term came to a tepid end, though will be relying on home comforts in order to return to winning ways when they return to the City Ground to face Ipswich Town next Saturday.

316,316,brentford,2024-10-05,"Brentford beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 5-3 in a thrilling encounter, with six goals being scored in the first half, as Thomas Frank's side ended a three-match winless run to move into the Premier League's top half. Collins won a penalty that was converted by Bryan Mbeumo, before Jorgen Strand Larsen hit another equaliser for the visitors. Some poor Wolves defending allowed Christian Norgaard to re-establish the hosts’ lead and Ethan Pinnock's header put Brentford further ahead just before half-time. Despite a string of second-half saves by Sam Johnstone, the Bees grabbed a fifth through Fabio Carvalho. Rayan Ait-Nouri pulled one back for Wolves at the death, but they stay bottom with just one point, while Brentford go ninth in the table with 10. How the match unfolded
Brentford, who had scored in the first minute of their previous three Premier League matches, needed just 75 seconds to hit the front as Collins headed in from Mikkel Damsgaard's cross. Brentford inched back into the lead after Collins was hauled over by Mario Lemina at a corner, allowing Mbeumo to convert from the penalty spot, but again Wolves responded as Larsen flicked Ait-Nouri's cross home. Yet less than 90 seconds later, Brentford were back ahead – Norgaard drilling into the bottom-left corner. Pinnock subsequently nodded another Damsgaard cross past Johnstone just before half-time. Johnstone was heavily involved in the second half as Brentford went in search of more goals, standing firm to deny Vitaly Janelt then making a fine one-on-one stop from Kevin Schade. But the scoring wasn't over as Ait-Nouri fired through Mark Flekken’s legs at the other end for a stoppage-time consolation. Brentford fired set-piece after set-piece into the Wolves area, and the visiting backline – deprived of centre-back Yerson Mosquera after an anterior cruciate ligament injury – was simply unable to cope. Within 90 seconds of drawing level at 2-2 midway through the first half, they granted Norgaard the freedom of their area to drill home the Bees' third. Bruising Bees make light of injury woes
Brentford have endured some rotten luck on the injury front so far this season, with Yoane Wissa and Mathias Jensen joining Igor Thiago, Josh Dasilva, Rico Henry and Aaron Hickey in the treatment room. Yet Frank's side have still found a way to earn 10 points from four matches at the Gtech Community Stadium in 2024/25, and on Saturday, it was their physical prowess that did the trick. Brentford bombarded Johnstone's goal at every opportunity, especially from set-pieces, and just over a minute had passed when Collins – who endured one difficult season at Molineux in 2022/23 – ghosted into the area to nod home. Pinnock took advantage of more miserable back-post defending from the visitors to add the Bees' fourth, and from there they could simply sit back and pick Wolves off on the break, with Janelt and Schade both close to extending their lead before Carvalho did the honours. Frank will now hope to use the upcoming break to recover some of his absentees, ahead of a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on 19 October. Club reports

Both sides traded blows early on, with Nathan Collins heading the hosts ahead with yet another early goal - this time in the second minute -  and Matheus Cunha levelling for the visitors before four minutes had elapsed. Some poor Wolves defending allowed Christian Norgaard to re-establish the hosts’ lead and Ethan Pinnock's header put Brentford further ahead just before half-time. Rayan Ait-Nouri pulled one back for Wolves at the death, but they stay bottom with just one point, while Brentford go ninth in the table with 10. Wolves were level in the fourth minute, though, as Cunha swept Nelson Semedo's cutback into the top-right corner. Brentford inched back into the lead after Collins was hauled over by Mario Lemina at a corner, allowing Mbeumo to convert from the penalty spot, but again Wolves responded as Larsen flicked Ait-Nouri's cross home. But the Wolves goalkeeper could only parry a Keane Lewis-Potter strike straight to Carvalho in the 90th minute, and the signing from Liverpool added a fifth. Wolves all at sea again
Saturday's match followed what has largely been the story of Wolves' season, with Gary O'Neil's men looking lively in attack, only to be undone by some woeful defending. Brentford fired set-piece after set-piece into the Wolves area, and the visiting backline – deprived of centre-back Yerson Mosquera after an anterior cruciate ligament injury – was simply unable to cope. Wolves have now conceded 22 league goals this season, failing to win any of their first seven Premier League matches for the first time since 2003/04, when they went on to finish bottom. O'Neil will also be particularly concerned by Wolves' lack of composure after getting back on terms. It is fair to say things do not get any easier for Wolves after the international break, with champions Manchester City visiting Molineux on 20 October. Brentford bombarded Johnstone's goal at every opportunity, especially from set-pieces, and just over a minute had passed when Collins – who endured one difficult season at Molineux in 2022/23 – ghosted into the area to nod home. Fourteen minutes later, Collins was involved again as he stole a march on Lemina from a corner, the Wolves captain dragging him to the ground to concede a needless spot-kick. Pinnock took advantage of more miserable back-post defending from the visitors to add the Bees' fourth, and from there they could simply sit back and pick Wolves off on the break, with Janelt and Schade both close to extending their lead before Carvalho did the honours.

318,318,brentford,2025-03-08,"Ollie Watkins proved the difference as Aston Villa got back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium. The striker came back to haunt his former club in the Premier League, beating Mark Flekken at his near post to score the winner early in the second half. Brentford pushed for an equaliser, with Keane Lewis-Potter striking a post, but they could not stop Villa from completing a first Premier League double over them as they recovered from their 4-1 loss at Crystal Palace last time out. Villa move up three places to seventh, just two points behind fourth-placed Manchester City, while Brentford are 12th on 38 points as their winless home run was extended to seven matches. How the match unfolded
Brentford were unable to take advantage of Villa’s shaky start and allowed the visitors to grow into the game, Tyrone Mings poking a free-kick straight at Flekken. Youri Tielemans cut open Brentford’s defence shortly after, bursting into the box, but Flekken parried his sliced effort. From the resulting corner, Ethan Pinnock almost scored an own goal, turning Tielemans’ nod down onto the roof of the net. Villa raced out of the blocks in the second half, Watkins netting against his former side for the sixth time after cutting inside and curling a shot through Flekken’s legs with the help of a slight deflection. Watkins turned provider to pull it back for Rogers, who fired it past Flekken, but the goal was ruled out by the referee following a VAR review as the former had strayed offside. Brentford pushed after that with Lewis-Potter coming closest, but his low strike from the edge of the box thumped the foot of the near post. Brentford’s home woes go on
Brentford had turned the Gtech into something of a fortress at the beginning of the season, winning seven of their first eight matches at home to start the campaign, but that is a long-distant memory now. Thomas Frank would have pinpointed this as a perfect chance to change their fortunes and continue their outside push for a European place, against a Villa side struggling on the road, but it was not to be. It took going behind for Brentford to come to life in the second half, with Lewis-Potter, in particular, proving a threat from the wing. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa eventually grew into the game, with the trio linking up into the build-up of Lewis-Potter hitting the woodwork. Robin Olsen denied Kevin Schade at his near post late on, and though they pushed until the final whistle, Brentford could find no way through. There were positives for Frank, though he may be glad to go on the road again, with a trip to Bournemouth up next. They had to dig in defensively, with Axel Disasi throwing his body on the line as the Bees’ pressure increased. Watkins arguably should have made sure of the points late on, racing into a one-v-one with Flekken, but his tame chip was well held by the goalkeeper. Club reports

Villa shut up shop
Villa had looked like they were slipping out of the race for a top-four finish, but considering the tight nature in the top half, they have kept themselves firmly in the fight with a win here. They also had to do without Emiliano Martinez, who was missing through injury. That form looked set to continue as Villa made a nervy start. Tielemans dug John McGinn out of a hole after he lost the ball in the box early on before Mings made a double block, though Schade had strayed offside. Unai Emery’s side finished the half strongly, and his half-time team talk lit a fire under the team, with Watkins taking just four minutes to clinically take his first chance of the match. Watkins arguably should have made sure of the points late on, racing into a one-v-one with Flekken, but his tame chip was well held by the goalkeeper. Villa face Club Brugge in the second leg of their Champions League tie in midweek, but are not in Premier League action again until 2 April when they travel to Brighton & Hove Albion. Club reports

Ryan Yates profited from Leicester’s failure to clear their lines for the opening goal, curling an effort beyond Mads Hermansen for only his second Premier League strike. The Foxes drew level through Jamie Vardy soon afterwards, though, with the veteran forward rounding off a fine move with a neat finish at the near post. The result moves Nott'm Forest to fifth, a point off the top four ahead of this weekend's action, while Leicester remain in 14th. How the match unfolded
An open start swung Forest's way as Facundo Buonanotte and James Justin’s attempts to clear the ball fell to Yates, who punished Leicester's slack defending in the 16th minute. But Forest's joy was short-lived when some neat build-up play ended with Harry Winks crossing for Vardy to poke beyond Matz Sels for his 194th Leicester goal seven minutes later. However, it was Hermansen who ended the half the busier of the two goalkeepers, producing two stunning saves to deny Nicolas Dominguez and Callum Hudson-Odoi. The triumph was capped on the hour-mark when Wood capitalised on another defensive lapse, this time from Wout Faes, as he looped a header over Hermansen to seal the bragging rights for Forest. Foxes made to pay for defensive errors
Leicester became known for their composed attempts to play out from the back under former boss Enzo Maresca, but they only played themselves into trouble on Friday. Despite Vardy getting them back on track, Leicester failed to learn from their previous mistake when Winks’ poor pass out from the back was picked off by Alex Moreno, with the ball eventually making its way to Wood, who finished smartly. Though the Foxes had found their feet in the Premier League with back-to-back victories heading into this match, they were reminded against that the slightest of mistakes can be punished in a flash in the top flight. No Nuno, no problem
Nuno Espirito Santo watched from the stands at the King Power Stadium as he served the second match of his three-game ban, but the Forest boss will have been delighted to see his side continue their fine start to the season. An open start saw chances fall to Buonanotte and Wilfred Ndidi, but the visitors were able to make the breakthrough, albeit through an unlikely source in Yates. After Vardy pegged Forest back, Wood continued his rich vein of form with a dominant second-half performance, though Nuno did not see the New Zealander’s first goal, returning to his seat eight minutes after the restart.

Jackson was involved in Chelsea’s second, too, as his header was saved by Hermansen, only for Fernandez to nod home the rebound for his first goal since February against Crystal Palace. Ayew made no mistake from the spot to set up a grandstand finale, but third-place Chelsea held firm to move to within a point of Manchester City, prior to the reigning Premier League champions’ clash with Tottenham Hotspur later on Saturday, while Leicester dropped down to 16th.

Wesley Fofana was perhaps fortunate not to give away a penalty for a challenge on Stephy Mavididi, but Leicester did get a spot-kick when VAR overturned an offside decision on Bobby De Cordova-Reid, who had been bundled over by Romeo Lavia. Ayew’s finish had too much power for Robert Sanchez, but it was too little too late for the Foxes. Many happy returns for Maresca
Enzo Maresca guided Leicester back to the Premier League at the first time of asking last season before switching his allegiance to Chelsea. Chelsea’s last win had come over Newcastle United at the end of October, but after draws against Manchester United and Arsenal, the Blues dominated much of the proceedings on Maresca’s former stomping ground. They were ultimately made to hang on somewhat, when the opportunities had been there to put themselves out of sight well before Leicester’s late resurgence. Leicester’s troubles mount up
An injury to Harry Winks only added to Steve Cooper's woes as his side find themselves right in the middle of a relegation scrap after another largely uninspiring display. The Foxes had already lost promising 20-year-old Ghana winger Abdul Fatawu for the remainder of the season after picking up a knee injury during the international break. And Winks, another of Leicester’s standout performers this season, lasted just about 10 minutes on Saturday before he was replaced by Oliver Skipp. Wilfred Ndidi, meanwhile, was perhaps lucky to escape harsher punishment for a late lunge on Palmer in the first half.

Enzo Maresca guided Leicester back to the Premier League at the first time of asking last season before switching his allegiance to Chelsea. And his side’s performance was further proof that Chelsea are heading in the right direction and ready to challenge for a top-four finish this season, at the very least. Chelsea’s last win had come over Newcastle United at the end of October, but after draws against Manchester United and Arsenal, the Blues dominated much of the proceedings on Maresca’s former stomping ground.

Both teams missed good opportunities to claim all three points in the second half as Wolves stay 17th, while David Moyes’ side climb to 14th. However, Wolves responded well and were level just seven minutes later. The hosts introduced Pablo Sarabia in place of the injured Munetsi at half-time, and the substitute almost made an immediate impact when his free-kick narrowly curled the wrong side of the post. Wolves inch further clear
After 18th-placed Ipswich Town were beaten by Crystal Palace earlier on Saturday, Wolves knew this was a decent opportunity to put even more distance between themselves and the relegation zone.

Marshall Munetsi cancelled out Jack Harrison’s deflected opener as the spoils were shared at Molineux. The in-form Toffees opened the scoring after 33 minutes as Harrison’s shot nestled in Jose Sa’s bottom-left corner following a deflection off Matt Doherty, end a run of 35 Premier League games without a goal for the winger. How the match unfolded
Everton carried the greater threat of the two sides early on. Emmanuel Agbadou blocked Abdoulaye Doucoure’s goalbound strike before the visitors broke the deadlock when Harrison’s shot deflected off Doherty to beat Sa. Bellegarde led the charge during a swift attack and threaded a pass into Munetsi, who neatly slotted a first-time shot past Jordan Pickford. Jorgen Strand Larsen called Pickford into action from a tight angle while, moments later, Beto was thwarted by Sa at the other end after Carlos Alcaraz led a rapid counter. They were second-best early on against a resurgent Everton. The Toffees issued a warning when Doucoure’s shot was blocked, though Wolves were unfortunate in the way they fell behind, as Doherty’s ricochet took Harrison’s shot beyond the reach of Sa. Moyes maintains momentum
Everton had only won once in their last seven Premier League visits to Molineux, but they arrived full of momentum following their recent resurgence. It is over eight years since the Toffees enjoyed such a long unbeaten run in the Premier League (nine games between December 2016 and February 2017 under Ronald Koeman), and their confident start was rewarded with the opening goal just past the half-hour mark. Harrison needed a bit of luck but will not have been complaining as he ended a 13-month wait to find the net in the Premier League. However, Everton's defence was carved open far too easily for Wolves’ equaliser, with Munetsi taking advantage to put his first-time shot well out of Pickford’s grasp. The introduction of the lively Alcaraz gave Everton fresh impetus on the counter in the second half, and his good work almost led to Beto putting them back in front. The Toffees will hope to build as much confidence as possible ahead of that tricky run. Club reports

Birthday boy Tomas Soucek provided the breakthrough for the Hammers 21 minutes in, and they did not look back from there as they claimed consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since March 2024, building neatly on their hard-fought victory at Arsenal. Jarrod Bowen played a huge part in West Ham’s second just before half-time, with his low finish deflecting in off Jannik Vestergaard for an own goal. West Ham leapfrog Everton into 15th, level on points with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. How the match unfolded
Wilfred Ndidi had the first meaningful attempt of the night when he tested Alphonse Areola – celebrating his 32nd birthday – though West Ham swiftly got in the ascendancy and took the lead midway through the first half. Aaron Cresswell’s dangerous cross was flicked into the path of Mohammed Kudus, whose close-range effort was parried by Mads Hermansen, but Soucek was on hand to tuck in the rebound. James Ward-Prowse’s corner dropped loose at the near post, and Bowen pounced to get a shot off, with Vestergaard only able to unwittingly turn it in. Substitute Stephy Mavididi produced a promising moment for the Foxes in the 69th minute, but Emerson’s header snuffed out the danger from the winger’s cross, and that was the closest Leicester came, with Harry Winks’ superb block at the other end preventing Evan Ferguson from adding a third West Ham goal. Home fortunes change for the Hammers
West Ham had lost their previous two Premier League home matches, beaten by Crystal Palace and Brentford. Earlier in the season, they had already suffered three straight home defeats under former head coach Julen Lopetegui, so Graham Potter would have been keen to ensure he did not match his predecessor. But the Hammers’ home fortunes took a welcome turn as they comfortably saw off Leicester. Verstergaard’s own goal, combined with Leicester’s slow build-up put West Ham in control and Potter – who stuck with the 3-5-2 formation he played against Arsenal last time out – will now feel he is truly up and running as West Ham boss. Leicester’s defence continues to leak
Leicester picked up what seemed like a vital 3-1 win over West Ham in the reverse fixture back in December in Ruud van Nistelrooy’s first match in charge, but the Foxes were devoid of energy and ideas this time around. There was little sign of a response here as a serious lack of proactive defending left the Hammers’ forwards, particularly Bowen and Kudus, with plenty of space. Club reports

Leicester picked up what seemed like a vital 3-1 win over West Ham in the reverse fixture back in December in Ruud van Nistelrooy’s first match in charge, but the Foxes were devoid of energy and ideas this time around. Soucek’s opener ensured that Leicester remained the only Premier League side without an away clean sheet this season. The Foxes have now shipped 32 goals across their 12 matches on the road – three months into Van Nistelrooy’s tenure, their defensive frailties are far from fixed, and may actually be getting worse. A series of errors cost Leicester heavily last week, a chaotic 15-minute spell in the first half paving the way for Brentford’s 4-0 rout at King Power Stadium. Leicester were simply too passive at the back again, their failure to clear inside the six-yard box twice leading to goals. With Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle, Brighton & Hove Albion and Liverpool all to come, Leicester are staring at a brutal run of fixtures that could make or break their season.

328,328,southampton,2024-11-24,"Liverpool went eight points clear at the top of the Premier League as they came from behind to seal a thrilling 3-2 victory over Southampton at St Mary's, thanks to two second-half goals from Mohamed Salah. Salah turned Sunday's match on its head after Mateus Fernandes had given bottom club Southampton a surprise 2-1 lead on 56 minutes. Fernandes swept home on the counter after being teed up by Adam Armstrong, who had equalised for Southampton late in the first half following Dominik Szoboszlai’s opener. However, Salah made it 2-2 not long after the hour then kept his nerve from the penalty spot on 83 minutes, as a handball from substitute Yukinari Sugawara proved costly for Southampton. How the match unfolded
It was a familiar story for Southampton as they played themselves into trouble on the half-hour mark. Downes was denied by Caoimhin Kelleher three minutes later, but Southampton were handed a golden chance to level when Andrew Robertson tripped Tyler Dibling on the 18-yard line in full flow, with the penalty awarded by referee Sam Barrott and confirmed after a VAR review. Kelleher saved Armstrong's penalty, but the striker tucked home the rebound to send Southampton into half-time level and he played a key role in the hosts taking the lead after the restart. Liverpool then laid siege to the Southampton area and when Sugawara handled Salah's inswinging cross, the Egyptian made no mistake, scoring the winner from the penalty spot. Southampton wanted an early penalty when Armstrong tumbled under pressure from Ibrahima Konate, only for replays to show any contact may have been just outside the area. Centre-back partner Virgil van Dijk – usually a model of consistency – then conceded possession with an unnecessary flick seconds before Dibling did win a spot-kick for Southampton. Martin does not let up on risk-v-reward approach
Russell Martin's approach at Southampton is all about taking risks and hopefully earning big rewards. Boos rang around St Mary's after Szoboszlai took advantage of a host of errors in the home defence for Liverpool’s opener. Martin would surely have been content to take a point, yet another mistake cost his team as Sugawara flicked out his right arm to concede a late spot-kick. There was plenty to admire about Southampton's performance, but with Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Spurs and Fulham to play in a daunting run of pre-Christmas fixtures, the Premier League's bottom club must cut out the errors.

Salah saves lacklustre Liverpool
Arne Slot would be the first to admit his Liverpool side were far from their controlled best on the south coast. The Reds entered Sunday's match with just six goals conceded in the Premier League this campaign. Centre-back partner Virgil van Dijk – usually a model of consistency – then conceded possession with an unnecessary flick seconds before Dibling did win a spot-kick for Southampton. Fortunately for Liverpool, they possess the type of star quality that allows them to grind out results when not at their best. While McCarthy's positioning was questionable, Salah showed excellent awareness to let a dropping ball run off the outside of his boot and into an unguarded net for Liverpool’s equaliser. It was Salah's own cross that led to the penalty he converted so emphatically to put Liverpool back in front, and he could have had a hat-trick when he smashed Luis Diaz's deflected cross against the post late on. Salah is now on 10 league goals, two behind league top scorer Erling Haaland, in what could be his final campaign at Anfield, and his form has certainly put the Reds well on course for a title tilt. Boos rang around St Mary's after Szoboszlai took advantage of a host of errors in the home defence for Liverpool’s opener. However, on a day of ups and downs, McCarthy may have to take a share of the blame for Liverpool's leveller, as Salah deftly touched Gravenberch's floated pass beyond him. Club reports

But Omari Hutchinson's deflected equaliser sent Ipswich deservedly into the break on level terms as the Tractor Boys responded well to the early setback. United were grateful to Andre Onana for a couple of big saves in a match in which they struggled to test Arijanet Muric in the Ipswich goal after their flying start. Ultimately, the spoils were shared and a point leaves Man Utd in 12th place, while Ipswich remain in the relegation zone in 18th. Onana made a fantastic stop to deny Liam Delap from close range but there was nothing he could do to prevent Hutchinson's bending 20-yard effort finding the top-left corner via a deflection off the head of Noussair Mazraoui. It might have been more for McKenna
Once upon a time, Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna was on the coaching staff at Old Trafford and he would have feared his old club running away with proceedings after Rashford's early opener. But Ipswich showed plenty of resilience after going behind so early on, and had Delap shown a bit more composure, they would have been level earlier in the half. As it was, the home side – who earned a first Premier League win of the campaign at Tottenham Hotspur prior to the international break – did have just rewards for their first-half efforts, even if Hutchinson's well-struck attempt did get a bit of a helping hand on the way in. Frustratingly for Ipswich, Onana was on hand to deny Delap again with another sublime stop after a clever flick from Wes Burns' centre. Ultimately, Ipswich – who are still without a win at home in the league this season – will view this as a valuable point in their bid to stave off relegation, but may feel that on a different day they could have taken all three.

Ultimately, the spoils were shared and a point leaves Man Utd in 12th place, while Ipswich remain in the relegation zone in 18th. How the match unfolded
Man Utd offered a quick glimpse of what they will be able to offer in the Premier League under their new head coach as Marcus Rashford tucked home the opener following fantastic work down the right flank from Amad Diallo. Amad almost had a second assist when he teed up Christian Eriksen, who shot wide of a left post from 20 yards, before Onana was called into action to parry Sam Szmodics' well-struck drive. Onana made a fantastic stop to deny Liam Delap from close range but there was nothing he could do to prevent Hutchinson's bending 20-yard effort finding the top-left corner via a deflection off the head of Noussair Mazraoui. Muric made a smart stop from Alejandro Garnacho before Onana's foot kept out Delap's ingenious flick in a fast start to the second half. Bruno Fernandes sent a whipped 25 yard free-kick just wide of the left post and Conor Chaplin poked straight at Onana after good work from Jack Clarke as both sides sought a winner that would not arrive.

United had to wait 23 days for Amorim to take charge of his first match following confirmation of his appointment at the start of November. Rashford himself will feel particularly vindicated after he received criticism in some quarters. Selected as the spearhead of Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation, Rashford – who scored on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United managerial bow back in 2018 – showed great predatory instincts to meet Amad's excellent, low cross. But the truth of the matter is there was very little goal threat from the visitors after that thrilling start, save for Garnacho's effort shortly after the break and Fernandes' decent free-kick.

332,332,everton,2024-10-26,"Beto’s stoppage-time equaliser secured a point for Everton as they came back to draw 1-1 against Fulham at Goodison Park. Fulham had been spared by the assistant’s offside flag in the first half, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin saw a goal ruled out for offside after Idrissa Gueye had struck the woodwork, though that was the closest Everton came until Beto came up with a close-range header in the 94th minute. While Fulham sit 10th after stopping the rot following two defeats on the bounce,Everton move up to 15th on nine points. Everton came agonisingly close twice in quick succession four minutes later as Gueye thundered a strike against the crossbar from 25 yards out. Calvert-Lewin pounced on the rebound to fire home, but he was flagged marginally offside, with VAR confirming the on-field decision. But Fulham’s breakthrough arrived just after the hour – former Everton playmaker Iwobi benefiting from Smith Rowe’s great work before drilling a low finish into the left-hand corner. Jimenez provides persistent threat for Fulham
In-form Jimenez proved a persistent threat to the Everton defence, and was unlucky not to register a goal contribution himself. He also showed a great turn of pace to surge onto a ball over the top after the break, but saw his first touch take it too close to Jordan Pickford. Beto the saviour
Despite their solid form coming into Saturday’s clash, Everton simply could not get going, and it looked like their old boys Iwobi and Silva would be returning to Merseyside to haunt them. All too often, Everton gave away cheap turnovers in the midfield or failed to execute moves in the final third as Sean Dyche’s men lacked impetus across the field. Up front, Calvert-Lewin badly needs a goal, and he thought he had one until the assistant’s flag went up, but otherwise he struggled to test Fulham’s centre-backs. Beto’s introduction in place of Calvert-Lewin was not exactly universally welcomed by the Everton faithful in the 81st minute, but any dissatisfaction soon turned to jubilation. Everton’s equaliser came from arguably their best move of the game, and Beto did well to keep his cool when the chance came. Club reports

Fulham had been spared by the assistant’s offside flag in the first half, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin saw a goal ruled out for offside after Idrissa Gueye had struck the woodwork, though that was the closest Everton came until Beto came up with a close-range header in the 94th minute. While Fulham sit 10th after stopping the rot following two defeats on the bounce,Everton move up to 15th on nine points. How the match unfolded
Fulham failed to make their dominance count for a chance until the 28th minute, when Emile Smith Rowe volleyed over the bar from Raul Jimenez’s header. But Fulham’s breakthrough arrived just after the hour – former Everton playmaker Iwobi benefiting from Smith Rowe’s great work before drilling a low finish into the left-hand corner. Iwobi was unlucky not to play a part in a Fulham second seven minutes later as he saw a volleyed cross-shot across goal cleared just ahead of the line. And Fulham’s failure to put the match to bed came back to bite them deep in added time. Jimenez provides persistent threat for Fulham
In-form Jimenez proved a persistent threat to the Everton defence, and was unlucky not to register a goal contribution himself. There were opportunities for Jimenez to turn provider too, setting up Smith-Rowe and Iwobi with chances in the box in the first half. Jimenez’s tireless running provided the platform for the excellent Iwobi and Smith Rowe to do the damage behind him – the only thing lacking for the Mexican at Goodison was a goal. Beto the saviour
Despite their solid form coming into Saturday’s clash, Everton simply could not get going, and it looked like their old boys Iwobi and Silva would be returning to Merseyside to haunt them. Up front, Calvert-Lewin badly needs a goal, and he thought he had one until the assistant’s flag went up, but otherwise he struggled to test Fulham’s centre-backs. Young’s first-time, on-the-volley cross set up the opportunity, but it still needed finishing, and Beto himself missed from point-blank range when these teams met at Craven Cottage last term.

334,334,manchester-city,2024-10-26,"Manchester City battled their way back to the Premier League summit as Erling Haaland netted the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Southampton at the Etihad Stadium. Haaland was on target early on with a clinical finish from inside the area, though City were unusually profligate in front of goal for the rest of Saturday’s contest. Haaland passed up two fantastic chances to make the scoreline more comfortable after the break, though City ultimately got the job done to move top ahead of
Sunday’s clash between Arsenal and Liverpool. How the match unfolded
Haaland needed just five minutes to break the deadlock as he got himself in front of Jan Bednarek to turn Matheus Nunes’ cross home. Nunes and Mateo Kovacic threatened with efforts from distance before City had a penalty appeal turned down, with VAR upholding the referee’s judgment that Taylor Harwood-Bellis had not purposefully handled in the area. For all City’s dominance, Southampton spurned a glorious chance to go level in first-half stoppage time – Cameron Archer’s shot at the end of a counter clattering the crossbar. Haaland then missed three opportunities in the space of two minutes after the break, seeing a header cleared off the line by Harwood-Bellis and the one saved by Aaron Ramsdale, before somehow putting Savinho’s cross wide at the far post. Southampton substitute Adam Armstrong twice went close before Haaland was again thwarted by Ramsdale in stoppage time, albeit his wasteful finishing did not come back to bite Pep Guardiola’s team. City fail to turn dominance into goals
City were unable to make their opportunities count in an attempt to improve their goal difference against their closest title rivals, and if they had been facing a team with a bit more clinical edge than Southampton, they would perhaps have been punished. Haaland was still City’s difference maker but will surely be disappointed not to have scored more, despite adding an 11th league goal of the season to his tally. City’s goal difference of +11 is only bettered by Arne Slot’s Liverpool, who will be looking to cash in on the champions’ wastefulness at the Emirates against Arsenal on Sunday. In a title race that looks set to be so tight, though, then there may not be any margin for error, and Guardiola will likely be hammering it into his players that next time out, they must rediscover that finishing touch to put games to bed. Haaland’s goal did not deter them from building up from the back, though they were almost undone when Ramsdale’s poor pass was picked off by Bernado Silva, but the resulting attack was well defended by Harwood-Bellis. Saints knew chances would be rare and needed to take them when they arrived, with Archer’s first-half strike the closest they came to breaching City’s defence. Club reports

Much has been made of Southampton’s commitment to sticking to their possession-based principles under Russell Martin, but they again impressed against a potential Premier League title contender, having also gone toe-to-toe with Arsenal. The visitors’ frustrations began to show when Flynn Downes was shown a yellow card for his protests after a tackle on Silva, with Martin also cautioned. Saints knew chances would be rare and needed to take them when they arrived, with Archer’s first-half strike the closest they came to breaching City’s defence. The introduction of towering forward Paul Onuachu offered them a different option for the final knockings, but Southampton remain winless and are now looking up at the rest of the league from 20th.

336,336,newcastle-united,2024-11-25,"Tomas Soucek and Aaron Wan-Bissaka scored as West Ham United defeated Newcastle United 2-0 at St James' Park on Monday to ease the pressure on boss Julen Lopetegui. Newcastle entered the game on a three-match winning run, including back-to-back victories in the Premier League, but it was a previously out-of-form West Ham side who came out on top. Soucek profited from some poor Newcastle defending to head West Ham into a 10th-minute lead, then Wan-Bissaka fired in his first goal for the Hammers early in the second half. That second goal took the wind out of Newcastle's sails and they failed to test Lukasz Fabianski from then on, slumping to a second loss in their last three home league matches. West Ham stay 14th in the table but are now within three points off Newcastle, who drop a place to 10th, still four points adrift of the top four. How the match unfolded
After Alexander Isak saw a chipped finish disallowed for offside in the early stages, West Ham took the lead against the run of play. Fabianski then produced a great save to deny Anthony Gordon from close range and Isak fired off-target with just the West Ham goalkeeper to beat before the interval. Newcastle's frustration grew eight minutes into the second half as Jarrod Bowen fed the ball to Wan-Bissaka, who found the net via the far post. That second goal took the wind out of Newcastle's sails and they failed to test Fabianski from then on, slumping to a second loss in their last three home league matches. Callum Wilson saw a penalty appeal turned down after being introduced for his first appearance of the season, but Newcastle otherwise struggled to offer much of a response as the visitors saw out a comfortable win. Isak and Newcastle struggle to fire
Newcastle's fans serenaded striker Isak ahead of the match with a colourful display spelling out his name behind one of the goals, but he was unable to repay them on the field. Gordon also lacked his usual spark in front of goal, unable to make the most of some impressive creative play from Newcastle's outstanding performer Bruno Guimaraes, and a lack of threat in the final third is now becoming a concern for Eddie Howe's men. This is the third time the Magpies have failed to find the net in their past six league outings, and after scoring 85 Premier League goals last season, they have mustered just 13 in 2024/25. Howe's side had finally built some momentum prior to the international break with wins over Arsenal and Nottingham Forest, but this represented a return to their rather below-par displays from earlier on in the season. With a trip to struggling Crystal Palace up next before Liverpool visit Tyneside in nine days' time, Howe will be demanding better. While Soucek now has four Premier League goals against Newcastle, Wan-Bissaka might be pinching himself after ending a three-year goal drought in the competition. Indeed, his last strike came against Newcastle. West Ham had been accused of being too passive under Lopetegui but that was certainly not the case at St James' Park, as they continued to throw men forward even at 2-0 up, with Bowen a particularly bright spark on the counter.

After Alexander Isak saw a chipped finish disallowed for offside in the early stages, West Ham took the lead against the run of play. Emerson swung a corner in from the left and an unmarked Soucek headed into the bottom-right corner from 10 yards out. Fabianski then produced a great save to deny Anthony Gordon from close range and Isak fired off-target with just the West Ham goalkeeper to beat before the interval. Newcastle's frustration grew eight minutes into the second half as Jarrod Bowen fed the ball to Wan-Bissaka, who found the net via the far post. Lopetegui gets lift-off
Lopetegui had come under growing pressure at West Ham, having made a slow start since replacing David Moyes ahead of the 2024/25 campaign, but this welcome victory will lift the clouds of doom. The Hammers benefitted from fast starts to both halves, netting from their first attempt after kick-off and their first shot after the restart. West Ham had been accused of being too passive under Lopetegui but that was certainly not the case at St James' Park, as they continued to throw men forward even at 2-0 up, with Bowen a particularly bright spark on the counter. Now closer – in terms of points – to the European spots than the relegation zone, Lopetegui will hope this win is a turning point ahead of Saturday's London derby versus Arsenal. Club reports

338,338,nottingham-forest,2025-02-26,"Arsenal lost more ground to leaders Liverpool in the Premier League title race after being held to a 0-0 draw by Nottingham Forest. In a contest between second and third at the City Ground, neither side were able to claim the win needed to boost their lofty ambitions this season. Riccardo Calafiori struck a post in the first half for Arsenal, who turned the screw after the break having struggled to break down Forest’s stern defensive rearguard. Forest are six points behind the Gunners, though now only one ahead of fourth-placed Manchester City. Arsenal had to wait until after half-time to test Matz Sels, with Merino’s header from a Declan Rice corner tipped up by the Forest goalkeeper, before Tierney also missed the mark from a set-piece. Forest were able to withstand the wave of Arsenal pressure and almost went ahead against the run of play in the 70th minute, but David Raya was equal to Chris Wood’s strike. Martin Odegaard’s blushes were then spared by the offside flag after the midfielder twice was denied from inside the box, first by Murillo’s sliding challenge and then the palms of Sels. Forest were still a threat, though, with Callum Hudson-Odoi flashing an effort over the crossbar late on before Thomas Partey dragged his strike from the edge of the box wide of the mark as the spoils were shared. Forest keep European ambitions on track
After back-to-back defeats in the Premier League, Forest knew a big performance was needed. Forest, as they often do, were happy to soak up the pressure before hitting Arsenal on the counter. That tactic almost succeeded when Morgan Gibbs-White sent Wood through on goal, but Forest’s top scorer was brilliantly halted by Gabriel. The hosts found themselves on the back foot in the second half, with Arsenal dominating the possession and creating the better chances, with Ryan Yates and Danilo introduced to try and inject some energy into the middle of the park. That double substitution allowed Forest to wrestle back an element of control, with Wood first denied by Raya before William Saliba’s excellently timed tackle thwarted the New Zealand international once again as he raced towards goal. Forest can use this point as momentum, with another huge encounter next up at the City Ground on 8 March when Man City roll into town. Calafiori endured an eventful start to the game, picking up a yellow card in the third minute for a tug on Hudson-Odoi’s shirt before being faced with the Forest winger again, who went down in the box under his challenge, which went unpunished by referee Andy Madley.

Ahead of kick-off, Arteta said that Arsenal will not stop fighting for the Premier League title despite the gap to leaders Liverpool, but this result seemingly saw the title edge ever closer to Merseyside rather than north London. The Italian also hit a post while Rice saw a strike deflect over. Though Arsenal looked better in the final third compared to their defeat to West Ham United, their makeshift frontline, with Merino at the top, was unable to muster a shot on target in the first half. But the Gunners’ improvement after the interval was stark, with back-to-back corners seeing Merino and Tierney heading narrowly wide. Arteta will continue to try and find a solution to his attacking problems, and will be hoping to kickstart his side’s revival away at Manchester United next. Club reports

Sunday's loss to Liverpool left last season’s Premier League champions 20 points adrift of the leaders and Chelsea's 4-0 win over Southampton on Tuesday saw City drop out of the top four. But Pep Guardiola's side produced a dominant first-half performance in north London, which was rewarded when Haaland tapped home on his return from injury for his 20th Premier League goal of the season. Spurs struggled to create chances before the break but should have levelled 10 minutes into the second half, as Pedro Porro's whipped cross was prodded wide by Wilson Odobert. Mathys Tel and Brennan Johnson missed half-chances as Spurs finally put City under sustained pressure, then substitute Son Heung-min saw a scuffed effort repelled by Ederson. Spurs almost made that reprieve count in the eighth additional minute, but Sarr headed over from the centre of the box as City clung on. Postecoglou's changes fall flat
Spurs have endured plenty of lows in 2024/25, but November's reverse fixture at the Etihad Stadium represented the high point of their campaign, and arguably of the entire Ange Postecoglou era. Despite being without first-choice centre-backs Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, Spurs tore City to shreds in a 4-0 win, with Dejan Kulusevski and Son contributing to a scintillating counter-attacking performance. But both Kulusevski and Son dropped to the bench here and Spurs failed to show anything as an attacking force in the first half. After Tel sent a tame flick into Ederson's arms in the fifth minute, they went 40 minutes without attempting a shot of any description. Spurs improved dramatically after half-time but were wasteful in their finishing, with Sarr missing their best chance when left totally unmarked in the final action of the match. With Spurs having eight days to rest up for their next fixture – the first leg of their UEFA Europa League last-16 tie against AZ Alkmaar – fans might wonder whether Postecoglou's decision to rotate his attack was misguided. That competition represents Spurs' final shot at silverware this season, and a nine-point gap separates them from the top half of the Premier League table.

But Pep Guardiola's side produced a dominant first-half performance in north London, which was rewarded when Haaland tapped home on his return from injury for his 20th Premier League goal of the season. Haaland saw a late second disallowed for handball following a VAR check that confirmed the referee’s on-field decision, while Pape Sarr missed a glaring chance to level when he headed over in the 98th minute. The hosts stay 13th in the table with 33 points, while City are now just one point behind third-placed Nottingham Forest, who they face in their next league match. How the match unfolded
Haaland had already forced one save from Guglielmo Vicario by the time he gave City a 12th-minute lead, sweeping Jeremy Doku's low cross home from six yards out. Doku should have had two further assists by the half-hour mark. First, his searching cross was somehow turned over by the unmarked Savinho, then he found Haaland in another brilliant position only for Vicario to make a vital close-range save. Mathys Tel and Brennan Johnson missed half-chances as Spurs finally put City under sustained pressure, then substitute Son Heung-min saw a scuffed effort repelled by Ederson. Haaland thought he had made the points safe in stoppage time, but the referee’s on-field decision to disallow the goal for handball was confirmed following a VAR review.

City inch over the line
This week, Guardiola refuted suggestions that re-establishing City's dominance will be the toughest task of his career, pointing out that the Citizens have already been through multiple rebuilds since he arrived in 2016. Many expect City to refresh their squad when the curtain comes down on their underwhelming campaign and, while this performance demonstrated there is work to be done, it also showed they have players capable of contributing in the future. Doku produced a lively display on the left-hand side and, with better finishing from his team-mates, he would have had three assists by the half-hour mark. Then there is Haaland. Guardiola was visibly concerned by City's lack of control after the break, but they rode their luck to get over the line.

Kaoru Mitoma gave the Seagulls a 29th-minute lead after stealing in front of compatriot Yukinari Sugawara to head beyond top-flight debutant Joe Lumley. Friday’s draw moves Brighton, at least temporarily, two places behind leaders Liverpool, who play Manchester City in a heavyweight contest on Sunday, while Southampton remain bottom. How the match unfolded
After a confident start, Southampton almost found themselves behind early on when Sugawara’s loose touch presented the ball to Mitoma, but the Seagulls winger was unable to profit. Georginio Rutter then crashed an effort against a post before Danny Welbeck nodded wide, but Brighton’s dominance finally prevailed when Tariq Lamptey’s teasing delivery was brilliantly headed home by Mitoma. That decision contributed to 10 minutes of stoppage time, and Brighton almost found a late winner when Mitoma picked out Simon Adingra, but his effort glanced off a post.

While Brighton moved up to second in the Premier League table, they missed a massive chance to put some distance between themselves and the chasing pack, seemingly taking their foot off the gas after half-time. The Seagulls have now drawn with two of the three promoted sides this season, and it could prove crucial for their lofty aspirations of ending the campaign in the top four. The hosts had several chances to open the scoring before Mitoma’s well-taken header, with Rutter and Welbeck going close, but were made to pay for their wastefulness in front of goal. The Seagulls were perhaps fortunate to come away with a point after Archer’s disallowed strike, but they did have chances of their own to snatch a winner during second-half stoppage time through Adingra, who went agonisingly close. Saints show their worth
Russell Martin has insisted his side have made improvements despite their position in the table, and that was on show, particularly in the second half against Brighton. Brighton continued to assert their dominance and were rewarded through Mitoma, but Martin was seen visibly upset at how easily the Japan international was able to ghost in at the far post.

343,343,southampton,2024-11-29,"Brighton & Hove Albion moved up to third in the Premier League table despite being held to a 1-1 draw by south coast rivals Southampton at Amex Stadium. Flynn Downes then drew the Saints level just before the hour-mark with a well-taken finish from the edge of the area, netting his first Premier League goal. Southampton thought they had earned a first away victory of the season when Cameron Archer turned home from close range eight minutes later, only to see it ruled out for offside on pitch and confirmed by VAR. Friday’s draw moves Brighton, at least temporarily, two places behind leaders Liverpool, who play Manchester City in a heavyweight contest on Sunday, while Southampton remain bottom. How the match unfolded
After a confident start, Southampton almost found themselves behind early on when Sugawara’s loose touch presented the ball to Mitoma, but the Seagulls winger was unable to profit. Saints show their worth

Saints were able to hold on for a crucial point in their bid to avoid relegation, though face a tough test against Chelsea on Wednesday, made even more difficult with Downes, Tyler Dibling and Taylor Harwood-Bellis suspended after picking up their fifth yellow cards this season.

344,344,liverpool,2025-02-26,"Liverpool moved 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League table with a 2-0 win over Newcastle United at a jubilant Anfield on Wednesday. Goals from Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister gave Liverpool their latest victory, while second-placed Arsenal fell further off the pace after a draw with Nottingham Forest. Overseen in the dugout by Johnny Heitinga, with head coach Arne Slot and assistant Sipke Hulshoff serving touchline bans, the league leaders took another significant step towards a much-anticipated title with only 10 matches to play. Liverpool did not have it all their own way, but Newcastle's hopes of dealing a blow to their upcoming EFL Cup final opponents were hampered by the absence of top scorer Alexander Isak due to a groin issue. Eddie Howe's side are left sixth, three points off the top four in a UEFA Champions League chase that now looks rather tighter than Liverpool's title fight. How the match unfolded
Liverpool had seen an early penalty appeal waved away even before their first shot brought an 11th-minute breakthrough, with Szoboszlai's low effort creeping past Nick Pope following Luis Diaz's cutback. Szoboszlai and Mohamed Salah then each shot off target, but goalmouth action was scarce until Mac Allister doubled Liverpool's lead in the 63rd minute. Salah shimmied in the box and created space for a square pass to the midfielder, who swept into the top-left corner. Salah's superb pass might have seen Diaz add a third when he prodded wide at full stretch, then Liverpool's star man drew a low stop from Pope, who was later adjudged to have been fouled when he spilled the ball in front of his goal line and Cody Gakpo poked in. It was comfortable by that stage for Liverpool, with Newcastle's challenge fading fast as the away side worked instead to cap the scoring at two. Szoboszlai steps up for Slot's side
This win brought an end to a gruelling stretch of the season for Liverpool, who have played five league games in the space of two weeks. But rather than see their title tilt knocked off course by a testing schedule, the Reds have thrived. Salah had scored in each of the Reds’ prior four matches, yet he acknowledged to TNT Sports ahead of facing Newcastle: ""You're not going to win the league alone, so you want other players to also perform. Now, with a week before their next game at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, he and Liverpool can regroup ahead of the run-in. Anfield agony again for Newcastle
In a nine-game winning sequence in all competitions that transformed Newcastle's season across December and January, they won at both Old Trafford and Emirates Stadium, arenas that had proved impenetrable for past Magpies teams. But Anfield, like the Etihad Stadium, continues to represent a step too far. Newcastle's last win away at Liverpool came back in 1995. This was at least not the same meek surrender that had seen Newcastle blown apart by City in their previous away game, with the visitors going toe-to-toe with Liverpool for a time, but Howe's call for his players to be brave ultimately proved their undoing. As Newcastle sought to attack in numbers, the gaps their full-backs left behind were exploited by Liverpool. Tino Livramento was out of position as Diaz advanced for the first goal, while Hall was still scrambling to recover as Salah laid on the second. Club reports

Danny Welbeck opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time before Evan Ferguson appeared to put the game to bed five minutes from time with an incisive strike from the edge of the box. Brighton sit fifth while Wolves move up to 19th in the Premier League table, overtaking Southampton. It took 45 minutes for Brighton and in-form striker Welbeck to make the breakthrough. Despite increasing pressure from Wolves, Ferguson doubled Brighton's lead in the 85th minute. Against the odds, the visitors completed the comeback five minutes later as Doyle intercepted from a three-man Brighton overload at the back before firing a long ball forward, which Cunha received to fire home and snatch a point. Welbeck keeps on firing
Brighton seemed to struggle to execute the final ball in their attacking moves in the first half, with Wolves’ low block proving resistant. That was certainly the case in the 45th minute when he finally made good on Brighton’s pressure. This time, he saw his shot blocked from close range but once more, he offered Brighton’s biggest threat. It was unsurprising when the Amex Stadium crowd sang Welbeck’s name given his scintillating form, though their backline was unable to get them over the line in the end. Faced with four Brighton forwards rushing towards him on the edge of his own box, the Englishman stepped forward to intercept as Wolves’ last man before starting an attack of his own. Wolves had come out resurgent after the break and slowly put pressure on a Brighton side that looked utterly dominant in the first half. When Ferguson fired in their second against the run of play five minutes from time, it would have been understandable to see Wolves’ spirit break. Club reports

Brighton sit fifth while Wolves move up to 19th in the Premier League table, overtaking Southampton. How the match unfolded
The visitors had the best chance of the opening 10 minutes when Cunha pulled back from the left byline to find Tommy Doyle unmarked at the edge of the box, but he fired over. A double half-time substitution gave Wolves fresh impetus, though, as Jorgen Strand Larsen directed a free header at Bart Verbruggen straight after the break. Despite increasing pressure from Wolves, Ferguson doubled Brighton's lead in the 85th minute. Ait-Nouri finally made Wolves’ efforts pay as he seized on a loose ball from a corner to fire home from inside the box in the 88th minute. Against the odds, the visitors completed the comeback five minutes later as Doyle intercepted from a three-man Brighton overload at the back before firing a long ball forward, which Cunha received to fire home and snatch a point. Welbeck keeps on firing
Brighton seemed to struggle to execute the final ball in their attacking moves in the first half, with Wolves’ low block proving resistant. A brilliant run in behind the Wolves defence allowed Rutter to play a throughball into his path, and he made no mistake to stroke home with confidence. Welbeck threatened again in the 62nd minute as he seized on Pablo Sarabia’s mistake at the back to surge into the box. O’Neil’s men still fighting 
Doyle’s heroic interception to start the Wolves move for their equaliser epitomised the fight in O’Neil’s side. Faced with four Brighton forwards rushing towards him on the edge of his own box, the Englishman stepped forward to intercept as Wolves’ last man before starting an attack of his own. The outcome proved to be decisive as Cunha’s late equaliser doubled the visitors’ points tally this season. Wolves had come out resurgent after the break and slowly put pressure on a Brighton side that looked utterly dominant in the first half. When Ferguson fired in their second against the run of play five minutes from time, it would have been understandable to see Wolves’ spirit break. Ait-Nouri’s near-immediate response finally saw their pressure pay and gave them something to fight for, before Doyle’s intervention set Cunha free to finish the job. Wolves still remain second from bottom on just two points, but their effort today indicates a side still set on delivering for O’Neil. Club reports

348,348,brentford,2024-10-26,"Bryan Mbeumo’s late goal sunk 10-man Ipswich Town as Brentford came out 4-3 winner from a chaotic and dramatic Premier League match at the Gtech Community Stadium. However, the game was flipped on its head just before the break, as Yoane Wissa slotted home and then forced an own goal from the luckless Harry Clarke, who subsequently conceded a penalty early in the second half. Mbeumo slammed home from 12 yards, and Clarke’s day got worse when he received his second booking, only for Ipswich to fightback through Liam Delap’s 86th-minute goal. Yet Mbeumo had the final say as his cross found the net deep in stoppage time. The win moves Brentford to ninth while Ipswich remain 16th, without a win to their name. How the match unfolded
Despite the final result, there was little goalmouth action early on before Hirst teed up Szmodics to fire past Mark Flekken in the 28th minute. But as Ipswich failed to find an immediate third, with Szmodics missing a chance, Brentford struck twice in as many minutes. Wissa halved the deficit before squeezing a shot under Arijanet Muric that the unfortunate Clarke bundled over his own line. Brentford were revved up after the restart, as Keane Lewis-Potter caught Clarke cold to win a penalty. Mbeumo coolly converted to put the Bees ahead. But the Bees had a final sting in their tail in the sixth minute of stoppage time as Mbeumo’s hopeful cross into the area crept into the far corner. Wissa and Mbeumo and rule after Toney’s exit
Despite the exit of their most high-profile name in Ivan Toney, Brentford fans were confident over the Wissa-Mbeumo axis thriving in the post-Toney era, and the signs look very positive. Wissa's breakthrough strike in the Bees’ first-half comeback, and his key role in forcing Clarke's own goal, combined with Mbeumo taking centre stage after the interval, showed just how adept the duo are at pulling defences out of shape. Mbeumo's sharpness to drop in and link with the midfield eases the pressure on Brentford's engine room with Wissa's pace and directness in behind giving the feel of a throwback front two. There was a touch of fortune about Mbeumo’s winner, but his confidence from the spot earlier on proves he is excelling as one of Brentford’s go-to men. Thomas Frank’s side had a tough time of it last season, but if Mbeumo and Wissa stay fit, then a top-half finish is on the cards. A goal on his first Premier League start at Manchester City lifted some of the early pressure on his shoulders, but goals have been hard to come by since, with his opener against Brentford just his second league strike of the season.

Converting impressive Championship form into Premier League consistency is always a challenge and Ipswich will have known that when they made a summer move for Republic of Ireland midfielder Szmodics. However, his wider role in this Ipswich team shows the threat he carries; tenacious off the ball and willing to make life uncomfortable for opposition defences. Replaced on 73 minutes, another battling shift underlines McKenna's confidence, even if Delap's goals continue to grab the headlines for Ipswich. But now, the Tractor Boys have to find a way to keep it tight at the back if they are to collect that first victory of the season. Club reports

Yet quickfire strikes from Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Emerson gave West Ham hope, though their chances of a comeback were quashed when Bukayo Saka, who also provided two assists, added Arsenal’s fifth on the stroke of half-time. Arsenal now sit six points behind leaders Liverpool, who face a heavyweight clash with Manchester City on Sunday, while West Ham remain in 14th. However, Wan-Bissaka scored his second goal in as many games after ghosting in behind Arsenal’s defence with Emerson’s stunning free-kick putting West Ham right back into it. Gabriel was punched by Fabianski, with VAR confirming Anthony Taylor’s on-field decision of penalty, and Saka’s finish had too much power for West Ham’s goalkeeper. West Ham's defence crumbles
The Hammers’ win over Newcastle United on Monday eased some of the pressure on Julen Lopetegui, who had to watch this match from the stands due to suspension. With flashbacks to their 6-0 defeat in this exact fixture last season surely crossing some minds, the home fans at least got some respite when West Ham pulled two back against the run of play. Wan-Bissaka has the scoring touch at the moment, and finished coolly after latching onto a great ball from Carlos Soler, while Emerson’s free-kick, which clattered in off the woodwork, was delightful. It was only a short-lived reprieve, though, as Arsenal took advantage of West Ham’s defensive sluggishness on another set-piece before the break, with Gabriel once again given too much freedom before he was taken out by Fabianski’s glove. Edson Alvarez was brought on at half-time to try and steady the ship, and the hosts did appear more balanced, but they are yet to find consistency, something Lopetegui will need to address sooner rather than later if the Hammers are to stay clear of danger. Arsenal’s attack worked fluidly in the first half, with Trossard’s goal the perfect example of that as they sliced open West Ham’s defence with ease. Ruben Amorim’s United will almost certainly pose more of a challenge than West Ham, but with Manchester City faltering, the Gunners are proving they are still a force to be reckoned with.

Yet quickfire strikes from Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Emerson gave West Ham hope, though their chances of a comeback were quashed when Bukayo Saka, who also provided two assists, added Arsenal’s fifth on the stroke of half-time. It is only the fourth time in Premier League history that there have been four goals scored in a single half, but the Gunners put in a more measured display after the interval to ensure there was no hint of further drama. Arsenal now sit six points behind leaders Liverpool, who face a heavyweight clash with Manchester City on Sunday, while West Ham remain in 14th. How the match unfolded
Saka created Arsenal’s first two goals, with his 10th-minute corner headed home by Gabriel before the England winger laid it on a plate for Trossard to tuck in a second before the half-hour. With those passes, Saka became the first player to reach double figures for assists across Europe's top five leagues. Two goals in as many minutes then looked to have put the Gunners out of sight – Odegaard slotted in from the penalty spot after Lucas Paqueta fouled Saka before Havertz profited from some slack defending to coolly beat Lukasz Fabianski one-v-one. However, Wan-Bissaka scored his second goal in as many games after ghosting in behind Arsenal’s defence with Emerson’s stunning free-kick putting West Ham right back into it. Yet Arsenal restored a three-goal cushion in first-half stoppage time. Gabriel was punched by Fabianski, with VAR confirming Anthony Taylor’s on-field decision of penalty, and Saka’s finish had too much power for West Ham’s goalkeeper. Michail Antonio almost cut the deficit again after the break, though his effort deflected narrowly wide, while Danny Ings could only drill wide after rounding David Raya late on as Arsenal held out for an emphatic triumph. The frustration in the stadium was palpable as Arsenal racked up four goals with relative ease, with some home fans leaving their seats as soon as Odegaard’s penalty hit the back of the net. Wan-Bissaka has the scoring touch at the moment, and finished coolly after latching onto a great ball from Carlos Soler, while Emerson’s free-kick, which clattered in off the woodwork, was delightful. It was only a short-lived reprieve, though, as Arsenal took advantage of West Ham’s defensive sluggishness on another set-piece before the break, with Gabriel once again given too much freedom before he was taken out by Fabianski’s glove. Arsenal back on track
After a slight wobble before the international break, Arsenal have come back firing in the last two weeks, following up their 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest last weekend in style. Arsenal’s attack worked fluidly in the first half, with Trossard’s goal the perfect example of that as they sliced open West Ham’s defence with ease. With a 5-1 win over Sporting CP in the Champions League also under their belts, Arsenal have now scored 13 goals in their last three matches in all competitions, and it is surely no coincidence that it has coincided with Odegaard’s return from injury. His link-up with Saka in particular proved unstoppable at times. Ruben Amorim’s United will almost certainly pose more of a challenge than West Ham, but with Manchester City faltering, the Gunners are proving they are still a force to be reckoned with.

352,352,brighton-and-hove-albion,2025-02-25,"Danny Welbeck produced the decisive goal as Brighton & Hove Albion snatched a vital 2-1 win over fellow European hopefuls AFC Bournemouth. Substitute Welbeck scored within four minutes of his introduction, calmly finishing with his left foot to secure Brighton's third straight Premier League win and boost their hopes of a top-four finish. It was Welbeck's 30th Premier League goal for Brighton, the joint-most for the Seagulls in the competition along with Pascal Gross. Brighton's rapid start had earlier been rewarded when Bournemouth goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga clumsily felled Joao Pedro, who opened the scoring with a 12th-minute penalty at the Amex Stadium. However, Justin Kluivert levelled with a stunning effort just past the hour before Brighton – despite being on the ropes – delivered their counter-attacking blow with 15 minutes remaining. Welbeck's vital impact from the bench saw Brighton move into eighth, level on points with seventh-placed Bournemouth, who are part of the chasing pack within touching distance of the top four. How the match unfolded
Kepa rushed out and tripped Joao Pedro after Diego Gomez's delicate through-ball, and the Brazilian striker made no mistake by stroking the penalty to his left, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way. Antoine Semenyo should have levelled just past the half-hour mark but fired straight at Bart Verbruggen, while Kaoru Mitoma's acrobatic volley struck the post at the other end following a delightful delivery from Tariq Lamptey. Brilliant Brighton find a way
Fabian Hurzeler may have been concerned after a record 7-0 thumping by Nottingham Forest to start the month, though his side responded with handsome victories over Chelsea and Southampton. Brighton smashed four goals in Saturday's rout of Ivan Juric's Saints, and came flying out of the blocks here as Rutter headed wide after Kepa made a mess of a simple cross. Mitoma then touched narrowly off target after Gomez's smart through-ball, and Brighton's new midfielder repeated the dose with another incisive pass in behind Dean Huijsen to tee up Joao Pedro to win the penalty. Vibrant winger Mitoma was again afforded too much room by makeshift full-back Lewis Cook, ghosting inside onto Lamptey's cross before striking Kepa's left-hand post with a well-timed volley. Hurzeler will still have decisions to ponder at the back, with Bournemouth regularly cutting through Brighton without reward, but their resilience in the face of relentless second-half pressure will please the German head coach. Brighton's next league task will be to back up this victory and make it four straight wins when they host Fulham, another European challenger, at the Amex on 8 March. Iraola concern for blunt Bournemouth
Back-to-back defeats against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Brighton may concern Andoni Iraola, although the Cherries were reduced to 10 men early on against Vitor Pereira's side on Saturday. Bournemouth's defence sorely missed the suspended Illia Zabarnyi, with James Hill struggling to support Huijsen in a wave of early Brighton pressure that was rewarded by Joao Pedro's opener.

Welbeck's vital impact from the bench saw Brighton move into eighth, level on points with seventh-placed Bournemouth, who are part of the chasing pack within touching distance of the top four. A moment of individual brilliance restored parity for Bournemouth as Milos Kerkez played a simple offload to Kluivert, who cut inside from the left and whipped it into the top-right corner from a tight angle at the edge of the box. Bournemouth almost struck a double blow soon after, but Verbruggen produced an expert stop from close range after Marcus Tavernier's effort had deflected into Dango Ouattara’s path.

Bournemouth's defence sorely missed the suspended Illia Zabarnyi, with James Hill struggling to support Huijsen in a wave of early Brighton pressure that was rewarded by Joao Pedro's opener. Iraola's side still created plenty of chances at the other end – Ryan Christie forced an early save on the stretch by Verbruggen before Ouattara headed Semenyo's left-wing cross harmlessly over. Luis Sinisterra's low cross-shot was then palmed away by Verbruggen in the dying seconds, with Evanilson unable to pounce, leaving Bournemouth unable to find a way back. For all of their attacking impetus, Iraola will be desperate for his side to find their clinical edge before next visiting Tottenham Hotspur in the competition. Club reports

354,354,wolverhampton,2024-11-30,"Justin Kluivert became the first player to score a hat-trick of penalties in a single Premier League game as AFC Bournemouth punished an error-strewn display from Wolverhampton Wanderers to win 4-2 at Molineux. Kluivert’s third-minute spot-kick started the scoring after Evanilson was brought down by Toti Gomes, only for Jorgen Strand Larsen to level for the hosts with a fine header soon after. Saturday’s away win moves Bournemouth up to 11th on 18 points, while Wolves go 18th. How the match unfolded
A frenetic opening started when Evanilson tangled with Gomes inside the box during the opening minute, with Kluivert stepping up to send Sa the wrong way from the penalty spot. However, parity was restored two minutes later as Jean-Ricner Bellegarde’s teasing delivery was powerfully met by the head of Strand Larsen, though Wolves’ joy was short-lived. A fine move ended with Kerkez firing in at the near post, before Evanilson was tripped by Sa after the Wolves goalkeeper failed to clear his lines, with the decision given by referee Peter Bankes following a VAR review as Kluivert doubled his tally from 12 yards. Wolves will be frustrated by errors
After impressive back-to-back victories that highlighted Wolves’ plethora of attacking talent, it was their defence that was put under the microscope after an error-filled display at home. Gary O’Neil’s side were architects of their own downfall, with defensive lapses from Gomes and Sa gifting Bournemouth two goals. The hosts did have penalty appeals of their own waved away when Rodrigo Gomes was felled inside the box following Matheus Cunha’s overhit free-kick in first-half stoppage time. Wolves continued to make sloppy errors, with Mario Lemina, starting in central defence, producing an expertly-timed challenge to deny Kerkez, though substitute Dawson’s first involvement saw him pick up a yellow card after a loose pass caused him to lunge in on Evanilson. Wolves will be hopeful of stamping out those errors in their next game against Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. Club reports

The Cherries took the lead again through Milos Kerkez before doubling their advantage through Kluivert’s second penalty, but were pegged back by Strand Larsen once again after the break. Saturday’s away win moves Bournemouth up to 11th on 18 points, while Wolves go 18th. Gary O’Neil’s side were architects of their own downfall, with defensive lapses from Gomes and Sa gifting Bournemouth two goals. They failed to learn their lesson, allowing chance after chance for the Cherries in the first half with avoidable mistakes at the back. After Strand Larsen had offered hope of a comeback, Dawson’s sloppy backpass one minute and 26 seconds later handed Bournemouth the victory. Dutch delight for the Cherries
Kluivert’s historic showing will see him receive many of the plaudits, but Bournemouth were worthy winners in an impressive away performance. In a pulsating opening 18 minutes, the Cherries could have found themselves even further than two goals in front after carving out chances with ease. Bournemouth’s ability to press high on their opponents gathered boos from the home supporters at half-time, and they continued that good work from the first half. Club reports

Ross Barkley came off the bench to find the breakthrough for Unai Emery's side, but there was to be a twist in second-half stoppage time. Substitute Evanilson headed in from a free-kick to snatch a point for the Cherries, ensuring Villa failed to remain within touching distance of the summit. Third-placed Villa are now five points behind leaders Manchester City while Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth sit 10th, having collected 12 points from nine matches. How the match unfolded
Ollie Watkins and Youri Tielemans tested Travers, deputising for the injured Kepa Arrizabalaga, inside the first quarter-hour as the hosts started well. Travers remained busy as he kept out Amadou Onana’s header in the 23rd minute, before tipping an Ezri Konsa strike behind. In between those chances, Villa captain John McGinn had the ball in the net when he curled a left-footed strike into the top corner, but the goal was disallowed after a VAR review as Watkins failed to keep the ball in play in the build-up. Emery introduced Barkley and in-form striker Jhon Duran early in the second half as Travers continued his fine display between the sticks, making back-to-back saves to deny Pau Torres and Watkins around the hour mark. Three of Villa’s substitutes combined for Villa’s opener as Ian Maatsen crossed the ball in towards Leon Bailey, who knocked it back for Barkley to turn it home. Emery’s men thought that goal was enough to secure three points, but the Cherries had other plans. Villa held after another European night
Villa sit pretty at the top of the 36-team Champions League table after winning all three of their matches so far. After the win against Young Boys, Emery's side needed a late comeback to earn three points against bottom side Wolves, while they had to settle for a goalless draw against Manchester United following the defeat of Bayern Munich. Emery made more changes on Saturday than on the previous two occasions with Watkins replacing Duran up top and Matty Cash, Konsa, Lucas Digne and Jacob Ramsey all coming into the side that beat Bologna on Tuesday. With the matches coming thick and fast, Emery’s side will need to learn the art of juggling domestic and European competitions if they are to keep pushing for a top-four finish in the league this campaign. And Iraola’s men managed to keep the momentum going as they showed tremendous character to earn a point against an impressive side at Villa Park.

Jean-Philippe Mateta and Eddie Nketiah were also on target for the Eagles, who recorded only their third top-flight victory at Selhurst Park this season. Palace were not to be denied though, as Mateta’s thunderous effort gave them the lead again, before Sarr's exquisite volley made matters more comfortable. Nketiah’s first league goal for Palace added further gloss to a brilliant win late on. Oliver Glasner’s team stay 12th, but are just one point behind Brentford and six off 10th-placed Villa, who have played one more match. How the match unfolded
Palace drew first blood in the 29th minute. Emiliano Martinez could only parry Chris Richards' header from an Adam Wharton cross straight to Sarr, who made no mistake from close range. Sarr and Mateta squandered decent opportunities to double Palace’s lead, before Villa thought they had equalised. Wharton and Eberechi Eze combined to tee up Mateta, who confidently fired home. Wonderful Wharton makes his case to Tuchel
Given their impressive form on the road, the target for Palace was to transfer it to Selhurst Park, and they certainly did that in this match. England head coach Thomas Tuchel watched from the stands, and he will have been very impressed by the performance of the returning Wharton. Mateta, who scored a hat-trick when Palace won the corresponding fixture last season 5-0, was also the scourge of Villa once more, as he got the crucial goal that propelled the Eagles back into the lead. Palace will head into Saturday’s FA Cup clash with Millwall full of confidence, before their next two Premier League fixtures come against sides in the bottom three, Ipswich Town and Southampton. Villa’s away woes roll on
Buoyed by their comeback win over Chelsea, Villa started brightly at Selhurst Park, with Youri Tielemans heading wide and Jacob Ramsey having a smart finish ruled out for offside, before Sarr put them behind. But the visitors always looked vulnerable to Palace’s pace and power at the other end of the field, and so it proved. Club reports

360,360,nottingham-forest,2024-11-30,"Chris Wood’s penalty proved decisive as Nottingham Forest beat Ipswich Town 1-0 to return to winning ways in the Premier League, as he became the club's joint-top goalscorer in Premier League history along with Bryan Roy on 24 goals. Ipswich goalkeeper Muric performed well throughout to keep his side in the contest, but Wood’s club-record equalling strike was the difference at the City Ground. Both sides went close in an even first half, but Forest were the much better of the two after the break, and despite a late charge from the visitors, Nuno Esiprito Santo’s team held on to snap a two-game losing streak. Forest sit in sixth, just a point behind second-placed Manchester City, while Ipswich remain in 19th. How the match unfolded
Morgan Gibbs-White might have got Forest off to a dream start in the opening minute, but his header from a corner flashed wide. That chance paved the way for Forest to dominate the early exchanges, with Muric denying Callum Hudson-Odoi while Ryan Yates’ attempt was hooked off the line by Szmodics. Yet Forest had the lead when Wood smashed emphatically home from 12 yards in the 49th minute, after Silva went down under Szmodics’ challenge. Muric brilliantly clawed away Murillo’s header to deny Forest before following up with an outstretched arm to prevent the rebound falling to a Forest player in the box. Forest were not made to pay for their failure to double their advantage, with Jack Clarke snatching at Ipswich’s best opportunity, sending a tame effort into Sels’ gloves. Wood the main man as Forest bounce back
Nuno’s side had made a fabulous start to their league campaign, but successive defeats to Newcastle United and Arsenal, with six goals conceded across those losses, had halted their early momentum. But they set the tone early on through chances for Gibbs-White and Hudson-Odoi, and though Ipswich gained a foothold as the first half wore on, a rapid start to the second period proved the difference. Only Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah have scored more than the New Zealand international in the Premier League so far this season, and his goals are proving vital to what could well prove to be Forest’s best Premier League season since the 1994/95 campaign, when they finished third. It is the might of reigning champions Manchester City next up for Forest, though with Pep Guardiola’s team in poor form – and facing Liverpool on Sunday – Nuno’s men may just fancy their chances heading to the Etihad Stadium. They struggled to get out of first gear after half-time, though, failing to effectively deal with the aerial threat of the likes of Wood and Murillo from set pieces, but Muric performed admirably between the sticks.

A dent for the Tractor Boys
Ipswich came into Saturday’s contest in good form. Indeed, the Tractor Boys were arguably the better side in that match at Portman Road last week. Yet a fourth straight game without defeat eluded Kieran McKenna, despite some promising signs – particularly in the first half. Hutchinson looked sharp down the right and Liam Delap got in the way of Conor Chaplin when he seemed ready to finish from close range. Clarke’s effort was the closest they came after going behind and McKenna will be concerned at the lack of end product when his team were chasing the match, but a kinder fixture list still gives them an opportunity to get out of the relegation zone as Christmas approaches.

362,362,wolverhampton,2025-02-25,"Wolverhampton Wanderers missed the chance to move further clear of the relegation zone as they fell to a 2-1 defeat at home to Fulham. But the home side weren’t behind for long, getting level in the 18th minute through a crashing strike from Joao Gomes after Fulham failed to clear their lines. Wolves remain 17th in the table, five points clear of Ipswich Town having played a game more while Fulham move up to ninth, ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference. How the match unfolded
Fulham took the lead in the first minute of the match, as Andreas Pereira threaded a pass through for Sessegnon and he finished coolly past Jose Sa to stun Molineux. The home side responded well to going behind so early and equalised in the 18th minute as Gomes smashed an effort into the roof of the net after the away side failed to deal with a dangerous cross from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Both sides went close during the remainder of the half, with Santiago Bueno making a superb block to deny Muniz’s goalbound effort while Bernd Leno acrobatically tipped over Matheus Cunha’s stinging shot. Wolves struggled to create opportunities as the half wore on, with the away side going close twice in the final 10 minutes through Raul Jimenez, but he squandered both chances. Wolves fail to back up away win
Wolves were hopeful of backing up their impressive away win at Bournemouth and further bolstering their survival prospects but were dealt a huge blow after going behind with just a minute on the clock, as the visitors made light work of their defensive line. There was a positive response to going behind, with Bellegarde threatening at points and Gomes already going close just two minutes before his goal with a shot that whistled over the bar from a tight angle.

But the home side weren’t behind for long, getting level in the 18th minute through a crashing strike from Joao Gomes after Fulham failed to clear their lines. Fulham got in front again just 63 seconds into the second half after Rodrigo Muniz applied a cool, lofted finish to hand the away side all three points. Wolves remain 17th in the table, five points clear of Ipswich Town having played a game more while Fulham move up to ninth, ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference. How the match unfolded
Fulham took the lead in the first minute of the match, as Andreas Pereira threaded a pass through for Sessegnon and he finished coolly past Jose Sa to stun Molineux. Both sides went close during the remainder of the half, with Santiago Bueno making a superb block to deny Muniz’s goalbound effort while Bernd Leno acrobatically tipped over Matheus Cunha’s stinging shot. The Cottagers made a similarly fast start in the second half, going ahead again as Adama Traore fizzed a ball through for Muniz who delightfully chipped the ball over the onrushing Sa. The home side started the second 45 with similar sloppiness, as a breakdown in possession within the first minute of the half contributed to Fulham taking the lead once more. Fulham return to winning ways
A rare misstep at home to Crystal Palace saw Marco Silva shuffle his pack for tonight’s match, with five changes and perhaps one eye on the crucial FA Cup fifth-round tie away to Manchester United on Sunday. Despite the change in personnel, Silva’s men made a stunning start with three of the players drafted into the side combining. Muniz held the ball up before finding Pereira, who in turn set up Sessegnon to score his first Premier League goal since rejoining the club in the summer. It was a fantastic moment for the travelling Fulham fans, though they quickly surrendered that lead and remained under the cosh at various moments of the first half. His fine, curling pass set Muniz clean through with the Brazilian finishing beautifully to give Fulham the lead once more. Silva’s men professionally saw out the rest of the half to make it four successive away wins in all competitions. The Cottagers now travel to Old Trafford for a repeat of the 2023 FA Cup quarter-final, then have a Premier League game away to Brighton and Hove Albion on 8 March. Club reports

364,364,crystal-palace,2024-11-30,"Daniel Munoz salvaged a dramatic 1-1 draw for Crystal Palace against Newcastle United in the Premier League on Saturday. Yet Guehi played his part in an equaliser Palace deserved on the balance of play, as his floated cross was turned home by Munoz to spark jubilant celebrations at Selhurst Park. Palace move out of the relegation zone on goal difference, while Newcastle stay in 10th, as they missed the chance to move within a point of the top four. How the match unfolded
After a disjointed start owing to a spurt of Newcastle injuries, Palace got on top, and Pope made a sharp stop with his legs to keep out Ismaila Sarr, though the offside flag would have denied him anyway. That profligacy came back to haunt Palace after the break as a cleverly worked Newcastle free-kick carved them open, and Guehi inadvertently turned Gordon’s cutback into his own net. Sarr was thwarted by Pope again just after the hour-mark, with the goalkeeper smothering his chip before Dan Burn blocked Munoz’s follow-up at the near post, while Jean-Philippe Mateta volleyed high over the bar from close range. But Palace kept pushing until the end, and their was delight for their fans when Munoz peeled off at the back post to convert from Guehi’s delivery. Palace show their mettle 
Oliver Glasner believes Palace’s performances have been getting better in recent weeks, but he could not deny that they needed a win at the start of a busy schedule. The Eagles have struggled to score at home this season, something they would have felt confident in rectifying with Eberechi Eze back from a hamstring injury. He carved out a good opening early on, only to have the ball stolen by Fabian Schar before he could take his shot, while he also linked up well with Sarr, who proved troublesome down Palace’s right. Despite Sarr’s pressure, he could not find a way past Newcastle’s goalkeeper, and even as Justin Devenny, who scored his first Premier League goal against Aston Villa last week was introduced along with Eddie Nketiah, it looked like Palace would draw another blank – until Munoz’s late intervention, that is. While Palace will feel they deserved all three points, they now travel to Ipswich Town with a spring in their step as they search for a first away win of the season. Pressure back on Newcastle 
After their disappointing loss to West Ham on Monday, and a trip to struggling Palace presented what looked like a great chance to bounce back. However, the Magpies failed to get going at Selhurst Park and were not helped when Alexander Isak had to make way early on due to what looked like a recurrence of a hip injury. Harvey Barnes replaced the forward and provided a threat from the right wing with fizzing low crosses, but with nobody to meet them in the box, the Palace defence comfortably dealt with the danger.",Crystal Palace_2024-11-30,newcastle-united,oliver-glasner,eddie-howe,1,1,13,3,1,49,1.76,5,16,0,8,12,402,30,11,3,0,4,0,7,5,12,4,4,2,24,1,2,320,22,46,22,0,59,9,48,18,9,30,13,53,24,0,0,-1.0,0,0,3,51,0.04,0,1,2,9,11,418,12,12,3,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,12,4,2,338,22,46,29,0,41,14,30,16,6,12,8,49,25,1,2,-0.0747,1,3,8

366,366,chelsea,2025-02-25,"Chelsea got back to winning ways and returned to the Premier League's top four by thrashing lowly Southampton 4-0 at Stamford Bridge. The pressure was on the Blues following three straight defeats in all competitions, but they had far too much quality for Ivan Juric's strugglers. The result sees Enzo Maresca’s team leapfrog Bournemouth, Newcastle United and Manchester City to go fourth, though the latter two sides are in action on Wednesday. How the match unfolded
The first major chance fell Chelsea's way in the 23rd minute as Cole Palmer was slipped in behind by Enzo Fernandez, only to see his shot smothered by Aaron Ramsdale. But the Blues did break through from the resulting corner. Palmer skewed wide when presented with another good chance on the right side of the area, but Neto soon doubled Chelsea's lead with a powerful near-post finish after being fed by Nkunku. Chelsea went on the hunt for more goals in the second half, but Ramsdale got down well to repel Nkunku's header before teenage substitute Tyrique George fired over from a tight angle. Chelsea's supporting cast step up
Chelsea approached Tuesday's game under mounting pressure, with tentative talk of a title bid prior to Christmas having been replaced by concern over their hopes of European qualification. The downturn in form experienced by Palmer has not helped matters, with the Blues talisman failing to provide a goal or an assist in six consecutive games across all competitions ahead of this one. Palmer’s struggles continued as he squandered two huge chances in the first half, losing a one-on-one duel with Ramsdale then appearing to be caught in two minds as he sent an awkward attempt rolling across goal and wide. But if any team should have the depth to cope when their star attacker is not at his best, it is Chelsea. Chelsea's poor run had coincided with a tricky set of fixtures, but with a home game against struggling Leicester City up next on March 9, they now have a chance to build some momentum. Southampton errors continue
Like Chelsea, Southampton entered this game having lost their last three, with Saturday's 4-0 defeat to Brighton prompting some stern words from head coach Juric. Southampton were still in the contest at that point, but yet another individual error granted Chelsea daylight, with Flynn Downes sending a sloppy pass straight to Cucurella in the build-up to Neto's goal. When Cucurella himself hit the target late on, he capped a move that started with Jack Stephens having a shot blocked on the edge of Chelsea's box, with Southampton's defenders nowhere to be seen as the Blues quickly worked a five-on-three break.

Like Chelsea, Southampton entered this game having lost their last three, with Saturday's 4-0 defeat to Brighton prompting some stern words from head coach Juric. Juric described Southampton's performance in that match as a ""disaster"" adding that with safety now a long shot, the coming weeks are about ensuring his team are equipped for a speedy return to the top flight. The Southampton boss responded to that defeat by making a host of changes to his lineup, and one of the players he introduced – Paul Onuachu – twice went close in the first half.

368,368,brentford,2024-11-30,"Kevin Schade’s first career hat-trick ensured Brentford remained unbeaten at home as they saw off Leicester City 4-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium. After Ruud van Nistelrooy was announced as the new manager on Friday, first-team coach Ben Dawson led a poor Leicester display as Thomas Frank’s men delivered another goalfest. Facundo Buonanotte gave Leicester fans hope of a new beginning as he put the visitors ahead after 21 minutes, but Yoane Wissa ensured their joy did not last for long, equalising four minutes later. Schade then put the hosts ahead soon after, before grabbing his second just before half-time and completing his hat-trick before the hour to put the Bees in control. The result moves Brentford up to seventh, just two points off the Champions League spots. How the match unfolded
Brentford showed early threat five minutes in when Mads Hermansen was forced into a fantastic fingertip save from Schade, who flicked a looping header goalwards from the centre of the box. But Brentford were back on level terms four minutes later in near-identical fashion. Schade found himself in behind on the right and sent a low cross into the box, where Wissa could tap into an empty net at the back post. The hosts went one better within another four minutes as Bryan Mbeumo’s deflected low cross fell to Schade on the left of the box, who powered home at the near post. Damsgaard was unlucky not to find the net himself, as his stooping header deflected Mbeumo’s cross off the right just over the bar after the break. The Brentford forward was pivotal in the hosts’ opener as he raced down the left to beat the Leicester defence and find Wissa at the far post to tap home with ease. As Mbeumo’s cross found him in space to the left of the box, the German showed great composure to take a touch before driving home at the near post to put his side ahead. While it was a long time coming, Schade helped Brentford’s goal glut in style. New Foxes formation won’t provide immediate answers for new manager
The visitors switched to three at the back at the Gtech Community Stadium but found themselves vulnerable in defence. It was weighted to perfection and on a plate for Wissa at the back post. The recovering Leicester defenders found themselves grouped together in the centre as Brentford could ping the ball from Mbeumo to Schade and finish. Club reports

370,370,newcastle-united,2025-02-23,"Alexander Isak scored twice as Newcastle United survived a late fightback to down fellow top-four hopefuls Nottingham Forest 4-3 in an enthralling Premier League contest. James' Park crowd, but Newcastle roared back emphatically with four goals in just 11 first-half minutes. Lewis Miley restored parity before Jacob Murphy – who was at fault for Forest's opening goal – sent Eddie Howe's side ahead two minutes later. Isak's stuttering penalty, awarded after a VAR review for a handball by Ola Aina, furthered Newcastle's lead before the Swedish striker netted another for his 50th Premier League goal to cap a chaotic turnaround. Nikola Milenkovic's cute finish and a late Ryan Yates strike had Newcastle reeling but they held on to move fifth, just three points adrift of Forest, who could drop to fourth if Manchester City beat leaders Liverpool later on Sunday. Aina's arm was deemed to be in an unnatural position to block another Hall cross after a VAR review and Isak just sneaked his unconvincing penalty past Sels, despite the Forest goalkeeper getting a hand to the spot-kick down the middle. Isak made it two goals in as many minutes when powering onto Joe Willock's pass, with his left-footed drive looping over the powerless Sels thanks to a Murillo deflection. Milenkovic pulled a goal back for Forest to make it 4-2, flicking Chris Wood's cross-shot past Nick Pope in the 63rd minute before Newcastle just about held on for victory after Yates turned home Morgan Gibbs-White's blocked volley in the 90th minute. Milestone-man Isak inspires Newcastle
Newcastle were way off the pace in their 4-0 hammering by Man City last time out and may have been fearing the worst after Hudson-Odoi's opener against the run of play. The hosts could have levelled when Miley's volley was deflected wide by Murillo before Anthony Gordon narrowly missed Tino Livramento's fizzing cross. Their deserved reward soon arrived, though, as Miley showed composure belying his youthful age to score before Murphy's instinctive positioning made amends for his earlier error. Hall continued to enjoy his freedom down the left and again punished Forest when the VAR recommended an on-field review for Aina's handball, with Isak fortuitously finishing after referee Jarred Gillett overturned his original call. Fabian Schar was denied by the crossbar after the interval, heading onto the woodwork from Hall's corner, though Howe will have just been relieved to survive waves of late Forest pressure for the victory. This vital win sets Newcastle up nicely in their top-four pursuit before Wednesday's visit to leaders Liverpool. Comeback task too great after uncharacteristic Forest collapse
Forest's brilliant start to this campaign leaves them controlling their top-four destiny, though following up the Fulham defeat with this loss to Newcastle will concern Nuno Espirito Santo. However, Aina was then repeatedly exposed on their right, with little cover offered by Anthony Elanga and Nicolas Dominguez, as all four Newcastle goals started from that flank. Elanga somehow smashed over after Neco Williams' headed back across goal in the second half, though Milenkovic's inventive finish placed Newcastle firmly on the ropes. Forest wanted a last-gasp penalty after Gordon collided with Yates from behind, though referee Gillett waved away those protests as their first-half collapse ultimately proved too much to come back from.

An unmarked Murillo then headed narrowly wide and Gibbs-White's cross almost caught Pope out before Yates poached from close range after Schar's block to set up a grandstand finish. Forest wanted a last-gasp penalty after Gordon collided with Yates from behind, though referee Gillett waved away those protests as their first-half collapse ultimately proved too much to come back from. Regardless of their second-half improvements, Nuno will be desperate for a response in Wednesday's home match with Arsenal, who are six points clear of Forest. Club reports

372,372,crystal-palace,2024-10-27,"Jean-Philippe Mateta made the difference as Crystal Palace beat Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 to claim their first Premier League win of the season. Coming off the back of three straight defeats, the pressure was on Oliver Glasner, and his team delivered the goods for their fans at Selhurst Park. Their winner came in the 31st minute when Mateta latched onto Eberechi Eze’s clever flick and drilled in from close range. While Brennan Johnson saw a shot hit a post for Spurs, Palace looked most likely to get the match's second goal, and Eze saw one ruled out for offside before Adam Wharton was thwarted by Guglielmo Vicario. Palace were not made to pay for failing to add a second, however, as they claimed a morale-boosting result that takes them up to 17th, while Spurs are eighth after two defeats from their last three league matches. How the match unfolded
Palace went close when Will Hughes – an early substitute for Jefferson Lerma – exchanged a one-two with Wharton from a corner on the left and whipped in a cross, but Maxence Lacroix headed over. But Palace’s breakthrough arrived four minutes later as Daniel Munoz seized on an error from Micky van de Ven. The right-back’s delivery was flicked on by Eze, with Mateta able to take a touch and fire home. Eze appeared to have doubled Palace’s lead after running onto a ball over the top from Wharton and slotting home, but the goal was disallowed after VAR confirmed the on-field offside decision. Vicario brilliantly denied Ismaila Sarr and Wharton either side of Eze volleying over, though Spurs could not make their goalkeeper’s good work count at the other end. Eze gets Eagles soaring
Eze was once more a driving force as Glasner’s team finally secured a much-needed victory. He was instrumental in Palace’s opener as he directed Munoz’s slightly wayward cross with a deft flick behind him to Mateta at the back post. The dynamism instilled by Eze in the Palace attack soon saw them emerge as the team on top for much of the second half. Just minutes later, the England international sparked claims of a penalty around Selhurst Park, going down under pressure from Van de Ven after a darting run. It has not been a flying start to the season for Eze or Palace, but they will hope this game represents a corner turned. Club reports

But Palace’s breakthrough arrived four minutes later as Daniel Munoz seized on an error from Micky van de Ven. Spurs nearly restored parity before the break as Johnson hit the post before Trevoh Chalobah cleared off the line, while Dean Henderson denied James Maddison. Vicario brilliantly denied Ismaila Sarr and Wharton either side of Eze volleying over, though Spurs could not make their goalkeeper’s good work count at the other end. He saw a goal ruled out just after the restart having started his run from the halfway line marginally too soon, but the move signalled his intent, and Spurs would have done well to heed the warning. Just minutes later, the England international sparked claims of a penalty around Selhurst Park, going down under pressure from Van de Ven after a darting run. It has not been a flying start to the season for Eze or Palace, but they will hope this game represents a corner turned. No Son, big problems for Spurs
It was a tepid looking effort up front from Ange Postecoglou’s side despite the Australian’s liking for an all-out attacking approach. The visitors looked like a side without ideas going forward, with defender Van de Ven arguably creating their best chance of the match when his strike was deflected onto a post by Johnson before the ricochet had to be scooped off the line by Chalobah. Johnson found the Swede at the near post with a cross from the right before he side-footed the ball wide of goal. While the intent was there, the outcome was short of what was desired, and all too often Spurs found themselves wanting in the final third as they managed just three shots on target all match. It was indicative of their struggles without injured star player Son Heung-min, who was badly missed, and that will be a concern for Postecoglou. Club reports

Palmer, who had an early strike disallowed for offside, was integral to both of Chelsea’s goals on Sunday, playing a stunning pass in the build-up to Nicolas Jackson’s 18th-minute opener. Alexander Isak drew the visitors level with his first goal since returning from a toe injury, tucking home a cross from former Chelsea player Lewis Hall. But Palmer got his name on the scoresheet early in the second half, with his effort squeezing in at Nick Pope’s near post and Newcastle were unable to find a response. Chelsea’s triumph moves them five points ahead of 12th-placed Newcastle. How the match unfolded
The Blues thought they had made an ideal start when Palmer was slipped through by Jackson before he finished past Pope, only for the goal to be overturned for offside after a VAR review. But Palmer played a key role in the opener, sweeping an inch-perfect long-range pass into the path of Pedro Neto, who squared for Jackson to tap home. Yet Palmer restored Chelsea’s advantage 75 seconds after the restart, firing the ball in low from a cute angle, before Neto then struck a post with a header soon after. Chelsea seemed set to have the chance to seal the result with a third when Christopher Nkunku was hauled down by Dan Burn in the box late on, but the on-field decision of a penalty was overturned after another VAR review. And leading up to the Magpies’ equaliser, it was Almiron who looked most likely to threaten Robert Sanchez’s goal, curling an effort narrowly wide of the far post before forcing the Chelsea goalkeeper into a save five minutes before Isak struck. Isak was twice denied when his header was blocked by Reece James, before rounding Sanchez, only to see the retreating Moises Caicedo make a timely interception. James passes Maresca test
Ahead of kick-off, Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca expressed that he “wanted more” from captain James, who is only just back from injury, and he responded positively to his manager’s criticism despite a slow start on Sunday. James, operating on the opposite flank at left-back, was arguably at fault for Isak’s leveller after the Newcastle striker ghosted in front of him. But James bounced back well, producing several key interceptions after the break, including denying Isak by blocking his goal-bound effort and setting his side up on a counter-attack that almost led to a goal at the other end. Chelsea could have been out of site when Mykhailo Mudryk was set up by Palmer, but he could only find the hands of Pope, though with Newcastle pushing for an equaliser, James came to the Blues’ rescue to brilliantly head over Joe Willock’s cross in the dying stages. James’ return to form is a welcome boost for Maresca and the full-back will want to continue the upward trajectory as Chelsea aim to keep up their strong start. Club reports

Newcastle, however, responded brightly and were rewarded when Isak nudged in from Hall’s inviting delivery, with the goal given after VAR confirmed the Swede had not strayed into an offside position. Newcastle feel Gordon's absence
Eddie Howe’s side are now without a win in five league matches, and the task of halting that run was not helped by Anthony Gordon missing the trip after suffering a groin injury. Miguel Almiron was the man tasked with filling Gordon’s shoes in attack, joining Isak and Harvey Barnes in Newcastle’s front three. And leading up to the Magpies’ equaliser, it was Almiron who looked most likely to threaten Robert Sanchez’s goal, curling an effort narrowly wide of the far post before forcing the Chelsea goalkeeper into a save five minutes before Isak struck. Despite being second best for much of the second half, Newcastle still had their chances. Isak was twice denied when his header was blocked by Reece James, before rounding Sanchez, only to see the retreating Moises Caicedo make a timely interception. But the Magpies search for a league win to snap this poor run rolls on. If Gordon had been in their ranks, then maybe the outcome would have been different. James, operating on the opposite flank at left-back, was arguably at fault for Isak’s leveller after the Newcastle striker ghosted in front of him.

376,376,arsenal,2024-10-27,"Mohamed Salah proved the saviour for Liverpool as they twice fought back to earn a 2-2 draw against Arsenal in a pulsating encounter between two Premier League title rivals at the Emirates Stadium. The Egyptian finished a clinical Liverpool counter-attack on 81 minutes to earn a point, capping a second half that saw Arsenal lose Gabriel Magalhaes to injury and Jurrien Timber also forced off. Bukayo Saka had given Arsenal a ninth-minute lead with his 50th Premier League strike and Mikel Merino's first Gunners goal had them in front by the break after Virgil van Dijk's equaliser. Arne Slot's men are consequently second in the table, just a point behind leaders Manchester City, while Mikel Arteta's Gunners are five off top spot in third. How the match unfolded
Saka struck first when he received Ben White's excellent long ball in the right-hand channel, then turned Andrew Robertson and lashed past Caoimhin Kelleher at his near post. Merino fluffed his lines from one Declan Rice set-piece but just before the break, but he made no mistake at the second attempt as he headed home from the England midfielder's delicious whipped free-kick to restore Arsenal's lead. Liverpool gained more of a foothold when Arsenal lost Gabriel and Timber after the interval, though, and they had the hosts noticeably penned deeper inside their own half. Defensive woes prove too much for Arsenal
Last week's defeat at AFC Bournemouth not only put a dent in Arsenal's title hopes, but it also came at the cost of a suspension for William Saliba. With Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu injured, Arteta faced a headache that was partially solved by the return of Timber and saw Thomas Partey play at right-back. It was a solution that initially appeared to work, though it has to be said the return of Saka – missing against Bournemouth and Shakhtar Donetsk through injury – was also a huge boost. Robertson struggled all game to get a grip of Saka, who became the youngest Arsenal player to reach a half-century of Premier League goals. Rice was also typically excellent and Merino saw one inviting delivery from his team-mate come off his heel, though the chance for his goal soon afterwards was almost unmissable, such was the quality of Rice's cross. But you could sense a shift when Gabriel and Timber exited the field in the second half and, although Liverpool initially struggled to find the killer ball, Arsenal's resolve finally yielded and Arteta will now face a nervy wait to learn the extent of his latest injury woes. Liverpool show their mettle
Liverpool knew this was a great chance to really enhance their title credentials and the absence of Saliba for the Gunners will have provided a big pre-game boost. The Reds will be disappointed with the opener, not just Robertson getting turned but Van Dijk being nowhere on the cover to thwart Saka, who was also on target when Arsenal won last season's corresponding fixture 3-1 in February. But in fairness to the Reds, they showed character and the second half was already becoming more attritional prior to Arsenal's injury misfortune. Club reports

378,378,manchester-city,2025-02-23,"Liverpool took a big stride towards winning the Premier League title after Mohamed Salah starred in a statement 2-0 win over Manchester City. The Liverpool-City rivalry has been one of the standout stories of recent seasons, but Arne Slot’s team proved their title credentials with a superb display at the Etihad Stadium. City, without the injured Erling Haaland, had their moments, but never truly came close to a comeback as Liverpool claimed their first league win Man City since 2015. Liverpool are now 11 points clear of Arsenal, who lost to West Ham United on Saturday, albeit having played a match more, while City stay in fourth. How the match unfolded
A bright City start faded when Rico Lewis was caught in possession by Curtis Jones, leading to Luis Diaz forcing a corner. Alisson tipped a fine Marmoush effort wide as City searched for a response, but that was the closest the hosts came. When City started brightly, it was Salah who offered the Reds’ first meaningful threat, getting away from Ake with a wicked turn of pace down the right flank. Haaland’s absence felt
Haaland was watching on from the stands after he was not deemed fit to feature – City’s superstar striker having sustained an injury in the 4-0 win over Newcastle United last week. And Pep Guardiola will have been lamenting his lack of a focal point, as City did actually manage to create plenty of opportunities that Haaland would have surely relished. One battle City did win on the day was between Jeremy Doku and Trent Alexander-Arnold. The Liverpool full-back was regularly beaten by Doku, who also managed to deliver some excellent crosses, but there was no natural No 9 there to gobble them up. Marmoush, fresh from his hat-trick against Newcastle, did an admirable job and showed his quality with that neat first-half finish that went in off a post, only to be denied by the offside flag, but it is a case of what might have been for City.

The Liverpool-City rivalry has been one of the standout stories of recent seasons, but Arne Slot’s team proved their title credentials with a superb display at the Etihad Stadium. Salah got the ball rolling with a deflected strike in the 14th minute and then teed up the impressive Dominik Szoboszlai to score before half-time. City, without the injured Erling Haaland, had their moments, but never truly came close to a comeback as Liverpool claimed their first league win Man City since 2015. Liverpool are now 11 points clear of Arsenal, who lost to West Ham United on Saturday, albeit having played a match more, while City stay in fourth. Szoboszlai’s clever flick from the resulting set-piece fell to Salah, whose first-time strike deflected in off Nathan Ake. Omar Marmoush saw an excellent finish rightly flagged offside, but Liverpool were 2-0 up in the 37th minute – Salah brilliantly got in behind and held off Josko Gvardiol before offloading it to Szoboszlai, who calmly slotted home. Szoboszlai looked to have turned provider for Jones to score Liverpool’s third in the 56th minute, but the Hungary international had just strayed offside, with the goal disallowed after a VAR review. Magnificent Salah leads Liverpool’s charge
Salah is still not sure of his Liverpool future, but as he heads into what might well be his final four months at the club, the 32-year-old is playing as well as he ever has. He was again integral to Liverpool’s attack. When City started brightly, it was Salah who offered the Reds’ first meaningful threat, getting away from Ake with a wicked turn of pace down the right flank. There may have been an element of good fortune about his opener, with Ake’s attempted block diverting the ball over Ederson’s dive, but Salah still had to make a sweet connection. Salah’s pace, strength and skill then caught out Gvardiol in the build-up to Liverpool’s second, which the Egyptian coolly set up with a perfectly weighted lay-off to Szoboszlai, returning the favour for his earlier assist. Not that Salah was Liverpool’s only star performer. Virgil van Dijk marshalled the defence; Jones was typically energetic in midfield and Szoboszlai matched Salah in regards to directly contributing to goals. But this is Salah’s team – he is driving the charge towards Liverpool’s second Premier League title and, given Arsenal’s injury crisis and most recent slip-up, it is difficult to see the Gunners catching up. One battle City did win on the day was between Jeremy Doku and Trent Alexander-Arnold. The Liverpool full-back was regularly beaten by Doku, who also managed to deliver some excellent crosses, but there was no natural No 9 there to gobble them up. Club reports

Joao Gomes then put Wolves ahead five minutes later, but they were denied a vital win by Palace skipper Marc Guehi. He was alive to convert at the back post after Daniel Munoz flicked on a corner, keeping Palace four points clear of Wolves in 17th. Dean Henderson then denied Pablo Sarabia twice either side of half-time, diving at the Spaniard’s feet and later taking his shot in the face after good work from Matheus Cunha. However, after Ismaila Sarr then squandered two golden chances to extend Palace’s lead, Chalobah missed Santiago Bueno’s searching pass, allowing Cunha to square for Larsen to finish. Wolves completed the turnaround after five further minutes as substitute Goncalo Guedes teed up Gomes to find the bottom-right corner, but there was to be a twist in the tale. O’Neil rues defensive errors
The story of Wolves’ season so far has largely been one of defensive errors. Only once have Wolves ever gone more games without a win to start a top-flight campaign, failing to win any of their first 14 matches in 1983-84. Mixed emotions for Palace
Having been a goal down with just 13 minutes remaining, with Wolves buoyant after turning the game on its head in five second-half minutes, Palace might on one hand be glad to leave Molineux with a point. They then thought they had won it in stoppage time, only for Wolves to receive a huge reprieve. Club reports

381,381,crystal-palace,2024-11-02,"Wolverhampton Wanderers’ wait for a first win of the Premier League season continued as they were pegged back in an entertaining 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace at Molineux. Trevoh Chalobah put Palace ahead on the hour mark, only for his error to allow Jorgen Strand Larsen in for a 67th-minute equaliser. Joao Gomes then put Wolves ahead five minutes later, but they were denied a vital win by Palace skipper Marc Guehi. He was alive to convert at the back post after Daniel Munoz flicked on a corner, keeping Palace four points clear of Wolves in 17th. How the match unfolded
Craig Dawson made a brilliant block to keep out Will Hughes’ attempt six minutes in, before Jean-Philippe Mateta had a glorious opportunity to put Palace ahead. But Palace hit the front on the hour mark when Larsen headed Hughes’ cross away from his goalkeeper Jose Sa, allowing Chalobah to drill into an unguarded net from an angle. However, after Ismaila Sarr then squandered two golden chances to extend Palace’s lead, Chalobah missed Santiago Bueno’s searching pass, allowing Cunha to square for Larsen to finish. Munoz took advantage of some static set-piece defending to flick a corner through to Guehi, who tapped into an empty net, and things almost got better for Palace in stoppage time, only for Mateta to see a close-range finish chalked off for a foul on Sa. Larsen took the ball away from his own goalkeeper to give Chalobah a gaping goal for the opener, then Guehi was granted the freedom of the six-yard box to score Palace’s second. Mixed emotions for Palace
Having been a goal down with just 13 minutes remaining, with Wolves buoyant after turning the game on its head in five second-half minutes, Palace might on one hand be glad to leave Molineux with a point. However, Oliver Glasner’s men could easily have left the West Midlands with all three. The VAR confirmed Anthony Taylor’s on-field decision to disallow Mateta’s potential winner, penalising Munoz for a collision with Sa as he made a late run into the area. Club reports

382,382,liverpool,2024-12-01,"Mohamed Salah scored one and created another as Liverpool marched 11 points clear of Manchester City with a 2-0 victory over Pep Guardiola’s out-of-form side at Anfield. Salah, who had previously squandered a great chance to double Liverpool’s lead, made sure of the points from the penalty spot after Stefan Ortega had fouled Luis Diaz. The Egyptian star created Liverpool’s early opener, picking out Cody Gakpo with a superb low cross. Liverpool’s dominance rarely looked under threat as they also struck the woodwork twice in the first half, with Kevin De Bruyne failing to convert from City’s best opportunity as the visitors lost a fourth straight league match. Arne Slot’s side are now nine points clear at the top of the Premier League, while City are in fifth, with their hopes of retaining the title swiftly fading away. How the match unfolded
Dominik Szoboszlai’s early long-range strike was pushed away by Ortega as Liverpool set the tone for a brilliant display, and City’s goalkeeper – in for Ederson – then got a fingertip to Virgil van Dijk’s thumping header, nudging it onto a post. Yet, less than a minute later, Gakpo found the breakthrough, darting to the far post to guide Salah’s brilliant cross over the line. Van Dijk headed just wide with another free header shortly after, while Trent Alexander-Arnold also skimmed the post with a drilled effort from the edge of the box. Salah looked certain to double their lead 56 minutes in, profiting from a loose Bernardo Silva pass as he surged in behind, but one-v-one against Ortega, he lifted it over the crossbar. Yet Liverpool got the second goal their performance merited in the 78th minute. Salah slotted home from the spot after Diaz was clattered into by Ortega, with the penalty confirmed following a VAR check. De Bruyne might have made matters interesting late on after robbing Van Dijk of possession, but Caoimhin Kelleher smothered the Belgian’s shot to cap a fantastic day for the Reds. Things keep getting better for Slot
Although there is still plenty of the season left to play, there was a feeling that a win for Liverpool could put the title out of City’s reach already, and the Reds certainly made a statement, even if the four-time reigning champions cannot be discounted too soon. Liverpool started furiously, with Ortega forced into some great saves as the visitors struggled to cope with the pace. Van Dijk may also feel slightly disappointed he did not add to Gakpo’s 12th-minute effort as he continuously caused chaos from corners, but he also did his duty at the other end as he seemed to get on the end of every ball City put into the box. Even when the Dutchman made an error late on, his goalkeeper was there to bail him and Liverpool out. Though he had earlier missed the chance to put Liverpool out of sight, Salah – who failed to convert a penalty against Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League in midweek – held his nerve from the spot to put the result to bed. A nine-point gap at the top of the table is not quite an unassailable lead at the start of December, but Liverpool have now beaten Madrid and Man City in the space of four days at Anfield, as the Slot revolution picks up further momentum. However, City struggled to match Liverpool’s early intensity as their disjointed defence was exposed and they were indebted to their goalkeeper, who kept them in the game as they failed to show any real threat at the other end of the pitch. City steadied the ship somewhat in the second half without showing any real threat to Liverpool’s steely defence, bar that late chance for De Bruyne, much to the home fans’ enjoyment. Club reports

City’s slump goes on
These are unprecedented times for City and Guardiola, who insisted he needed to prove himself after signing his new contract despite his remarkable success with the club. City threw away a three-goal lead against Feyenoord in midweek and they went into Sunday’s match as firm underdogs. Guardiola shook things up in an attempt to get a much-needed win, bringing in Ortega to replace Ederson, while he also welcomed back Ruben Dias from injury. However, City struggled to match Liverpool’s early intensity as their disjointed defence was exposed and they were indebted to their goalkeeper, who kept them in the game as they failed to show any real threat at the other end of the pitch. City steadied the ship somewhat in the second half without showing any real threat to Liverpool’s steely defence, bar that late chance for De Bruyne, much to the home fans’ enjoyment. Guardiola gave both sets of supporters a reminder of City’s recent dominance, holding up six fingers to the crowd at full time - one for each Premier League title he has won - but for this to be City’s season, they will need a minor miracle.

384,384,tottenham-hotspur,2024-12-01,"Fulham earned a deserved point in a 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur as substitute Tom Cairney scored a second-half equaliser before being sent off late on. Brennan Johnson smashed home his sixth Premier League goal of the season in the 54th minute to hand the hosts the lead after being picked out by Timo Werner at the far post. The draw means Spurs are seventh in the table, with 20 points from 13 matches, while Fulham are a point back in 10th. How the match unfolded
Fulham almost found themselves behind inside a minute when Calvin Bassey’s loose pass was gathered by Werner, but Bernd Leno was on hand to thwart Son Heung-min from close range. Iwobi gathered the ball after a counter-attack but his strike rattled the crossbar, while James Maddison’s clever free-kick under the wall clipped a post in first-half stoppage time. Despite not being at their best, Spurs took the lead through Johnson, who finished confidently beyond Leno inside the box, only to see their lead wiped out through substitute Cairney’s well-taken effort. Points dropped or point gained for Spurs? 
Despite dropping points at home this latest result may be a point gained for Spurs rather than one dropped. Without Dominic Solanke after the England international fell ill before kick-off, Son led the line and had two fantastic opportunities to open the scoring but was denied twice by Leno, before the visiting goalkeeper tipped Radu Dragusin’s header over the crossbar. Maddison’s free-kick was the closest Spurs came to opening the scoring before Johnson’s strike after the break, with the Welshman's goal coming came against the run of play. Cairney’s equaliser had been coming, with Spurs thankful for stand-in goalkeeper Forster who made several saves before the equaliser as he impressed while starting in place of the injured Guglielmo Vicario. Spurs could have fallen behind in second-half stoppage time had it not been for Dragusin’s timely interception from Harry Wilson’s cross. Spurs will be hoping to get their top-four chase back on track on Thursday but face a tough test against AFCBournemouth, who put four past  Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. While Spurs dominated the possession in the opening exchanges, it was Fulham who created the better chances, with Jimenez heading Sasa Lukic’s corner narrowly wide before the Mexican’s heavy touch in the box allowed Forster the opportunity to save. Fulham continued to frustrate their opponents after the break but were unable to find the telling touch as Issa Diop, Iwobi and Jimenez spurned some glorious opportunities before Johnson hammered the hosts in front. However, Marco Silva’s substitutions just after the hour-mark proved fruitful, with Cairney netting the equaliser, and Fulham could have won it when Wilson’s cross was brilliantly cleared by Dragusin. Brennan Johnson has scored 10 goals across all competitionsthis season, with only Erling Haaland (17), Mo Salah (12) and Christopher Nkunku (11) netting more among Premier League players. All 10 of Johnson’s have been non-penalty goals, with only Haaland netting more such strikes (15) amongst English-top-flight players. In this match, Fraser Forster (36y 259d) became the oldest player to make a Premier League appearance for Spurs since Brad Friedel (42y 176d) in November 2013.",Spurs_2024-12-01,fulham,ange-postecoglou,marco-silva,1,1,13,3,1,51,0.78,2,8,5,7,4,493,16,14,0,0,3,1,3,2,4,4,1,1,16,3,1,427,19,66,13,0,50,9,33,12,3,16,9,53,23,0,5,0.6601,2,1,5,49,1.58,3,14,2,11,14,454,16,4,1,1,6,1,4,4,12,2,3,1,36,1,1,383,15,52,32,0,50,6,30,15,11,16,14,59,22,1,2,0.0513,0,1,5

But Fulham dragged themselves level through substitute Cairney, who curled a stunning left-footed effort beyond the grasp of Fraser Forster 13 minutes later, five minutes after coming off the bench. The draw means Spurs are seventh in the table, with 20 points from 13 matches, while Fulham are a point back in 10th. How the match unfolded
Fulham almost found themselves behind inside a minute when Calvin Bassey’s loose pass was gathered by Werner, but Bernd Leno was on hand to thwart Son Heung-min from close range. Forster was then needed at the other end to smother at the feet of Raul Jimenez after he was picked out brilliantly by Alex Iwobi, before both sides struck the woodwork at the end of the first half. Iwobi gathered the ball after a counter-attack but his strike rattled the crossbar, while James Maddison’s clever free-kick under the wall clipped a post in first-half stoppage time. Despite not being at their best, Spurs took the lead through Johnson, who finished confidently beyond Leno inside the box, only to see their lead wiped out through substitute Cairney’s well-taken effort. But the Fulham captain was given his marching orders seven minutes from time for a poor challenge on Kulusevski. Without Dominic Solanke after the England international fell ill before kick-off, Son led the line and had two fantastic opportunities to open the scoring but was denied twice by Leno, before the visiting goalkeeper tipped Radu Dragusin’s header over the crossbar. Spurs could have fallen behind in second-half stoppage time had it not been for Dragusin’s timely interception from Harry Wilson’s cross. Fulham deserve their point 
Fulham bounced back from their disappointing defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers last time out with an impressive away display that perhaps warranted more than a point. While Spurs dominated the possession in the opening exchanges, it was Fulham who created the better chances, with Jimenez heading Sasa Lukic’s corner narrowly wide before the Mexican’s heavy touch in the box allowed Forster the opportunity to save. The visitors continued to threaten throughout the first half, with Kenny Tete’s inviting delivery finding Jimenez, who saw his effort brilliantly saved by Forster once again, shortly followed by Iwobi’s crisp strike that cannoned off the crossbar to close out the first 45 minutes. Fulham continued to frustrate their opponents after the break but were unable to find the telling touch as Issa Diop, Iwobi and Jimenez spurned some glorious opportunities before Johnson hammered the hosts in front. However, Marco Silva’s substitutions just after the hour-mark proved fruitful, with Cairney netting the equaliser, and Fulham could have won it when Wilson’s cross was brilliantly cleared by Dragusin.

386,386,southampton,2024-11-02,"Adam Armstrong’s late goal gave Southampton their first Premier League win of the season as they beat Everton 1-0 at St Mary’s Stadium. Aaron Ramsdale had earlier kept the scores level with a fine save from Michael Keane’s close-range header, while Everton thought they had an equaliser when Beto raced in behind and finished brilliantly beyond Southampton’s goalkeeper. Southampton’s win takes them onto four points and, at least temporarily, into 19th place, while Everton remain in 16th after their five-match unbeaten run came to an end. Beto’s introduction around the hour-mark helped Everton stretch Southampton’s defence, although it was defender Keane who almost broke the deadlock when he connected with a diving header at the back post, only to be denied by an excellent stop from Ramsdale, who tipped the ball onto the post and stopped it from trickling over the line. Southampton had the crossbar to thank when Beto clattered a header against it, and Russell Martin's side made their fortune count, racing up the other end, with Armstrong sweeping home from Yukinari Sugawara’s cutback just 25 seconds later. Winless run comes to a halt
Southampton started Armstrong as well as Archer, which on the face looked to be a more ambitious approach from Martin in the hunt for their first three points of the season. Yet Saints struggled to manufacture many clear-cut chances, especially in the first half and had to wait until the dying embers of the half to even register a shot, which was scuffed wide by Archer. But when their biggest chance came, Armstrong - who scored his first Premier League goal for Southampton against Everton back in the 2021/22 season - made sure to take it. It is a huge relief for Southampton, who have a big game against fellow strugglers Wolverhampton Wanderers next week. Dyche’s decision to take off Iliman Ndiaye did not seem to be welcomed by the away supporters, and after Southampton took the lead, he again resorted to playing centre-back Keane up front. What will concern Dyche, too, is the space that Armstrong had to convert Southampton’s winner. Club reports

387,387,everton,2024-11-02,"Adam Armstrong’s late goal gave Southampton their first Premier League win of the season as they beat Everton 1-0 at St Mary’s Stadium. Armstrong’s first league strike of the campaign came after 85 minutes of Saturday’s tightly fought contest, moments after Everton substitute Beto struck the crossbar at the other end. Aaron Ramsdale had earlier kept the scores level with a fine save from Michael Keane’s close-range header, while Everton thought they had an equaliser when Beto raced in behind and finished brilliantly beyond Southampton’s goalkeeper. Southampton’s win takes them onto four points and, at least temporarily, into 19th place, while Everton remain in 16th after their five-match unbeaten run came to an end. How the match unfolded
A quiet opening half saw two half-decent openings, one for each side - Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin was blocked off by Taylor Harwood-Bellis in the penalty area early on, while Cameron Archer dragged wide on the counter at the other end moments before the break. Beto’s introduction around the hour-mark helped Everton stretch Southampton’s defence, although it was defender Keane who almost broke the deadlock when he connected with a diving header at the back post, only to be denied by an excellent stop from Ramsdale, who tipped the ball onto the post and stopped it from trickling over the line. Beto seemed to have dragged Everton level when he latched onto James Tarkowski’s pass and finished coolly, yet the forward had just gone too soon. But when their biggest chance came, Armstrong - who scored his first Premier League goal for Southampton against Everton back in the 2021/22 season - made sure to take it. Everton lack bite
Beto spared Everton’s blushes against Fulham last week, and it looked as though he had done it again with that excellent finish in the closing stages on Saturday. This time, though, there was to be no reprieve for Sean Dyche’s team. Dyche’s decision to take off Iliman Ndiaye did not seem to be welcomed by the away supporters, and after Southampton took the lead, he again resorted to playing centre-back Keane up front. While Beto delivered another positive cameo, Everton need to show more than they are doing if they are to put distance between themselves and the relegation zone. What will concern Dyche, too, is the space that Armstrong had to convert Southampton’s winner. The striker was left alone in the box with Everton’s defenders backing off, and the Toffees duly came unstuck. Club reports

388,388,aston-villa,2025-02-22,"Marco Asensio scored his first Premier League goals as Aston Villa came from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1 on Saturday. Asensio dragged Villa level just before the hour at Villa Park, with his goal given by the referee after a VAR review deemed the original call of offside was incorrect. Ollie Watkins was twice denied at the other end, first by Jorgensen, then by Marc Cucurella, though Unai Emery decided Marcus Rashford was required to add some fresh impetus from the bench for the second half. Palmer had a glorious chance to restore Chelsea’s lead when he raced in behind but, after getting the ball stuck under his feet, his effort was blocked by the backtracking Ezri Konsa, paving the way for Asensio to settle the contest in dramatic fashion. Rashford makes his mark
Asensio took the headlines with his brace, but Rashford was just as integral to Villa’s comeback, playing a key role in both goals. He now has a big chance to shine at Villa, though, both domestically and in the UEFA Champions League. Though he had to settle for a place on the bench initially, Rashford ensured he repaid Emery’s decision to throw him in. Next up for Villa is a trip to Crystal Palace on Tuesday. Chelsea’s goalkeeper conundrum causes issues
Robert Sanchez’s loss of form has seen Maresca make the change and bring in Jorgensen over recent weeks, with the Dane – signed from Villarreal last year – starting Chelsea’s last three league matches. He could do little about Villa’s equaliser, but had earlier stood tall to make a decent save from Watkins, and he did extremely well to close down Malen after the Dutchman got the better of Chelsea’s defensive line.

Enzo Fernandez had put Chelsea ahead in the ninth minute, finishing from close range after fine work from Pedro Neto. Cole Palmer squandered a great chance to put Chelsea back ahead, and the Blues were made to pay as Asensio’s late winner moved them up to seventh, a point and a place behind Enzo Maresca’s team. How the match unfolded
Chelsea were dealt an early blow when Trevoh Chalobah was forced off injured after just eight minutes, but that frustration turned to jubilation when Neto burst down the right and centred for Fernandez to convert. Palmer had a glorious chance to restore Chelsea’s lead when he raced in behind but, after getting the ball stuck under his feet, his effort was blocked by the backtracking Ezri Konsa, paving the way for Asensio to settle the contest in dramatic fashion. Rashford still had work to do to send it across for Asensio, however, who likewise showed quick feet to finish, with Reece James failing to clear it off the line. Rashford crafted two more opportunities, first whipping in a delightful free-kick that caused havoc in Chelsea’s box, before he played in Donyell Malen. Chelsea’s goalkeeper conundrum causes issues
Robert Sanchez’s loss of form has seen Maresca make the change and bring in Jorgensen over recent weeks, with the Dane – signed from Villarreal last year – starting Chelsea’s last three league matches. He could do little about Villa’s equaliser, but had earlier stood tall to make a decent save from Watkins, and he did extremely well to close down Malen after the Dutchman got the better of Chelsea’s defensive line. Yet it was from the resulting set-piece that Chelsea failed to clear their lines and, ultimately, their goalkeeper cost them a share of the points. With Chelsea embroiled in a tight battle for the European places, fine margins are going to be crucial. His next task will be to get Jorgensen’s confidence up ahead of Chelsea hosting Southampton on Tuesday. Club reports

390,390,everton,2025-02-22,"Manuel Ugarte’s first Manchester United goal finished off a comeback to salvage a 2-2 draw against Everton at Goodison Park. It had looked like a comfortable afternoon for the Toffees. Bruno Fernandes pulled one back with a stunning free-kick in the second half, and almost scored a late winner, though he was denied by Jordan Pickford. Everton, meanwhile, saw a stoppage-time penalty decision overturned by the referee following a VAR review. Everton move up to 12th in the table, though remain one point above United, who stay 15th on 30 points. Jack Harrison’s low drive was parried into the air by Onana, and the Malian followed in to nod it over the line. Everton kept pushing in the second half and should have scored a third as Jake O’Brien clipped a cross into Beto, but his sweetly-hit volley was superbly saved by a stretching Onana. It took just eight more minutes for the visitors to flip the script, with Fernandes’ free-kick only headed as far as Ugarte, and his half-volley was just out of Pickford’s reach. Fernandes saw a long-range effort tipped over the bar shortly before Everton were awarded a stoppage-time penalty for a tug on Ashley Young by Harry Maguire but, after a VAR review, the on-field decision was overturned by referee Andy Madley. Everton falter late on
Everton’s resurgence under David Moyes has certainly impressed, and it looked set to continue with a win over his former club. However, while the Toffees enjoyed a late comeback against rivals Liverpool earlier this month, they found themselves on the wrong end of one this time. Beto, who made life difficult for Onana with his finish, will claim a lot of plaudits once again after becoming the first Everton player to score in four consecutive top-flight games since Richarlison in 2021. His driving run in behind cut open the United defence before he picked out Harrison, who might feel disappointed after hitting his shot straight at Onana. For 70 minutes, Everton were in cruise control. Beto and Harrison both had more chances to score, with the former’s volley their best chance of the second half, but they struggled to take advantage of United’s defence. The Everton fans were clearly aggrieved with the late penalty decision, with it deemed there was not enough contact on Young. Amorim’s first league win in charge of United was a 4-0 thrashing of Everton – then under Sean Dyche – but much of their final trip to Goodison Park could not have been further from that showing. They needed a moment of magic to get back into the game, with Fernandes’ free-kick leaving Pickford static on his line. The captain was at the heart of the comeback, having also delivered the free-kick that led to Ugarte’s superb finish, while his looping effort in the 89th minute was just tipped over the bar by Pickford.

Playing the second half with 10 men, the Hammers' woes were compounded by further goals from Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ola Aina as Forest stretched their unbeaten run to four matches. Nuno Espirito Santo's men leapfrogged Arsenal into third place in the table following the Gunners' 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United earlier on Saturday. How the match unfolded
Forest dominated the early stages, but Nuno's hosts struggled for clear-cut chances, with Hudson-Odoi dragging a close-range effort wide inside the first two minutes. Wood then showed his defensive instincts to block Lucas Paqueta's low strike on goal, before things got worse for West Ham as Alvarez was dismissed for a rash lunge on Anthony Elanga just before half-time. Lopetegui's visitors rallied after the restart, but  Forest weathered this quick burst of pressure and made their numerical advantage count. Hudson-Odoi curled in from the edge of the box after Ryan Yates found him with a quick free-kick after 65 minutes, then Aina lashed home from distance after more lax West Ham defending 12 minutes from time. The hosts almost added a fourth late on as Lukasz Fabianski produced a superb reflex stop to deny Nikola Milenkovic and Yates saw an effort ruled out for offside following a VAR review. Cool, calm and collected Callum
Wood will grab the headlines for Forest as his impressive goalscoring streak continued. However, Forest's second scorer deserves plenty of praise following a lively performance, with Hudson-Odoi netting his first home goal of the campaign. Alongside Elanga on the opposite flank, Hudson-Odoi offered the perfect blend of pace and trickery in wide areas, playing off physical focal point Wood to great effect. A touch of fortune – in the form of a slight deflection – aided him for his goal, but the confidence and calmness to take on such a chance was a testament to his development under Nuno. With Forest flying high ahead of next week's home game versus Newcastle, Hudson-Odoi continues to make good on the promise he showed as a youngster with Chelsea. Club reports

Andoni Iraola’s side came into Saturday’s match in a rich run of form, having won 12 of their last 13 Premier League games – a streak that started with a 4-2 win in the reverse fixture. Bournemouth were faced another setback against Wolves though, with Zabarnyi’s red card leaving them down to 10 men just 31 minutes in. The defender, who had played every minute of Bournemouth’s league campaign, has been key to Iraola’s defence and his absence was felt deeply. They managed to fashion a few decent chances prior to Zabarnyi’s sending-off. Sa denied an ambitious curling effort from Marcus Tavernier just three minutes in, before quickly cutting out an attempted cross from Semenyo. Bournemouth’s best opportunity came in the 17th minute, when Kluivert was slipped though by Semenyo, only to be denied once again by Sa.

How the match unfolded
Wolves almost struck in the ninth minute as Nelson Semedo surged forward, his low shot striking the woodwork before Kepa Arrizabalaga pulled off a stunning reflex save to keep out Jean-Ricner Bellegarde’s follow-up. Jose Sa made a similarly smart stop soon at the other end after Antoine Semenyo had slipped Justin Kluivert in behind, but the Wolves goalkeeper was quick off his line to smother the shot. Yet Wolves were handed a boost when Zabarnyi’s yellow card for a slide on Ait-Nouri was upgraded to a red. The visitors swiftly made their numerical advantage count – Cunha smashing beyond Kepa after the ball fell kindly for him in the area. Wolves took control after half-time, shuffling the ball past Bournemouth with relative ease. Cunha the hero – again
After nearly spurring Wolves on to fight back for a point in their last league match against Liverpool, Cunha was once again the bright spot for Pereira as the Brazilian continued his brilliant form, netting his 13th goal of the season. This could, though, prove to be his most important, as Wolves finally put some daylight between themselves and the bottom three. Cunha has been Wolves' talisman this season, and with goals in each of his last three matches, it was no surprise to see him be the key element again. A few minutes after Semedo and Bellegarde had tested Kepa early on, Cunha followed suit with a signature curling shot from distance. With an apparently kinder run of fixtures coming up, including a league encounter at Molineux against Fulham in midweek, Wolves have every reason to believe that a spot in the Premier League next season can be theirs.

And the turnaround was complete three minutes later when Mohamed Salah curled a trademark left-footed finish beyond Bart Verbruggen. With Arsenal and Manchester City losing, Liverpool are top of the pile on 25 points, two clear of their nearest challengers after the opening 10 games, while Brighton are seventh. Liverpool’s search for an equaliser was met with a flurry of saves from Verbruggen, who denied Alexis Mac Allister a goal against his former club, with Brighton having earlier gone close through Georginio Rutter and Danny Welbeck. But two goals in just 128 seconds turned the match on its head, with Gakpo’s attempted cross going all the way through to draw the Reds level. Salah then powered Arne Slot’s side in front, capping off a sweeping move as Liverpool turned defence into attack. Curtis Jones supplied the pass out to the Egyptian, who set himself on his stronger foot and bent a sublime effort into the left-hand corner to delight the Anfield faithful and send the Reds top. Slot’s comeback kings
Liverpool made a name of being the comeback kings under Jurgen Klopp, but their inspired second-half turnaround proved Slot has mastered those powers of recovery too. Mac Allister’s header, that was saved by Verbruggen, was a sign of their intent, with Virgil van Dijk squandering a golden chance moments later after being picked out by Trent Alexander-Arnold’s delivery – the Dutchman unable to find the desired connection. Luis Diaz’s introduction provided the spark that was missing in the final third, and his impact helped pave the way for Gakpo and Salah to take centre stage. Slot’s latest result could be his biggest, given the results around them, though there were worrying signs that he will look to rectify before Liverpool welcome former favourite Xabi Alonso and Bayer Leverkusen in the UEFA Champions League next week. Against another side Brighton may have got away with their wastefulness, but the Reds’ ruthless streak eventually shone through. Verbruggen was on hand to deny Salah’s attempted flick early in the second half after the Liverpool star was played through by Nunez, but he was powerless in stopping the two goals that won the game for the hosts. While still in the infancy of his tenure, this was Fabian Hurzeler’s first Anfield experience. Club reports

Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee both scored twice to ensure the Portuguese continued his unbeaten start to life at Old Trafford, having drawn at Ipswich Town last time out in his first match in charge. Rashford scored the first goal of the Amorim era last weekend and opened the scoring again here, netting after 34 minutes before adding his second shortly after the second half kicked off. Following the result, United move up to ninth on 19 points, while Everton remain in 15th, two points above the relegation zone. How the match unfolded
After wasting a couple of half-chances early on, Beto almost broke the deadlock when he rounded Andre Onana, only to fire his low shot into the side-netting from a tight angle. Later in the first half, Rashford met Bruno Fernandes’ corner on the volley, and Jarrad Branthwaite deflected it into the net. The defender was then caught out again for United’s second, as Amad nicked the ball off his toe, and Fernandes unselfishly squared it across the box for Zirkzee to fire home. It took just 20 seconds for the hosts to add a third after the restart, Amad coolly threading it through for Rashford, who beat Jordan Pickford at his near post with a powerful low shot. Dominic Calvert-Lewin almost grabbed a late consolation for Everton, but Onana pushed his header away from the near post. United click into gear
While United did not make a similarly quick start as they had done last weekend, they nevertheless enjoyed a comfortable first Premier League home game under Amorim. Things started to gel before the break, though, as Fernandes found his range and the front line started to flow. Rashford’s opening goal came at the perfect time, injecting confidence into the hosts, and he did not look back after that. Another clean sheet is also a welcome boost to United as they welcome defenders back from long-term injuries. That will come just in time as bookings for Lisandro Martinez and Kobbie Mainoo here will see them miss their trip to Arsenal on Wednesday in Amorim’s biggest test since stepping into the dugout. McNeil breezed through United’s midfield in the opening exchanges and picked up promising positions, but with no end product in sight, they could not make the danger count. Calvert-Lewin was introduced with 25 minutes left, albeit with Everton already 4-0 down, and only a brilliant save from Onana kept him off the scoresheet. Perhaps more worrying to Dyche will be the ease with which United picked them apart for the four goals, with defensive errors leading to two of those after their recent solidity at the back, something he will be hoping is simply a blip.

399,399,everton,2024-12-01,"Ruben Amorim claimed his first Premier League win in charge of Manchester United with a 4-0 victory over Everton on Sunday. Following the result, United move up to ninth on 19 points, while Everton remain in 15th, two points above the relegation zone. Later in the first half, Rashford met Bruno Fernandes’ corner on the volley, and Jarrad Branthwaite deflected it into the net. It took just 20 seconds for the hosts to add a third after the restart, Amad coolly threading it through for Rashford, who beat Jordan Pickford at his near post with a powerful low shot. As Everton pushed bodies forward in search of a goal, they were caught out by a blistering counter-attack, with Amad dispossessing James Tarkowski to tee up Zirkzee for his second. Dominic Calvert-Lewin almost grabbed a late consolation for Everton, but Onana pushed his header away from the near post. In their new 3-4-3 formation, the hosts initially struggled against Everton, who looked comfortable in midfield thanks to Dwight McNeil’s composure. Everton left with questions to answer
Everton’s defensive record in recent games has been something to admire, but Sean Dyche was left with more questions at both ends of the pitch as his side drew another blank. It has been four matches and over a month since the Toffees last celebrated a goal, a dilemma which the manager attempted to address by starting Beto ahead of Calvert-Lewin, a move that looked like it might pay off. McNeil breezed through United’s midfield in the opening exchanges and picked up promising positions, but with no end product in sight, they could not make the danger count. Calvert-Lewin was introduced with 25 minutes left, albeit with Everton already 4-0 down, and only a brilliant save from Onana kept him off the scoresheet.

Following Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday, Mikel Arteta's team had the opportunity to go five points behind Arne Slot's side, who visit Manchester City on Sunday. However, Arsenal struggled to carve out chances against a well-drilled West Ham defence at Emirates Stadium and were punished when Jarrod Bowen nodded Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross home just before half-time. Deprived of attacking options, Arsenal’s hopes were dented further when substitute Myles Lewis-Skelly was sent off in the 73rd minute. They stay 16th, 13 points clear of the relegation zone, while Arsenal could find themselves 11 points behind Liverpool by the end of the weekend. How the match unfolded
West Ham frustrated Arsenal throughout the first half, with Mikel Merino, starting up front, prodding wide when presented with the Gunners' best chance of the first 45 minutes. But Arsenal failed to heed those warnings and fell behind in the 44th minute. Wan-Bissaka burst forward to cross for the unmarked Bowen to nod in. But Arsenal's hopes of a comeback suffered a massive blow when Lewis-Skelly lost possession to Mohammed Kudus and immediately chopped him down, with referee Craig Pawson upgrading the punishment from a yellow card to a red after a VAR review. A wayward stoppage-time shot from White was the closest Arsenal came to an equaliser, as they handed Liverpool the initiative at the top. Gunners fire costly blank
Much of the talk before this game centred on Arsenal's selection dilemma up front. Having lost Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus to injury, Arteta deployed Merino as a makeshift striker from the bench at Leicester City last week and was rewarded with a match-winning brace from the Spain international. After that half-chance, Merino was starved of service as West Ham set up a wall of black shirts on the edge of their area, with Arsenal's attempts to pick the lock growing increasingly desperate. When Bowen started the counter-attack that culminated in his 44th-minute goal, all 10 Arsenal outfielders were within 30 yards of Areola's goal, giving West Ham acres of space to exploit on the break. Arsenal now need a huge favour from Man City on Sunday, before they face a tricky trip to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday. West Ham also switched to a 3-5-2 system, a change which proved inspired as the well-drilled visitors denied Arsenal any space in central areas. Arsenal left-back Riccardo Calafiori looked to provide the Gunners with an extra body in attack, but the space he left in behind was ruthlessly exploited by Wan-Bissaka, who motored down the right before supplying a pinpoint cross for Bowen to score.

West Ham frustrated Arsenal throughout the first half, with Mikel Merino, starting up front, prodding wide when presented with the Gunners' best chance of the first 45 minutes. At the other end, Tomas Soucek twice headed over from near the penalty spot either side of Bowen sending a rushed effort trickling wide. Wan-Bissaka burst forward to cross for the unmarked Bowen to nod in. Bowen was inches away from turning Aaron Cresswell's cross home as West Ham continued to threaten after the break, before Leandro Trossard finally worked Alphonse Areola with a low drive.

Potter works his magic
Graham Potter's first league game in charge of West Ham ended in a 3-2 victory over Fulham in mid-January, but a return of one point from their next four games had dampened any enthusiasm at the London Stadium. West Ham also switched to a 3-5-2 system, a change which proved inspired as the well-drilled visitors denied Arsenal any space in central areas. Arsenal left-back Riccardo Calafiori looked to provide the Gunners with an extra body in attack, but the space he left in behind was ruthlessly exploited by Wan-Bissaka, who motored down the right before supplying a pinpoint cross for Bowen to score.

402,402,chelsea,2024-12-01,"Cole Palmer’s sublime strike capped off a fantastic 3-0 win for Chelsea over Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. With second-place Arsenal winning on Saturday, Chelsea took the chance to keep the pressure on the Gunners and moved – at least temporarily – above Manchester City in the process. Nicolas Jackson opened the scoring with his eighth league goal of the season when he tucked away Marc Cucurella’s centre. Enzo Fernandez doubled Chelsea’s lead before half-time, while Palmer’s superb 20-yard finish put the result beyond doubt in the 83rd minute. Enzo Maresca’s side are in third place, level on points with Arsenal, while Villa slip to 12th having failed to win any of their last five Premier League matches. How the match unfolded
Chelsea broke through after just seven minutes. Cucurella dispossessed Jaden Philogene and exchanged passes with Jadon Sancho, before the Spaniard’s cross was turned in by Jackson at the near post. Villa saw a golden opportunity to level go begging when Ollie Watkins, after showing his strength to regain possession on the edge of Chelsea’s box, shot straight at Robert Sanchez from close range. Some haphazard goalkeeping from Emiliano Martinez handed Chelsea a pair of good chances for a second goal, but they were not taken. However, the Blues did double their advantage in the 36th minute, Fernandez prodding into the bottom-right corner after combining with Palmer. However, Villa’s comeback hopes were all but extinguished when Palmer curled a wonderful effort into the top-left corner, giving Martinez’s replacement Robin Olsen little chance and compounding a miserable day for Unai Emery’s team. Maresca momentum continues
Chelsea were quick out of the blocks, with their fast start spearheaded by Jackson, who scored an opening goal for the sixth time in the Premier League this season. Palmer had never previously assisted or scored a goal against Villa in the league, but he soon put that right by firing a pass into the feet of Fernandez, who finished brilliantly. The England star then wrapped up the victory in magnificent fashion later on, scoring his 30th Premier League goal for the Blues in the process. Chelsea’s momentum under Maresca is showing no signs of slowing down. Chelsea are fully firing under Maresca, whose fluid attacking style is well-suited to the Blues’ youthful squad. Fernandez is getting forward from his deep midfield role, and Jackson is proving a constant threat. Villa found wanting
Travelling to Stamford Bridge without a victory in seven matches across all competitions, getting back to winning ways on Sunday was always going to be a tricky task for Villa. While the in-form Jackson confidently finished at one end, Watkins’ recent run of poor form was evident as he shot straight at Sanchez at the other. Not long after giving away an indirect free-kick, which Palmer was unable to convert, Villa’s No 1 played a pass across his own penalty area straight to Jackson, whose delayed reaction to the unexpected opportunity enabled the goalkeeper to lunge in and spare his own blushes. And they were completely helpless when Palmer waved his wand of a left foot to put the seal on a commanding Chelsea victory. Club reports

404,404,leicester-city,2024-12-03,"Ruud van Nistelrooy made an immediate impression in his first match as Leicester City manager as the Foxes beat fellow Premier League strugglers West Ham United 3-1 at King Power Stadium. Jamie Vardy needed only two minutes to fire Leicester ahead, with his opener initially ruled out for offside before a VAR review confirmed that the goal should be awarded. West Ham then started to dominate but could not take their chances, hitting the woodwork through Danny Ings before Tomas Soucek's foul on Mads Hermansen led to a potential second-half equaliser being disallowed. Having teed up Vardy's opener, Bilal El Khannouss extended Leicester's advantage with a cool finish just after the hour mark, before substitute Patson Daka added a third in the 90th minute. Leicester's first win in six, meanwhile, sees them climb to 15th, four points clear of the relegation zone. How the match unfolded
The Van Nistelrooy era had immediate lift-off when El Khannouss found Vardy, who was played onside by Konstantinos Mavropanos before he calmly rolled into the bottom-right corner. West Ham should have responded before the half-hour mark as Ings' header cannoned against Hermansen's right-hand post, while Soucek nodded narrowly wide. Lopetegui's side thought they had levelled prior to the hour, but the VAR concurred with Joshua Smith's on-field call that Soucek had fouled Hermansen when challenging for Crysencio Summerville's hopeful hook, as the ball was bundled over the goal line. That incident proved pivotal moments later when El Khannouss steered into the bottom corner, before Daka thrashed home a third to make sure of Leicester's victory. Van Nistelrooy gives Leicester reason to believe
Van Nistelrooy impressed his new employers with two victories over them as Manchester United's interim manager recently, enjoying a four-match unbeaten run before Ruben Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford. Former Foxes boss Enzo Maresca - now of Chelsea - encouraged his friend and old team-mate to make the move after his United spell, though the differences in their two styles was notable from the off on Tuesday. Van Nistelrooy's front-footed aggression was clear to see immediately as Vardy profited from Mavropanos's slack positioning to score, the striker also being denied a second goal by Lukasz Fabianski soon afterwards. Leicester were far from convincing in defence at times, with Hermansen required on numerous occasions, though their counter-attacking prowess proved too much for West Ham. Yet there would be no denying Daka as the Leicester substitute was set free by Victor Kristiansen's long ball before dropping his shoulder and hammering past Fabianski. Van Nistelrooy will be keen to work on those attacking positives, while offering further protection to Hermansen's goal, ahead of their home match with Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday. Disappointment proved to be the flavour of this performance too, as Vardy twice escaped Lopetegui's high line early on and set the tone for another worrying showing. Captain Bowen aimed to drag his side back into it, twice drawing fine stops from Hermansen either side of setting up a gilt-edged headed chance for Ings. Mohammed Kudus's delivery from the other wing teed up a glorious Soucek opportunity, before Bowen's first-time effort from Vladimir Coufal's cross was again parried well by Hermansen. Substitute Summerville almost created a leveller after his half-time introduction, but was thwarted by Soucek's foul on Hermansen, then the former Leeds United winger saw an effort cleared off the line by Conor Coady.

That painted a familiar and frustrating story for West Ham, as their failure to take their chances came back to haunt them late on. Their misfiring attack simply must improve before hosting Wolverhampton Wanderers on Monday, with Lopetegui desperately needing a result against his former club. Club reports

With their efforts to qualify for Europe very much alive after consecutive league wins against Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, Fulham fluffed their lines on an afternoon when another three points was attainable. Marco Silva's side were too easily put off by decisions going against them in the first half and became rattled as Palace took the upper hand, taking just three shots in the opening 45 minutes. Smith Rowe and substitute Tom Cairney hobbled off injured, while Alex Iwobi was kept very quiet as the hosts created virtually nothing against their resilient visitors. Having seemingly put a rough patch behind them, it feels like one step forward and another back for Silva, whose side must quickly improve to stay in the hunt for Europe.

Plenty of credit must go to Palace for turning this into a surprisingly one-sided game. He also teamed up nicely with Eze, who looked back to his best further up the pitch. The England international has missed Palace's last three matches and it was no surprise his team improved upon his return, with his twinkle-toes lighting up Craven Cottage, particularly in the first half. He was also denied what would have been a memorable assist when Mateta was fractionally offside from his backheel but it mattered not as his side comfortably saw out an impressive win. Palace now have a huge cushion over the top three and look set to be able to enjoy the run-in to their campaign. Up next for them is Aston Villa at Selhurst Park on Tuesday. Club reports

408,408,ipswich-town,2025-02-22,"Brennan Johnson scored twice as a resurgent Tottenham Hotspur made it three successive Premier League wins with a 4-1 victory at Ipswich Town. The Wales international, whose father David played for the Tractor Boys between 1997 and 2001, bagged a first-half double, while Djed Spence and Dejan Kulusevski were each on target late on to seal victory at Portman Road. Johnson was in the right place at the right time twice in the space of eight minutes to convert a pair of Son Heung-min assists, though Omari Hutchinson halved the deficit before the break with an impressive goal for the hosts. The result remained in the balance until the closing stages, when a deflected Spence shot and Kulusevski’s fine individual goal ultimately condemned Ipswich to a seventh defeat in eight home league matches. Kieran McKenna’s side remain 18th, but they are now five points from safety following Wolverhampton Wanderers’ surprise win at AFC Bournemouth. Ipswich may have felt hard done by to be two goals behind and they halved the deficit in the 36th minute when Kalvin Phillips stole possession and fed Jack Clarke, who cut the ball back for Hutchinson to sweep a brilliant first-time finish beyond Guglielmo Vicario. Spurs restored their two-goal lead in the 77th minute when Ipswich substitute Luke Woolfenden, who had a header ruled out for offside earlier on, deflected Spence’s shot beyond helpless home goalkeeper Alex Palmer after the Spurs full-back had been cleverly found by James Maddison. Ipswich's lack of home comfort continues
The only side yet to record a Premier League victory in 2025, Ipswich had been buoyed by their hard-earned 1-1 draw at Villa Park last weekend. But despite their promising start, Ipswich switched off at the other end, affording Son too much space down the left to tee up Johnson for both goals, from which point a costly defeat always looked likely. To their credit, the hosts recovered well – aided by Hutchinson’s well-taken goal – and finished the first half strongly, while carrying the greater attacking threat for large periods after the break as well. Ipswich’s bid to avoid the drop has not been helped by their home form. Since their only league win at Portman Road this season, against Chelsea in December, they have lost four matches in a row in front of their own fans by an aggregate score of 14-2. Ipswich are away to another under-pressure team in desperate need of momentum, Manchester United, on Wednesday. Johnson haunts father’s former club
Around this time 25 years ago, David Johnson’s goals were instrumental towards Ipswich sealing their return to the Premier League. Given their knack of surrendering points from winning positions this season, Spurs will not have been sitting comfortably after Hutchinson halved the deficit and Woolfenden’s headed goal was disallowed. Spurs then ensured any faint hopes Ipswich may have had of mounting a dramatic fightback were firmly dashed, as Kulusevski sent a delicious effort beyond the dive of Palmer, giving Spurs a third straight league win for the first time since December 2023.

Spurs remain 12th, six points adrift of the top 10. How the match unfolded
In a relatively even opening half, it was Spurs who struck first in the 18th minute. Son latched on to a long ball over the top of the hosts’ defence down the left and made good ground before laying it on a plate for Johnson to tap in from close range. The same two players combined as the visitors doubled their lead, with Son again being found in space before he centred the ball for Johnson to apply the finishing touch with a low finish. Ipswich may have felt hard done by to be two goals behind and they halved the deficit in the 36th minute when Kalvin Phillips stole possession and fed Jack Clarke, who cut the ball back for Hutchinson to sweep a brilliant first-time finish beyond Guglielmo Vicario.

Around this time 25 years ago, David Johnson’s goals were instrumental towards Ipswich sealing their return to the Premier League. But a quarter of a century later, his son Brennan’s goals have dented their hopes of remaining in the top flight. After breaking the deadlock with a tap-in on the line, Johnson doubled his and Spurs’ tally with a neat first-time finish. Given their knack of surrendering points from winning positions this season, Spurs will not have been sitting comfortably after Hutchinson halved the deficit and Woolfenden’s headed goal was disallowed. Spurs then ensured any faint hopes Ipswich may have had of mounting a dramatic fightback were firmly dashed, as Kulusevski sent a delicious effort beyond the dive of Palmer, giving Spurs a third straight league win for the first time since December 2023.

Ipswich missed the chance to move out of the relegation zone and remain in 18th place on five points, five fewer than Leicester in 15th. How the match unfolded
Leicester carried the greater threat early on with Abdul Fatawu and Facundo Buonanotte both calling Arijanet Muric into action, while Conor Chaplin and Ben Johnson went close from distance at the other end as Ipswich grew into the contest. The hosts broke through 10 minutes after the restart with Sam Morsy’s crossfield ball brilliantly converted by Davis from a tight angle. Ipswich were forced to increase their concentration levels when Phillips was shown his second yellow card for a late challenge on Ricardo Pereira. Ipswich’s wait goes on
It looked like Ipswich could finally end their 22-and-a-half year wait for that elusive Premier League victory. Davis seemed set to be the hero at Portman Road, as the full-back marked his 100th appearance for the club with a brilliantly controlled volley to break the deadlock. However, Kieran McKenna would not have been taking anything for granted. Buoyed by the home crowd, Ipswich desperately held on with Burgess doing magnificently to thwart Ayew on the line. The wait for victory goes on and with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United awaiting them in their next two games, confidence will not exactly be brimming for the Tractor Boys. Gliding into the box, he played a delightful one-two with Vardy before slotting home to silence Portman Road. Club reports

Ipswich missed the chance to move out of the relegation zone and remain in 18th place on five points, five fewer than Leicester in 15th. How the match unfolded
Leicester carried the greater threat early on with Abdul Fatawu and Facundo Buonanotte both calling Arijanet Muric into action, while Conor Chaplin and Ben Johnson went close from distance at the other end as Ipswich grew into the contest. With manager Steve Cooper watching from the stands while he served a one-game touchline ban, Leicester sought a response and Harry Winks’ curling long-range effort drew a smart reflex save from Muric. However, they could not hold on as Ayew brilliantly converted a neat one-two with Jamie Vardy to salvage a point for the visitors. Another Leicester late show
Leicester were eager to make it third time lucky having suffered back-to-back losses in all competitions. While they trailed, Leicester would not have been panicking. After all, the Foxes had recovered from 2-0 down to snatch all three points at Southampton in their last Premier League game on the road, with Ayew scoring a 98th-minute winner. Gliding into the box, he played a delightful one-two with Vardy before slotting home to silence Portman Road. With their next two matches against Man Utd and Chelsea, it was important for the Foxes to East Anglia with something. Club reports

Palace climb a place to 16th and take their tally to 12 points, which is three more than Kieran McKenna’s side, who stay 19th.

Ipswich sought an equaliser as the clock ticked down. Substitutes Ali Al-Hamadi and Nathan Broadhead could not quite connect with Greaves’ header across the area following a well-worked free-kick. Ipswich’s wait goes on
It is just under 30 years since these two sides last contested a Premier League game. Ipswich are the only side still seeking a first home win of the campaign, and they struggled to generate a decent attacking threat during the first half. Both sides appeared rejuvenated and carried greater purpose upon the restart, but Mateta’s goal knocked the Tractor Boys. But other than the opportunity involving Al-Hamadi and Broadhead, they never truly put the Palace defence under intense pressure. Palace end away drought

Most of their attacking work came on the counter and they always looked dangerous with the threat carried by Eze, Mateta and Ismaila Sarr. It was Mateta who made the difference with a well-taken goal. The goal means that he has now scored in each of his last four matches against promoted sides – only the second Palace player to achieve that, after Andy Johnson 20 years ago. Club reports

That disappointment was compounded by a second Brighton goal as Minteh nicked the ball off Joe Aribo before unselfishly squaring for Rutter to easily finish in the six-yard box.

Southampton and Ivan Juric were hoping to recapture some of the positive aspects of their second-half performance in the defeat to Bournemouth, and that was highlighted in the line-up, with Tyler Dibling and Leslie Ugochukwu handed starts after their fine displays off the bench last weekend. Dibling struggled to make an impact and Kamaldeen Sulemana, buoyed by his goal last weekend, only showed flashes of quality in the rare moments the Saints went forward.

Brighton move up to eighth in the table, a point clear of Fulham, ahead of Aston Villa’s match with Chelsea. How the match unfolded
The first chance of the match went to the away side, with Aaron Ramsdale saving Rutter’s low shot in the penalty area with an outstretched leg, as Mitoma also went close and Minteh slipped at the vital moment when being put clean through.

Ruud van Nistelrooy's team have now lost six successive Premier League matches at the King Power by an aggregate score of 15-0. Leicester showed signs of life in attack early on, with Coulibaly bustling his way into the area to test Flekken, before Vardy rolled back the years with a darting run off the back of Ethan Pinnock. But a litany of defensive errors cost the Foxes again. Norgaard was unchallenged six yards out when he scored Brentford's third, and Soumare teed up Carvalho's fourth when he attempted to clear after Hermansen parried Mbeumo’s shot. With the Dutchman under increasing pressure, Leicester visit West Ham United on Thursday, before a daunting run of fixtures pits them against Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Brighton and Liverpool.

Ten minutes later, Mbeumo doubled Brentford's lead with a curling strike from the right of the box, having been found by Damsgaard, who has now produced 10 assists this season, the most of any Brentford player in a single campaign in the competition. The Bees were in cruise control from there as Norgaard added a third when he nodded home Mbeumo's free-kick. Only a spectacular fingertip save from Mads Hermansen stopped Yehor Yarmoliuk from extending Brentford's lead in the 69th minute after the substitute glanced Mbeumo's cross goalwards. But Brentford would cap a memorable outing with another goal, Carvalho drilling home after Boubakary Soumare failed to clear following a goalmouth scramble. Leicester showed signs of life in attack early on, with Coulibaly bustling his way into the area to test Flekken, before Vardy rolled back the years with a darting run off the back of Ethan Pinnock. All that was missing was the finish as Flekken made himself big to smother the shot. Norgaard was unchallenged six yards out when he scored Brentford's third, and Soumare teed up Carvalho's fourth when he attempted to clear after Hermansen parried Mbeumo’s shot. A newly appointed Van Nistelrooy had a watching brief for November's return fixture at Brentford, which ended in a chastening 4-1 defeat, and there is little evidence of the defensive issues they displayed on that day being resolved. Bees buzzing after club record fourth away win in a row
In the early stages of 2024/25, Brentford were imperious at the Gtech Community Stadium but could not buy a victory on the road. This victory was just as comprehensive as that one, with Frank's team exerting total control after Wissa opened the scoring. Damsgaard added another assist for Mbeumo's goal to cap his lively midfield performance, taking him to 10 for the season. Nottingham Forest, AFC Bournemouth and Fulham have all been tipped to upset the established order and push for European qualification this season, but Brentford have gone under the radar. Sitting just four points adrift of the top seven and with a home game against 14th-placed Everton up next on Wednesday, perhaps the Bees can also dare to dream. Club reports

City superstar Haaland delivered a blank for the visitors and has now scored only once in his last four league outings. Haaland looked uncomfortable in the first half and appeared to be struggling with an injury. The Norwegian's limp will have worried Pep Guardiola, who is already battling a lengthy injury list. Haaland looked inhibited in his movements despite staying on for the duration. While he delivered City’s first shot on target in the 80th minute, using his strength to get in front of his marker in the box and latch onto the cross, his header was straight at 'keeper Travers. When the ball dropped to Haaland with the chance to equalise in the 93rd minute, you would usually expect it to end up in the back of the net, but his header once more fell within Travers’ reach.

After an open start, Newcastle got in front when Gordon’s cross was headed beyond David Raya by Isak. Newcastle returned after the interval with their sights set on a second, though Joe Willock could only fire over at Raya’s near post. Ethan Nwaneri was brought on to make an impact in the final third for the Gunners, but almost played a part at the wrong end when his tackle broke kindly for Isak, though his strike from distance was kept out by Raya.

Arteta’s side were tipped to challenge Manchester City once again for the Premier League title this term, though their performance against Newcastle further highlighted their recent fragilities. Alexander the Great back on form
Newcastle’s recent run in the Premier League has coincided with Isak and Gordon’s absence, but the pair combined with devastating effect to open the scoring on Saturday. Isak headed home his 12th goal in as many matches at St. James’ Park, but his task was made a simple one given the pinpoint accuracy of Gordon’s delivery. Shortly after playing a part in the opener, Gordon was again attacking the Arsenal defence, this time seeing his cross narrowly evade his team-mates with the slightest of touches. The hosts were worthy of the victory, though, and should have had more goals to show for it with Isak and Joelinton going close. Isak’s timely return to the scoresheet is a welcome boost for Newcastle, and he will be hoping to continue his run of form against Nottingham Forest next Sunday. Club reports

Arteta’s side were tipped to challenge Manchester City once again for the Premier League title this term, though their performance against Newcastle further highlighted their recent fragilities. It was an unusually blunt display from the Gunners, who managed just one shot on target during the contest, which came courtesy of Merino in the first half. Saka, Kai Havertz and Leandro Trossard all found it difficult to penetrate the hosts’ stubborn defence. While the Gunners were off-colour, they could have snatched a point at the end. Rice was picked out beautifully by Saka in second-half stoppage time but could only head his attempt wide of Nick Pope’s net. Having only lost one of their first 25 Premier League matches in 2024, Arsenal have since been beaten in two of their last three (D1). The England international proved a handful for Arsenal’s defence throughout the match. Shortly after playing a part in the opener, Gordon was again attacking the Arsenal defence, this time seeing his cross narrowly evade his team-mates with the slightest of touches.

422,422,aston-villa,2024-12-04,"Morgan Rogers’ superb goal set Aston Villa on their way to a commanding 3-1 home victory over Brentford, ending their eight-match winless streak in all competitions. Rogers, Ollie Watkins and Matty Cash were all on target in a 13-minute flurry of goals in the first half that proved decisive at Villa Park on Wednesday. An impressive victory saw Unai Emery’s side end their alarming recent run of form, which had included collecting just two points from their last five Premier League games. A long-range strike from Rogers midway through the first half broke the deadlock, and Watkins swiftly doubled the lead with a penalty kick he had won himself. How the match unfolded
Villa took the lead in spectacular fashion in the 21st minute, as Rogers exchanged passes with Watkins before whipping a delicious 20-yard effort into the top corner. The hosts doubled their advantage seven minutes later when Watkins, who was fouled by Ethan Pinnock, just about beat Mark Flekken from 12 yards, despite the Brentford goalkeeper getting a hand to his spot-kick. It was three in the 34th minute when Rogers’ cross to the far post evaded Watkins but was volleyed in from a tight angle by Cash. Flekken denied Lucas Digne and Watkins shortly after the break before Brentford pulled one back in the 54th minute, as Damsgaard fired into the roof of the net from close range. However, it was Villa who went closest to scoring next. Watkins and substitute Jhon Duran both called Flekken into action in the closing stages, while the returning Tyrone Mings headed just over from a corner. Villa’s drought is over
Heading into this showdown without a win in eight matches across all competitions, Villa’s confidence had taken a knock in recent times. Emery’s side have been unable to build on their early season momentum, but they received two timely boosts ahead of this game, with Emiliano Martinez fit between the sticks despite sustaining a hairline fracture in his hand that forced him off at half- time against Chelsea on Sunday. At the other end of the pitch, Villa’s dangerous counter-attacks were crucial for two of their goals. Those two strikes sandwiched Watkins’ fifth strike in as many matches against his former club. That is the joint-worst road record in the league along with bottom-of-the-table Southampton, and it was another poor display on their travels here, meaning they have now failed to win in all 10 of their league trips to Villa Park. However, it proved a false dawn with Villa’s clinical display in front of goal effectively ending the match as a contest after 34 minutes. Club reports

423,423,brentford,2024-12-04,"Morgan Rogers’ superb goal set Aston Villa on their way to a commanding 3-1 home victory over Brentford, ending their eight-match winless streak in all competitions. Cash’s thumping volley stretched the advantage further, with Mikkel Damsgaard’s second-half strike only proving to be a consolation for Brentford, who continue to struggle away from home. The hosts return to the Premier League’s top half in seventh place on 22 points – two more than Thomas Frank’s side, who slip to ninth. The hosts doubled their advantage seven minutes later when Watkins, who was fouled by Ethan Pinnock, just about beat Mark Flekken from 12 yards, despite the Brentford goalkeeper getting a hand to his spot-kick. Flekken denied Lucas Digne and Watkins shortly after the break before Brentford pulled one back in the 54th minute, as Damsgaard fired into the roof of the net from close range. Watkins and substitute Jhon Duran both called Flekken into action in the closing stages, while the returning Tyrone Mings headed just over from a corner. Nevertheless, the two-goal buffer was enough to get a much-needed win on the board, condemning the Bees to a first defeat in four. Brentford continue to struggle on their travels
Though unbeaten in three matches and on a high after thumping Leicester City last time out, Brentford had only collected one of their 20 points this season away from home. Flekken came to their rescue with some smart saves to prevent the defeat from being even heavier, and although they did pull a goal back through Damsgaard’s well-taken effort, a comeback never looked likely. The Bees struggled to build any momentum off the back of their goal early in the second half, and continued struggles on the road are a cause for concern. Fortunately for Frank, two of their next three league games are on home soil and his side remain well placed in the top half. Club reports

424,424,tottenham-hotspur,2024-11-03,"Dominic Solanke scored twice as Tottenham Hotspur got back to winning ways in the Premier League, coming from behind to beat Aston Villa 4-1. Spurs bounced back from last weekend’s 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace, with four second-half goals turning the contest completely on its head at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Villa had broken the deadlock just after the half-hour mark through Morgan Rogers, but Brennan Johnson levelled within four minutes of the restart. The hosts then completed the turnaround in the final quarter of an hour, with Solanke striking twice in the space of four minutes before substitute James Maddison put some gloss on the scoreline with a stoppage-time free-kick. Spurs climb to seventh in the table with 16 points, two places and two points behind Villa, who missed the chance to jump into the top four. Guglielmo Vicario could only parry after Pedro Porro deflected John McGinn's corner towards goal, and Rogers reacted quickest to score from two yards out. However, Spurs responded well and were back on level terms soon after the break, with Johnson turning in Son Heung-min’s cross at the far post. Solanke was in the right place at the right time again four minutes later following another lovely move, tucking in Richarlison’s square ball at the far post. Maddison then put the icing on the cake in the seventh minute of stoppage time, curling a delicious 20-yard free-kick beyond Martinez. Spurs come from behind once more
Spurs entered this game having conceded the opening goal in 11 of their 13 home Premier League matches in 2024, though they had recovered to win on seven of those occasions. Nevertheless, whatever Ange Postecoglou said to his players during the half-time break certainly had the desired effect, with Johnson quickly equalising. Eyebrows were raised when Son was replaced in the 55th minute after returning to fitness, and with Micky van de Ven already injured, Spurs’ problems intensified when Cristian Romero limped off soon afterwards. However, the hosts did not allow themselves to be affected by that setback, and even after Son’s withdrawal, they showcased their attacking quality to great effect. The way Spurs’ front players exchanged passes for both of Solanke’s goals was breathtaking, before Maddison rounded off the victory with a sumptuous set-piece effort, scoring his 50th Premier League goal. Postecoglou has come in for criticism in the season’s early weeks, but with this level of attacking talent, Spurs will always be a threat. Villa streak screeches to a halt
Without a defeat in seven Premier League matches – and having won nine of their 13 league matches in London under Unai Emery – Villa had every right to arrive at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium feeling confident. However, Johnson’s equaliser appeared to knock the stuffing out of Villa, with the hosts putting themselves firmly in charge of the contest. A trip to Club Brugge awaits on Wednesday, and the mission is to maintain their impressive unbeaten start to this season’s Champions League. What managers said
Ange Postecoglou: ""They are a very good side, they have a level of performance that rarely drops. But we know how difficult it is against Tottenham. ""

426,426,liverpool,2025-02-16,"Liverpool responded to their midweek draw with Everton by beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 to restore their seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League. Four days after James Tarkowski's volley in the eighth minute of stoppage time denied them victory in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, Liverpool were not much more comfortable at Anfield. Luis Diaz bundled in a 15th-minute opener, then was brought down by Josa Sa for a 37th-minute penalty, which Mohamed Salah coolly converted. While the Reds extend their advantage over title rivals Arsenal, Wolves stay 17th, two points clear of Ipswich Town and Leicester City. How the match unfolded
Liverpool made the breakthrough from their first real attack, Diaz bundling a bouncing ball past Sa after Toti Gomes made a mess of his clearance. After Diogo Jota spurned two decent chances, Liverpool got their second goal. Diaz broke in behind and was tripped by Sa, allowing Salah to score down the middle 12 yards. The second half started with chances for both teams, with Marshall Munetsi drawing a one-v-one save from Alisson after being introduced for his Premier League debut, before the offside flag denied Salah a second at the other end. Salah thought he had another chance when referee Simon Hooper awarded Liverpool a second penalty just before the hour, but a VAR review led to that decision being overturned, as it was deemed that Emmanuel Agbadou did not make sufficient contact with Jota as he slid in. Salah gets nervy Liverpool over the line
The pressure was on at the end of a difficult week for Liverpool, after Arsenal's 2-0 win at Leicester City on Saturday narrowed their lead at the summit to four points. Arne Slot was forced to hook Ibrahima Konate for Quansah at half-time to ensure he kept his full complement on the pitch. Liverpool then needed Alisson to make a trademark one-v-one save early in the second period, but the Brazilian was given no chance by Cunha's curler, which ensured a nail-biting finale. In the end, the hosts clung on as Salah's penalty proved to be the winner. The Egyptian's spot-kick was his 32nd successful penalty for Liverpool in the Premier League, matching Steven Gerrard for the most scored by any Reds player. It was also Salah’s 101st goal at Anfield, the joint-third most at a single stadium in Premier League history, with only Sergio Aguero (106 at the Etihad Stadium) and Thierry Henry (116 at Highbury) netting more at one ground. Salah has gotten Liverpool out of jail on several occasions already this season, but Slot will hope for a better team performance on Wednesday's rescheduled trip to Aston Villa, which presents them with a chance to go 10 points clear. A new contract for talismanic forward Cunha had only brought further positivity, and ahead of Sunday's contest, Liverpool head coach Slot said the Brazilian was good enough to play for one of the Premier League's elite clubs. However, he shanked a clearance straight to Diaz for the opener, moments after Pablo Sarabia had cheaply conceded possession to spark the Liverpool attack. Agbadou, meanwhile, felt he was nudged in the back by Diaz in the build-up to Liverpool's penalty, but Sa could have no complaints after rushing from his line to trip the Colombian. Club reports

427,427,wolverhampton,2025-02-16,"Liverpool responded to their midweek draw with Everton by beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 to restore their seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League. However, Wolves threatened on the counter throughout and halved the deficit through Matheus Cunha's second-half stunner, though they were unable to find a late equaliser. While the Reds extend their advantage over title rivals Arsenal, Wolves stay 17th, two points clear of Ipswich Town and Leicester City. How the match unfolded
Liverpool made the breakthrough from their first real attack, Diaz bundling a bouncing ball past Sa after Toti Gomes made a mess of his clearance. Wolves got themselves back in the match in the 67th minute, Cunha turning Ryan Gravenberch to curl a sumptuous strike beyond Alisson from range. That goal made for a nervy finish, but Wolves were unable to create one last big chance, with substitute Jarell Quansah making a heroic block to deny Munetsi at the death. The Frenchman had clumsily flattened Cunha from behind when already on a yellow card and appeared in danger of losing his cool. Liverpool then needed Alisson to make a trademark one-v-one save early in the second period, but the Brazilian was given no chance by Cunha's curler, which ensured a nail-biting finale. Cunha almost sparks revival
Wolves' upturn under Vitor Pereira stalled as they started 2025 with four straight Premier League defeats, but back-to-back victories over Villa and Blackburn Rovers – the latter in the FA Cup – had lifted the mood. A new contract for talismanic forward Cunha had only brought further positivity, and ahead of Sunday's contest, Liverpool head coach Slot said the Brazilian was good enough to play for one of the Premier League's elite clubs. There remains a belief that Cunha could move on at the end of the campaign, and he did his burgeoning reputation no harm here. Ultimately, however, Wolves gave themselves slightly too much to do with an error-strewn defensive performance in the first half. Prior to Sunday, Pereira's Wolves had not conceded a single goal while Toti was on the pitch. However, he shanked a clearance straight to Diaz for the opener, moments after Pablo Sarabia had cheaply conceded possession to spark the Liverpool attack. With the fixture list becoming a little kinder from here, Wolves must dust themselves down and go again. Club reports

428,428,aston-villa,2025-02-19,"Liverpool missed the chance to move 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League after they were held in in an entertaining 2-2 draw by Aston Villa. Having seen an earlier goal ruled out for offside, Villa scored twice in 10 minutes before the break, with Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins on target for the hosts. The result edged Liverpool’s advantage over second-placed Arsenal to eight points, having played one match more, while Villa stay in ninth, five points adrift of the top four. How the match unfolded
Liverpool edged ahead in the 29th minute when Garcia’s poor pass to Emiliano Martinez was gathered by Diogo Jota, who raced into the area and squared for Salah to fire home. But Villa dragged themselves level after Liverpool failed to deal with Marcus Rashford’s teasing free-kick, with Dominik Szoboszlai’s clearing header met by Tielemans’ first-time volley. Watkins then headed the hosts ahead in the third minute of first-half stoppage time, guiding Lucas Digne’s cross with a fine header beyond the grasp of Alisson Becker. Liverpool, however, restored parity just after the hour when Alexander-Arnold’s strike from the edge of the area deflected off Tyrone Mings and over Martinez’s dive. Slot left to rue missed opportunities
Liverpool’s title credentials were questioned after their nervy win over Wolverhampton Wanderers last time out, and their inability to finish their chances proved costly at Villa Park. Curtis Jones then brilliantly slipped in Szoboszlai but saw his strike smothered by Martinez, with their glut of opportunities ruthlessly punished by Villa in the final 10 minutes of the half. Perhaps a pivotal moment in the contest was sandwiched between Tielemans and Watkins’ goals. Jota, who had earlier thrashed a volley wide of the mark, was played in behind barely a minute after Villa had levelled. Normally so composed in front of goal, the Liverpool forward uncharacteristically skewed his effort high and wide when faced one-on-one with Martinez. A point to build on for the Villans
Having drawn four of their last six Premier League matches, Villa have seen their push for the top four stutter, but their point against the leaders is something positive to build on. In the Premier League this term, only Southampton (17) have made more errors leading to goals than Unai Emery’s side (12), but their response to that early setback was emphatic. After being hit on the counter-attack in their defeat at Anfield earlier in the season, Villa struck Liverpool with two quickfire goals. Though Liverpool looked the more likely to add to their lead, Villa themselves had two excellent opportunities to snatch three points late on, with Morgan Rogers firing over the crossbar before substitute Malen rifled an effort narrowly wide.

429,429,liverpool,2025-02-19,"Liverpool missed the chance to move 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League after they were held in in an entertaining 2-2 draw by Aston Villa. Mohamed Salah opened the scoring with his 24th league goal of the season, flashing the ball into the roof of the net as Liverpool ruthlessly punished Andres Garcia’s slack backpass. But Liverpool showed their powers of recovery once more, with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s deflected strike seeing the points shared, though substitute Darwin Nunez spurned a huge chance late on. The result edged Liverpool’s advantage over second-placed Arsenal to eight points, having played one match more, while Villa stay in ninth, five points adrift of the top four. How the match unfolded

Arne Slot’s side continued to push for a winner and almost found it through substitute Nunez, but the Uruguayan somehow fired Szoboszlai's square ball over the crossbar, with Donyell Malen’s effort in second-half stoppage time narrowly evading the far post. Slot left to rue missed opportunities
Liverpool’s title credentials were questioned after their nervy win over Wolverhampton Wanderers last time out, and their inability to finish their chances proved costly at Villa Park. A quick start to the contest saw Liverpool assert their authority, with Virgil van Dijk firing over after a slick corner routine, before Jota was denied twice in quick succession, first seeing his shot blocked by Mings before heading wide from Alexander-Arnold’s cross. Normally so composed in front of goal, the Liverpool forward uncharacteristically skewed his effort high and wide when faced one-on-one with Martinez. Liverpool struck the crossbar through Jota before Alexander-Arnold’s equaliser, and despite their best efforts, could not find a way through. Though Slot’s unbeaten away record remains intact, it feels like an opportunity missed. The hosts thought they had got ahead after neat play between Marco Asensio and Rashford saw the ball turned home, but the on-loan Manchester United forward was offside in the build-up inside the Liverpool box. But the way that Garcia gifted Liverpool have been the story of their season. After being hit on the counter-attack in their defeat at Anfield earlier in the season, Villa struck Liverpool with two quickfire goals. But despite their advantage going into half-time, were unable to withstand the wave of Liverpool pressure that eventually told in the 61st minute.

430,430,arsenal,2024-12-04,"Goals from two corner routines handed Ruben Amorim his first Premier League defeat as Manchester United were beaten 2-0 by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday. After being frustrated in the first half by United, the hosts found the breakthrough when Jurrien Timber glanced Declan Rice’s corner beyond Andre Onana in the 54th minute. Arsenal doubled their lead in similar fashion, this time from the opposite side when Bukayo Saka’s back-post delivery was headed back across by Thomas Partey, with William Saliba providing the finishing touch. Kai Havertz almost put the hosts further in front but was thwarted by Onana, with substitute Mikel Merino nearly scoring from another corner moments later. Despite victory, Arsenal drop to third after Chelsea’s 5-1 thrashing of Southampton, but they close the gap to leaders Liverpool to seven points, while United are 11th. How the match unfolded
Arsenal had the ball in the net inside the first five minutes when Gabriel Martinelli tucked home from Havertz’s cushioned pass, but the offside flag was raised with German ahead of play. Despite being without the injured Gabriel Magalhaes, the Gunners almost went ahead through a corner routine, with Saka’s delivery headed narrowly wide by Partey. However, the hosts did get themselves in front with a well-worked set-piece in the second half, with Timber brilliantly flicking Rice’s corner in at the front post for his first Arsenal goal. They continued to threaten from corners and almost went two up when another in-swinging delivery from Rice was headed off the line by a combination of Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte. But the Gunners sealed the win in the 73rd minute through another corner, with Saliba guiding the ball over the line after being found by Partey’s header across goal. Arsenal set-pieces do the business
Many teams have weapons, and Arsenal showcased that set-pieces are one of theirs as they overcame a tepid first-half display to win comfortably. The Gunners were unable to create any clear-cut chances in the opening exchanges, failing to register a shot on target in the first 45 minutes, but started after the interval on the front foot. Rice, however, could not find the finishing touch, but he proved his effectiveness on set-piece duties when he picked out Timber for the opening goal. Arsenal dominated proceedings after that, though were handed some nervy moments at the other end by their opponents. They managed to find a two-goal cushion through Saliba, and perhaps should have scored more. Havertz saw his near-post effort brilliantly blocked by Onana before Merino headed narrowly wide later on. It is a London derby next for the Gunners against Fulham at Craven Cottage, with Marco Silva the next manager tasked with stopping Arsenal’s impressive set-pieces. Saliba’s second left an air of inevitability about the result, with United again unable to defend a corner. There was the positive of Leny Yoro’s first Premier League appearance, but the French defender was unable to stop Arsenal’s dead-ball dominance. Club reports

Bruno Fernandes, so often United’s main man under former boss Erik ten Hag, stepped up and sent the Chelsea goalkeeper the wrong way to put the hosts on course for a much-needed victory. But Man Utd's joy was short-lived thanks to a bolt from Chelsea blue, courtesy of the right foot of Caicedo, who sent a 74th-minute first-time volley into the bottom-left corner. The draw means Chelsea edge past Arsenal and into the top four, while Man Utd – who on Friday confirmed the appointment of Ruben Amorim – moved up one place to 13th. United also hit the woodwork with an effort of their own in first-half stoppage time as Fernandes’ smart pass found Marcus Rashford, who rattled the crossbar. While Chelsea continued to threaten, it was United that opened the scoring when Sanchez’s rash attempt to smother the ball resulted in him bringing down Hojlund, with Fernandes scoring the resulting spot-kick. Enzo Maresca’s side almost completed a remarkable turnaround when Enzo Fernandez fired over a minute later, while Alejandro Garnacho and Fernandes also missed opportunities to snatch the win for United late on. Plenty to ponder for Amorim
In Man Utd's first match since announcing Sporting CP's Amorim as their new head coach, they gave their incoming boss plenty to review. The best of their chances saw Fernandes fire over following good work from Rashford, before the England international struck the woodwork. The hosts then had to withstand a wave of Chelsea pressure but were able to create chances on the break with Rashford again involved, his strike testing Sanchez before Garnacho scuffed a glorious chance into the grateful arms of the Blues goalkeeper soon afterwards. Their breakthrough came through a combination of Casemiro’s quality pass to Hojlund and the rashness of Sanchez in trying to claim the ball, as Fernandes remained composed from 12 yards. But Caicedo’s equaliser showed the size of the task Amorim faces when he arrives in Manchester on 11 November, with United now having endured their worst start to a Premier League campaign through the opening 10 matches. Matthijs de Ligt was on hand to deny Palmer in the opening exchanges with a timely interception, though the Blues failed to trouble Andre Onana in the first half, registering just one shot on target from the six they attempted in the first 45 minutes. Pedro Neto’s snapshot within nine minutes of the restart was a sign of their intent, but despite their control in possession, they were hit with a sucker punch when Sanchez needlessly brought down Hojlund, allowing Fernandes to open the scoring. Caicedo’s equaliser was the least the Blues merited from their showing after the break, though they needed their goalscorer to come to their rescue when the midfielder deflected Garnacho’s cross over the bar in the fifth minute of stoppage time.

Clear-cut chances were hard to come by during a tentative first half, though Chelsea went closest when Noni Madueke struck the post with a header from Cole Palmer’s corner. While Chelsea continued to threaten, it was United that opened the scoring when Sanchez’s rash attempt to smother the ball resulted in him bringing down Hojlund, with Fernandes scoring the resulting spot-kick. But just four minutes later, the hosts found themselves level again when Casemiro’s headed clearance dropped kindly for Caicedo, who rifled the ball home.

But Caicedo’s equaliser showed the size of the task Amorim faces when he arrives in Manchester on 11 November, with United now having endured their worst start to a Premier League campaign through the opening 10 matches. Blues impress but just fall short
Chelsea’s improvement under Maresca has been evident so far this season, but the Blues just lacked the clinical edge they have shown in recent weeks on Sunday. Matthijs de Ligt was on hand to deny Palmer in the opening exchanges with a timely interception, though the Blues failed to trouble Andre Onana in the first half, registering just one shot on target from the six they attempted in the first 45 minutes. Caicedo’s equaliser was the least the Blues merited from their showing after the break, though they needed their goalscorer to come to their rescue when the midfielder deflected Garnacho’s cross over the bar in the fifth minute of stoppage time.

434,434,tottenham-hotspur,2025-02-16,"Tottenham Hotspur earned back-to-back Premier League wins with a 1-0 home triumph over Manchester United. Having beaten Brentford two weeks ago to end a seven-match winless run, Spurs earned their first victory at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since early November. James Maddison got the all-important goal after just 13 minutes, turning in the rebound after Lucas Bergvall had a shot saved. How the match unfolded
Spurs managed to survive a flurry of early United chances; Rasmus Hojlund’s low drive was pushed away by Guglielmo Vicario, with the Italian – back from injury after three months out – then palming Garnacho’s curler clear in the next phase. United were punished just moments later at the other end as Andre Onana pushed Bergvall’s low strike straight to Maddison, who coolly fired in. Postecoglou finds relief
Spurs stopped the rot in the Premier League last time out with a 2-0 win over Brentford, but they found themselves back under pressure after a miserable week saw them crash out of both the EFL Cup and the FA Cup. They had not won back-to-back league matches since September, but some huge injury boosts, including the returns of Vicario and Maddison to the starting line-up, lifted the mood ahead of kick-off. Maddison, meanwhile, marked his return with a goal but also provided a spark in midfield throughout the first half. Elsewhere, new boy Mathys Tel – a reported United target before joining Spurs – was a constant threat and was unlucky not to mark his Premier League debut with a goal as Onana kept him out. Ange Postecoglou has never lost to United in the Premier League, and Spurs' third win over them this campaign has certainly helped to ease the pressure. However, the Spurs head coach knows they need to build some momentum with struggling Ipswich Town up next. Amorim’s injury headache
While Spurs’ injury crisis has shown some signs of easing, United now have mounting problems of their own, with Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Lisandro Martinez all out. Considering their problems in the final third this term though, perhaps the biggest blow dealt to them was that concerning Amad, who Amorim conceded before the match could miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury.

Alejandro Garnacho squandered a glorious chance shortly afterwards, with United unable to find an equaliser despite applying plenty of pressure. The hosts move up to 12th in the table on 30 points, leapfrogging United, who sit one point and three places below them in 15th. How the match unfolded

United were punished just moments later at the other end as Andre Onana pushed Bergvall’s low strike straight to Maddison, who coolly fired in. Garnacho should have levelled 10 minutes later, but he blazed over the crossbar under no pressure after Bruno Fernandes’ clever lay-off. The Argentinian led the United charge in the second half, twice forcing Vicario into action, first from a tight angle on the right side of the area, then with a low strike at the near post. Joshua Zirkzee glanced a header wide of the far post, while Djed Spence slid in to block Hojlund’s shot after Onana had kept out Dejan Kulusevki and sparked a quick counter. But United were unable to make that pressure tell, leaving Ruben Amorim to face up to another demoralising defeat. Vicario’s absence has been keenly felt and he showed his worth after just 10 minutes, making an impressive double save to deny Hojlund and Garnacho, while he was also sent scrambling by a Zirkzee effort that fizzed wide of the post. Elsewhere, new boy Mathys Tel – a reported United target before joining Spurs – was a constant threat and was unlucky not to mark his Premier League debut with a goal as Onana kept him out.

The outstanding Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon had earlier scored for Eddie Howe's much-improved Magpies, either side of Curtis Jones sweeping home on his 150th Liverpool appearance. While Newcastle are 10th, Liverpool's lead at the summit now stands at seven points, with Chelsea and Arsenal both gaining ground after their respective wins against Southampton and Manchester United. It was the hosts who took the lead after 35 minutes, Isak holding off Virgil van Dijk before crashing a wonderful effort into the top-right corner from outside the area. Kelleher then denied Gordon with a one-on-one save, and the Reds drew level five minutes into the second half as Jones brilliantly swept Salah's cutback into the roof of the net. Newcastle inched ahead once again in the 62nd minute – Gordon cutting past Joe Gomez to fire home after linking up with Isak – but that lead was short-lived as Liverpool substitute Trent Alexander-Arnold found Salah for a simple finish. When Kelleher was caught beneath Guimaraes' floated cross in the final minute of normal time, Schar slid into an empty net at the far post to send the St James' Park crowd into raptures. Newcastle find their shooting boots
After plundering 85 Premier League goals in 2023/24, Newcastle have seen their attacking efforts come under scrutiny in the early months of 2024/25, with Saturday's 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace – in which they failed to record a shot on target, scoring via an own goal – doing nothing to quieten their critics. On Wednesday, though, they were back to their old selves, with the indomitable Isak leading the way. Taking in Guimaraes' pass between the Liverpool lines, Isak showed tremendous strength and awareness to hold off Van Dijk before getting the ball out of his feet and lashing home the opener. At his best, Isak is one of the Premier League's finest all-round forwards, and he had already carved out two wonderful opportunities for team-mates before breaking the deadlock. Isak did register an assist after the break, timing his pass to perfection to release Gordon for Newcastle's second goal, and if the Swede can stay fit and firing, Newcastle can challenge any team in this division. However, Howe will know an improvement is needed at the back after they were cut apart by Salah and company after the interval. However, that speculation has certainly not distracted Salah from his game. But Newcastle tend to provide a sterner test than most, particularly on home soil, and if Salah can continue his incredible form, the Reds – who face city rivals Everton on Saturday – will be difficult to catch.

437,437,liverpool,2024-12-04,"Fabian Schar scored a 90th-minute equaliser as Newcastle United salvaged a 3-3 draw against Premier League leaders Liverpool in an absorbing contest at St James' Park. Liverpool were on course for a fifth straight league win when Mohamed Salah turned a thrilling match on its head with a second-half double. The outstanding Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon had earlier scored for Eddie Howe's much-improved Magpies, either side of Curtis Jones sweeping home on his 150th Liverpool appearance. While Newcastle are 10th, Liverpool's lead at the summit now stands at seven points, with Chelsea and Arsenal both gaining ground after their respective wins against Southampton and Manchester United. How the match unfolded
Both sides struck the woodwork during a lively opening, Alexis Mac Allister hitting the base of the post before Jacob Murphy did the same at the other end. It was the hosts who took the lead after 35 minutes, Isak holding off Virgil van Dijk before crashing a wonderful effort into the top-right corner from outside the area. Kelleher then denied Gordon with a one-on-one save, and the Reds drew level five minutes into the second half as Jones brilliantly swept Salah's cutback into the roof of the net. Newcastle inched ahead once again in the 62nd minute – Gordon cutting past Joe Gomez to fire home after linking up with Isak – but that lead was short-lived as Liverpool substitute Trent Alexander-Arnold found Salah for a simple finish. Salah thought he had won it for Liverpool when he tucked home brilliantly on the turn, but there was to be a final twist. Taking in Guimaraes' pass between the Liverpool lines, Isak showed tremendous strength and awareness to hold off Van Dijk before getting the ball out of his feet and lashing home the opener. It was his well-placed through-ball that allowed Murphy in to rattle a post, and he could also have had an assist when sliding a pass between Van Dijk's legs to find Lewis Hall, only for a fine recovery challenge from Gomez to save Liverpool. However, Howe will know an improvement is needed at the back after they were cut apart by Salah and company after the interval. Salah exploits not enough for victory
Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Manchester City last Sunday was soon overshadowed by talk regarding Salah's future at the club. However, that speculation has certainly not distracted Salah from his game. He supplied a pinpoint cutback for Jones to crash home when Liverpool were on the back foot at 1-0 down, and was later in the right place at the right time to convert two Alexander-Arnold crosses, the England international making a fine impact after coming on as a 68th-minute substitute. Salah has now registered both a goal and an assist in 37 different Premier League matches, more than any other player in the competition's history. Arne Slot will be bitterly disappointed that Salah's exploits were not enough to hand Liverpool three points, with a momentary lapse from Kelleher giving Schar an empty net to tuck into in the final minute of the 90. But Newcastle tend to provide a sterner test than most, particularly on home soil, and if Salah can continue his incredible form, the Reds – who face city rivals Everton on Saturday – will be difficult to catch.

438,438,fulham,2024-11-04,"Harry Wilson scored twice in stoppage time as Fulham came back to beat Brentford 2-1 in an enthralling west London derby. Wilson was the hero from Fulham’s bench on Monday, as Marco Silva’s team – who were on the wrong end of a late comeback against Everton last time out in the Premier League – salvaged a victory from the jaws of defeat. Fulham will feel it was a win they earned from a match they dominated from the off, with the Bees having taken the lead against the run of play through Vitaly Janelt’s stunning 24th-minute strike. But the Fulham pressure finally told when Wilson brilliantly flicked a cross from Adama Traore in the second minute of stoppage time, and – after Bernd Leno made a superb stop to thwart Brentford at the other end – the former Liverpool midfielder nodded in again to send Craven Cottage into raptures. Fulham’s win takes them up into ninth, while Brentford drop to 12th after suffering a fifth league loss of the season. How the match unfolded
Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken was quickly called into action, following up a comfortable stop from Fulham's Raul Jimenez’s effort with a fantastic double save to deny Reiss Nelson. But after Emile Smith Rowe and Nelson failed to capitalise on better goalscoring chances, Fulham were left stunned as Brentford scored with their first meaningful venture forward – Janelt drilling a brilliant long-range strike into the bottom-right corner. Fulham continued to probe, but when Rodrigo Muniz spurned a decent chance in the 88th minute, their chances of salvaging a point appeared to be over. Wilson, though, had other ideas, as he somehow sent a backheel spiralling over Flekken and into the left-hand side of Brentford’s goal. Leno subsequently denied Fabio Carvalho a goal against his former club, and Wilson swiftly made his goalkeeper’s work count with a strike that came off his shoulder in the final minutes. Fulham’s substitutes prove the difference
For so long, it looked like Fulham would be finishing the match empty handed, but Silva’s substitutes paid off as the hosts completely flipped the encounter on its head. At half-time, Silva will have felt unlucky – Fulham had dominated from the first whistle, only to be caught out by a quick counter-attack (and a brilliant finish) after losing the ball in midfield, and it was clear he was not keen to make any rash changes. Their desperation started to show as the clock ticked closer to the end of the 90th minute, though, with the likes of Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey sending tame long-range shots straight at Flekken. But the introduction of Traore and, in particular, Wilson, sparked a comeback that will live long in the memory. After that duo combined down the right to restore parity, Robinson finally got some joy on the opposite flank, picking out Fulham’s matchwinner for a diving header. Whether Wilson meant either of his finishes will matter not to Fulham. They still struggled to make inroads against Fulham’s high press, with the usually influential Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa unable to assert themselves as the hosts wasted chance after chance. Brentford staunchly defended against the crosses being peppered into their box, but a drop in concentration at the wrong time eventually cost them, even if Wilson’s first finish was a touch of genius (or, a slice of luck).

440,440,leicester-city,2025-02-15,"Arsenal moved four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after Mikel Merino’s late double saw off struggling Leicester City 2-0. After losing Kai Havertz to a season-ending injury, Mikel Arteta went without a recognised forward at the King Power Stadium, where the visitors ultimately required a superb-sub cameo from midfielder Merino. Leicester remain in the bottom three, two points from safety. How the match unfolded
An uneventful first half saw little goalmouth action, with Wilfred Ndidi’s volley from the edge of the box comfortably gathered by David Raya. Though Arsenal dominated possession, Ndidi again went close just before the break, sending his header wide having been brilliantly picked out by Victor Kristiansen’s wicked delivery. The visitors improved after half-time and almost edged ahead through the impressive Nwaneri, who flicked the crossbar with a thumping effort before he saw another fine attempt tipped onto the right-hand post by Mads Hermansen. Nwaneri turned provider with a delicately lofted delivery from the right, with the Spain international directing his header out of Hermansen’s reach. Arsenal were caught offside four times before the break, as they struggled to break down Leicester. Foxes left reeling after another late show
After going down to Manchester United in contentions fashion in the FA Cup last week, Leicester were once again undone in the closing stages, denying them what might have proved a vital point in their fight to stay up. Ayew almost gave the Foxes supporters something to cheer inside the opening minute after breaking in behind the Arsenal defence, before Ndidi’s volley was stopped by Raya. Ndidi should have done better with his headed opportunity late in the first half, but in Leicester’s quest for the opening goal, they left themselves exposed at the back, and they were eventually undone by two moments of quality. Despite a positive display in many ways, with Arsenal limited to few clear chances, it was another disappointing result for Ruud van Nistelrooy’s team, who welcome Brentford to the King Power Stadium in their next Premier League outing.

441,441,arsenal,2025-02-15,"Arsenal moved four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after Mikel Merino’s late double saw off struggling Leicester City 2-0. Buoyed by Everton’s last-gasp equaliser in Wednesday's Merseyside derby, Arsenal took the chance to close the gap on Liverpool, though they had to be patient on Saturday. After losing Kai Havertz to a season-ending injury, Mikel Arteta went without a recognised forward at the King Power Stadium, where the visitors ultimately required a superb-sub cameo from midfielder Merino. Merino doubled his tally six minutes later, sealing a victory that consolidates Arsenal’s place in second. Though Arsenal dominated possession, Ndidi again went close just before the break, sending his header wide having been brilliantly picked out by Victor Kristiansen’s wicked delivery. Is Merino Arteta’s attacking answer?
After confirming that Havertz would miss the rest of the season earlier this week, and with Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka also sidelined with long-term injuries, Arteta may have found the man to lead his line for the foreseeable future in Merino. It was the first time that Arsenal were starting without at least one of Havertz, Jesus or Saka in the Premier League since a 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion on the final day of the 2020/21 campaign, with Nwaneri, Trossard and Sterling getting the nod. And apart from Declan Rice’s glanced header, the Gunners rarely threatened in the first half, perhaps down to a lack of fluidity in their attack. Arsenal were caught offside four times before the break, as they struggled to break down Leicester. In the 69th minute, Arteta turned to his bench and moved Merino to the top of his attack – it was an inspired substitution that may have just helped keep his side firmly in the title race. Merino, who has started just eight Premier League matches this season, may now find himself in the starting XI more regularly as Arteta looks to deal with his injury crisis up front, with a London derby at Emirates Stadium against West Ham United up next for Arsenal. Ayew almost gave the Foxes supporters something to cheer inside the opening minute after breaking in behind the Arsenal defence, before Ndidi’s volley was stopped by Raya. A potentially crucial moment came eight minutes before Arsenal took the lead, with Ayew’s teasing delivery across the face of goal almost finding Bobby De Cordova-Reid at the back, but Myles Lewis-Skelly was on hand to brilliantly turn the ball behind for a corner. Despite a positive display in many ways, with Arsenal limited to few clear chances, it was another disappointing result for Ruud van Nistelrooy’s team, who welcome Brentford to the King Power Stadium in their next Premier League outing.

442,442,manchester-city,2024-12-04,"Manchester City won for the first time in eight matches across all competitions, as they produced an assured 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola’s side came into the game having lost four Premier League matches on the bounce and they were on a seven-match winless run in all competitions. But goals from Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne and Jeremy Doku earned the champions a much-needed victory. De Bruyne assisted Silva’s early close-range opener before doubling City’s lead just after the half-hour mark, giving Matz Sels no chance with his powerful strike. Doku rounded off a confidence-boosting display for the hosts in the 57th minute, finishing off a brilliant counter-attack with a fine curling shot as City earned their first win since 26 October. City’s victory moved them back into the top four and reduced their gap behind leaders Liverpool to nine points, while a third loss in four games leaves Forest on 22 points. How the match unfolded
It took just eight minutes for City to break the deadlock and settle the home fans’ nerves, as De Bruyne rose high to nod towards the goal line where Silva stretched out a leg to poke it in. De Bruyne was in the thick of the action, with his sloppy pass almost gifting an equaliser to Chris Wood, who missed from a one-v-one situation, shortly before the Belgian rifled City’s second goal past Sels. City made sure of victory when they exploited the space in behind as Forest committed bodies forward, with Erling Haaland sliding in Doku, who cut inside to bend a wonderful strike into the bottom-right corner. De Bruyne also fizzed a low free-kick around the wall and just wide of the near post, while Anthony Elanga’s attempt for a consolation floated narrowly over Ortega’s crossbar as City held on comfortably. De Bruyne provides the spark
Guardiola has rung the changes without reward over recent weeks as he tried to turn City’s fortunes around. It seems De Bruyne was the missing piece to their puzzle after his influential display ensured they returned to winning ways. The midfielder – making his first Premier League start in nearly three months – orchestrated the hosts from the start, setting up Haaland for an early chance that Sels parried before De Bruyne set up the opener. Even after Wood pounced on his mistake, De Bruyne’s confidence did not waver, showcased by his fine finish in the 31st minute. City were also boosted by the strong displays from Doku and Jack Grealish on their returns to the starting line-up, with the former causing havoc down the left. Despite holding a big lead, Guardiola will not have felt secure until the final whistle was blown given City’s recent collapse in their 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the UEFA Champions League, but this time his team were able to hold out for a much-needed three points without any undue stress. Disjointed Forest undone
Forest may have hoped it was an ideal time to face City given the hosts’ recent poor form, though on reflection it could have been the worst time to play them, as Guardiola had his refreshed team fired up after their uncharacteristic run of defeats. Gibbs-White and Wood both had brilliant chances to equalise before De Bruyne’s goal, and the away fans were astounded when the latter dragged his chance wide of the far post under little pressure given his recent hot streak in front of goal. However, that was their downfall, as City were able to exploit the space in behind and ruthlessly wrap up the win with a third goal. Club reports

Having been beaten 4-0 by Manchester United on Sunday, Everton responded in force at Goodison Park by the same scoreline against a team also battling at the wrong end of the table. Orel Mangala then doubled Everton’s advantage with a stinging, deflected shot, after the hosts had also had a goal disallowed. Everton’s set-piece proficiency continued in the second half – Craig Dawson twice turned into his own net as he challenged Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Sean Dyche's side claimed a morale-boosting win that takes them 15th, five points clear of the bottom three, with Wolves in 19th. How the match unfolded
Everton were off the mark after 10 minutes when Young curled a low free-kick around the Wolves wall and in at Jose Sa’s near post. The Toffees exposed Wolves’ set-piece fragility again as Dwight McNeil swung a cross in for James Tarkowski to head home. Jordan Pickford denied Wolves an equaliser when Jorgen Strand Larsen outmuscled Tarkowski, while the visiting forward also glanced wide from a cross, but Gary O’Neil’s team were left to rue those misses in the 33rd minute when Mangala stormed onto a loose ball and hammered in a strike that deflected beyond Sa. Everton had their third four minutes after half-time, Dawson netting the first of his two own goals as he battled with Calvert-Lewin from McNeil’s corner. But Everton added further gloss when Dawson diverted in as he lunged to block Calvert-Lewin’s stooping header. Everton's dead-ball prowess
All four of the hosts’ goals started with a dead-ball scenario, and this is a weapon Dyche has relied on during his time at Goodison. That threat has been nullified in recent weeks, with the Toffees having not scored in four games heading into Wednesday’s contest, but they sharpened up against a Wolves defence that simply could not handle Everton’s physicality in the box. Yet it was McNeil’s crosses that caused the visitors the most consternation. The hosts’ second should have been warning enough as Wolves failed to clear from McNeil’s delivery out on the right, which allowed Mangala the space and time to unleash a stinging shot from the edge of the box. That came after Tarkowski had been given a free header from close range too, with that goal disallowed. Everton’s next two goals benefited more directly from McNeil’s deliveries. First, he sent a great ball to the back post, and while Calvert-Lewin didn’t get the final touch, such was the placement, Dawson could only nudge it in. It was another superb delivery from the right by McNeil that allowed Calvert-Lewin a slight touch at the near post before Dawson’s attempted block flew into the bottom corner and past Sa, as Everton returned to scoring form in style ahead of facing local rivals Liverpool on Saturday. Calvert-Lewin was nearly gifted a goal as miscommunication between Sa and Dawson forced the latter to make a hasty clearance. Sa was left raging at his ineffective wall for Young’s opener before the visitors twice allowed Tarkowski to rise uncontested in the box to head goalwards. Dawson’s misfortune epitomised the malaise of the Wolves defence as, after conceding an own goal, he repeated the earlier mistake to send a slow backpass dangerously close to the pursuing Calvert-Lewin, leaving Sa to sweep up.

445,445,wolverhampton,2024-12-04,"Everton returned to form after a five-match winless run with an emphatic 4-0 home win over struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers. Sean Dyche's side claimed a morale-boosting win that takes them 15th, five points clear of the bottom three, with Wolves in 19th. How the match unfolded
Everton were off the mark after 10 minutes when Young curled a low free-kick around the Wolves wall and in at Jose Sa’s near post. The Toffees exposed Wolves’ set-piece fragility again as Dwight McNeil swung a cross in for James Tarkowski to head home. Jordan Pickford denied Wolves an equaliser when Jorgen Strand Larsen outmuscled Tarkowski, while the visiting forward also glanced wide from a cross, but Gary O’Neil’s team were left to rue those misses in the 33rd minute when Mangala stormed onto a loose ball and hammered in a strike that deflected beyond Sa. That threat has been nullified in recent weeks, with the Toffees having not scored in four games heading into Wednesday’s contest, but they sharpened up against a Wolves defence that simply could not handle Everton’s physicality in the box. Young was the first to benefit as he capitalised on Wolves’ misplaced wall to curl a low shot home. The hosts’ second should have been warning enough as Wolves failed to clear from McNeil’s delivery out on the right, which allowed Mangala the space and time to unleash a stinging shot from the edge of the box. Defensive discipline costs Wolves
It took only four minutes before Wolves showed their first signs of defensive vulnerability. While they remained error-prone inside their own half, with Matheus Cunha guilty of conceding possession in danger areas on a couple of occasions, their defence at set-pieces also left much to be desired. Dawson’s misfortune epitomised the malaise of the Wolves defence as, after conceding an own goal, he repeated the earlier mistake to send a slow backpass dangerously close to the pursuing Calvert-Lewin, leaving Sa to sweep up. While a favourable run of fixtures awaits Wolves, such mistakes will need to be cut out if they are to pick up the necessary points to drag themselves out of trouble. Club reports

Erling Haaland had given City a deserved lead in the first half, but they were pegged back by another substitute in Joao Pedro in the 78th minute. It is a win that lifts Brighton to fourth in the table, while second-place City missed the chance to go top and sit two points behind Liverpool, who play Aston Villa later on Saturday. Brighton upped the pressure in the second half and Joao Pedro looked to have wasted the best chance as he dragged wide from a one-on-one. O’Riley sent the Amex into raptures shortly after as he breached the backline to poke the winner past Ederson. Hurzeler’s substitutions have Brighton soaring
One could say that this was the worst time for Brighton to face Manchester City, with the visitors always likely to be determined to end their recent losing run. But the Seagulls had a point to prove, too. But nothing can be taken away from Brighton’s second-half performance as they used width to their advantage, peppering crosses into the box while piling bodies forward to force mistakes high up the field. With City’s defence struggling to cope, the freshness of Joao Pedro and O’Riley helped take full advantage. They still had to dig deep in the final moments with City pushing for an equaliser, but their defence was resolute as they recorded a famous victory at the Amex Stadium. Haaland’s 12th Premier League goal of the season looked to be setting them on their way to a much-needed three points as they continuously caused Brighton problems before the break. Brighton, however, turned the tide with more space opening up and Guardiola’s side looked uncharacteristically disorganised as they failed to clear their lines from the equaliser. Club reports

447,447,manchester-city,2024-11-09,"Premier League debutant Matt O’Riley proved Brighton & Hove Albion’s hero as he completed a turnaround in a 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Amex Stadium. The substitute returned from injury with a bang as he condemned Pep Guardiola to a fourth successive defeat in all competitions for the first time in his managerial career. Erling Haaland had given City a deserved lead in the first half, but they were pegged back by another substitute in Joao Pedro in the 78th minute. It is a win that lifts Brighton to fourth in the table, while second-place City missed the chance to go top and sit two points behind Liverpool, who play Aston Villa later on Saturday. How the match unfolded
City started the game with purpose, with Savinho forcing a smart save out of Bart Verbruggen from a tight angle on the right before Haaland ballooned a volley well wide on the stretch. Haaland could have bagged a second moments later, only for Verbruggen to turn his tight effort against the post, while Danny Welbeck sent a free-kick narrowly wide at the other end just before the break. Hurzeler’s substitutions have Brighton soaring
One could say that this was the worst time for Brighton to face Manchester City, with the visitors always likely to be determined to end their recent losing run. They were sloppy in the first half, with their usual possession-based game causing more problems for themselves, and City benefited from a loose pass in midfield to take the lead. With City’s defence struggling to cope, the freshness of Joao Pedro and O’Riley helped take full advantage. They still had to dig deep in the final moments with City pushing for an equaliser, but their defence was resolute as they recorded a famous victory at the Amex Stadium. City’s struggles continue
Guardiola has remained resolute over the last 10 days, insisting before this match that City were not in a “dark place” like Bernardo Silva had suggested after their 4-1 defeat to Sporting CP in the Champions League. Never before had the Spaniard lost four games in a row in his managerial career and, though he may point to City’s injury troubles as part of the reason, it came down to the difference between the first and second halves here. Haaland’s 12th Premier League goal of the season looked to be setting them on their way to a much-needed three points as they continuously caused Brighton problems before the break. Brighton, however, turned the tide with more space opening up and Guardiola’s side looked uncharacteristically disorganised as they failed to clear their lines from the equaliser. With big games against Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool up next for them in the Premier League after the international break, Guardiola will be hoping they can change their luck sooner rather than later.

448,448,aston-villa,2025-02-15,"Ollie Watkins spared Aston Villa's blushes as they rallied to earn a 1-1 draw with 10-man Ipswich Town on Saturday. Axel Tuanzebe, who had three separate loan spells with Villa between 2018 and 2022, was sent off on his return to Villa Park after receiving two yellow cards in the first half. Ipswich had their work cut out from then on, but they took a surprise lead early in the second half when Liam Delap beat Emiliano Martinez with a clever near-post finish. A victory would have taken Ipswich level on points with 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League table, but Watkins broke their resolve on the rebound after half-time substitute Marcus Rashford struck the woodwork from a free-kick. Villa drop one place to ninth, six points off the top four. How the match unfolded
Villa failed to turn their dominance of possession into chances until the 35th minute, when Watkins broke in behind but could only prod wide on the stretch. Morgan Rogers was denied by Alex Palmer as Villa laid siege to the Ipswich area, but the visitors stunned Villa Park with a 56th-minute opener. But Villa continued to press and finally levelled in the 69th minute. Rashford rattled the crossbar with a brilliant free-kick from 25 yards out, and the ball dropped for a grateful Watkins to tap home. Marco Asensio squandered two good chances to win it for Villa, then Palmer made a heroic save to deny Rogers deep into stoppage time as Ipswich held on to their point. Contrasting fortunes for Villa new boys
Making his first Premier League appearance for Villa as a half-time substitute, since his loan move from Manchester United, Rashford wasted no time in getting the home fans off their seats, stinging Palmer's hands with a curling shot. Though Rashford will have to wait for his first Villa goal, he played a central role in Watkins' equaliser. His wonderful dead-ball strike rattled the angle of post and crossbar, with Palmer's dive leaving him powerless to react when Watkins tucked the rebound home. Fellow loanee Asensio was also thrown on by Unai Emery as Villa attempted to complete the turnaround, but the Spaniard failed to convert two big chances in the dying stages, blazing wildly over before forcing a save from the outstanding Palmer. Villa certainly emerged from the mid-season transfer window with increased depth, and Rashford's performance was a major positive here. Debut to remember for Palmer
Ipswich travelled to Villa Park on a four-match losing streak in the Premier League, having conceded a total of 14 goals in defeats to Brighton & Hove Albion, Manchester City, Liverpool and Southampton. Defensive lapses had cost Kieran McKenna's men dearly in recent weeks, and they could not afford any more mistakes on a ground where Villa had won 23 of their 38 points this year. Club reports

Ipswich travelled to Villa Park on a four-match losing streak in the Premier League, having conceded a total of 14 goals in defeats to Brighton & Hove Albion, Manchester City, Liverpool and Southampton. Defensive lapses had cost Kieran McKenna's men dearly in recent weeks, and they could not afford any more mistakes on a ground where Villa had won 23 of their 38 points this year. With Christian Walton injured and Arijanet Muric having lost the backing of McKenna, Palmer became the third goalkeeper to start a Premier League match for Ipswich in 2024/25, having arrived from West Bromwich Albion on transfer deadline day. He made six saves in a Player-of-the-Match performance, with the pick of the bunch being an acrobatic stop to deny Rogers’ deflected effort late on to preserve Ipswich’s point. Ipswich have lacked consistency between the sticks, and Palmer may have to provide just that if they are to stave off relegation. Up next for McKenna's men is a home encounter with Tottenham Hotspur.

Dean Huijsen scored the decisive goal in the 17th minute when the Spurs defence allowed the 19-year-old defender to head in unmarked from a Marcus Tavernier corner. Bournemouth leapfrogged their opponents into ninth place on 21 points, while Spurs dropped to 10th, one point behind the Cherries. How the match unfolded
Dominic Solanke had an early opportunity to hurt his former club as he capitalised on a mistake from Huijsen, only for the youngster to recover with a timely block. Solanke’s Bournemouth replacement Evanilson had an even better chance when his close-range effort was parried behind by Fraser Forster for a corner. Yet the hosts went ahead from the resultant set-piece, with Huijsen planting home a header to become Bournemouth’s youngest Premier League goalscorer. Tavernier almost turned from provider to scorer just after the half-hour, but saw a goal ruled out for offside before Forster kept out a close-range header from the midfielder on the cusp of half-time. Evanilson thought he had doubled Bournemouth’s lead when he tucked into an open goal after Tyler Adams capitalised on a blunder from Forster, but the former Porto striker was ahead of the play. Despite that, the Spanish goalkeeper had a much more comfortable evening in the Bournemouth goal than his Spurs counterpart as the visiting side failed to bypass a well-organised home defence. Huijsen headlines vibrant Bournemouth display
It was another hugely impressive display from Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth, who came into the game high on confidence following a 4-2 thrashing of Wolves in their last game. After a shaky start when he allowed Solanke in with a chance, the Spain Under-21 international, making only his third start of the season, dealt with everything thrown at him by Spurs. Meanwhile, in attack, Kluivert, the hat-trick hero from the Wolves win, looked dangerous while the lively Christie, Tavernier and Evanilson had chances to double the Cherries lead – as did substitute Dango Ouattara, who fired over in the 83rd minute. Huijsen, though, will rightly take the headlines, as Bournemouth added Spurs to their list of big Premier League scalps this season, having already claimed home wins over Arsenal and Man City.

The hosts had the chance to put the match to bed in the second half as Ryan Christie was denied by the woodwork and an Evanilson goal was disallowed for offside following a VAR review. Spurs were unable to make meaningful inroads throughout the first half and despite their performance picking up after the break, the visitors failed to find a way back and fell to their sixth league defeat of the season. Bournemouth leapfrogged their opponents into ninth place on 21 points, while Spurs dropped to 10th, one point behind the Cherries. Solanke’s Bournemouth replacement Evanilson had an even better chance when his close-range effort was parried behind by Fraser Forster for a corner. Spurs substitute Son Heung-min had a goal disallowed for offside after the break but they had Forster to thank again when he kept out Justin Kluivert’s attempt, and the frame of the goal then came to Spurs' rescue from Christie’s effort. Evanilson thought he had doubled Bournemouth’s lead when he tucked into an open goal after Tyler Adams capitalised on a blunder from Forster, but the former Porto striker was ahead of the play. Spurs, however, failed to make that slice of luck count. Spurs blow hot and cold
With a derby against Chelsea to come on Sunday, Ange Postecoglou rested Son, Pedro Porro and Timo Werner, though Spurs looked more like the side lacking a ruthless edge that were held 1-1 by Fulham last week than the extremely clinical one that dispatched Manchester City 4-0 at the Etihad Stadium, with a tame Dejan Kulusevski effort the only time Kepa Arrizabalaga was called into action before the interval. Son was finally introduced 12 minutes into the second half with Spurs on the ascendancy and had the ball in the back of the net with his first touch, only for it to be ruled out for a clear offside before James Maddison fired wide from close range and Porro’s shot from outside the box was saved by Kepa. Despite that, the Spanish goalkeeper had a much more comfortable evening in the Bournemouth goal than his Spurs counterpart as the visiting side failed to bypass a well-organised home defence. Postecoglou cut a frustrated figure at full time, and has probably been left with more questions than answers. After a shaky start when he allowed Solanke in with a chance, the Spain Under-21 international, making only his third start of the season, dealt with everything thrown at him by Spurs.

452,452,fulham,2025-02-15,"Fulham handed Nottingham Forest their second defeat in three Premier League games as they triumphed 2-1 at Craven Cottage. Calvin Bassey popped up at the far post to head home a corner that was nodded on by Raul Jimenez in the 62nd minute to hand Marco Silva’s side a deserved victory. Fulham went ahead through Emile Smith Rowe, who arrived behind Morato to head in a delightful cross from Adama Traore to open the scoring for Fulham only 15 minutes in. A change in shape midway through the second half saw Forest assert some control in the game but Fulham held on to register their third win from four league matches. Fulham, meanwhile, climbed up to eighth. How the match unfolded
Fulham made a blistering start to the game as Traore got the better of Neco Williams before firing dangerous crosses into the box – one of which was headed home by Smith Rowe for the opener. However, it was the Cottagers who were on the front foot in the second half too, as Selz was forced into another stop by Sasa Lukic before Bassey restored the hosts' lead moments later. Callum Hudson-Odoi made Bernd Leno work with a fierce strike only minutes after being introduced on one of the rare occasions the Fulham goalkeeper was tested by Forest. Silva’s side, on the other hand, created plenty of chances and Forest had Selz to thank for avoiding a heavier defeat, with the 'keeper also making a double save from substitutes Rodrigo Muniz and Harrison Reed in second-half stoppage time. Fulham do the double over Forest
Fulham’s bid to secure European football has been hampered by their poor home form, having not won any of their past five Premier League matches at Craven Cottage. But Silva said ahead of the game that Forest will have a tough task to beat a confident Fulham, and his players backed up the manager’s claims with a brilliant performance against the high-flying Forest. Fulham's bid for European football will get a boost with Jimenez getting closer to his previous best, with Crystal Palace up next. Nuno persisted with his three-man defence that had given him the 7-0 win against Brighton in their previous outing, but the visitors were under the cosh with Fulham on the ascendancy right from kick-off. It was one-way traffic up until the 37th minute when Wood, like he has done many times this season, gave Nuno’s side a lifeline as the score stayed level at half-time despite Fulham having 11 attempts, compared to Forest’s two.

The Mexican also produced a display that reminded of his days under Nuno Espirito Santo at Wolverhampton Wanderers with his effort from the edge of the box tipped behind by Selz at the half-hour mark while the Forest 'keeper also had to get low to save another of his strikes. Jimenez, who also scored the winner in the 1-0 win against Forest at City Ground earlier in the season, bagged the assist for Bassey’s winner late on. Another off day for Nuno’s Forest
Saturday’s visit to London provided Forest with a chance to consolidate their chances of a top-four finish with fourth-placed Chelsea losing at Brighton & Hove Albion on Friday, and Man City and Newcastle, below them, facing each other in a simultaneous kick-off. Nuno persisted with his three-man defence that had given him the 7-0 win against Brighton in their previous outing, but the visitors were under the cosh with Fulham on the ascendancy right from kick-off. It was one-way traffic up until the 37th minute when Wood, like he has done many times this season, gave Nuno’s side a lifeline as the score stayed level at half-time despite Fulham having 11 attempts, compared to Forest’s two. However, a comeback did not materialise for the visitors in the second half and a shift to four at the back in the final half-hour wasn’t enough to inspire the Forest side. Having also suffered a heavy 5-0 defeat to Bournemouth on 25 January, Nuno's challenge to keep his side in the top four only gets tougher with games against Newcastle and Arsenal to follow this month.

454,454,wolverhampton,2024-11-09,"Wolverhampton Wanderers earned their first Premier League win of the season and moved off the bottom of the table as they beat fellow relegation battlers Southampton 2-0 at Molineux. Pablo Sarabia scored Wolves’ fastest-ever Premier League goal to give them the breakthrough with only one minute and 48 seconds on the clock. Southampton left-back Ryan Manning had a goal overturned by the referee 10 minutes later following a VAR review, but Matheus Cunha’s stunning strike early in the second half ended hopes of a Saints comeback. Southampton continued to see more of the ball and probed for a goal, but the Wolves defence held firm to secure a crucial victory in a battle between the strugglers. The result means Wolves climb to 18th, with six points, while Southampton now occupy the bottom spot, with four points from 11 matches. How the match unfolded
Wolves made a dream start to the game as Sarabia latched on to a perfectly weighted pass from Cunha before rounding Aaron Ramsdale and slotting into an open goal inside two minutes. They were made to pay as Cunha found the top corner from 25 yards out six minutes into the second half to give the hosts a two-goal lead. Wolves breathe a sigh of relief
Wolves were made to wait until their 11th match to get the first win of the Premier League season, but it has come at a good time. Captain Mario Lemina started again after a calf problem, but it was Cunha who grabbed the headlines with a defence-splitting pass for the opener before a magnificent strike from distance that helped seal the victory. But Wolves cannot afford to be complacent as they enter a run of fixtures that could define their season, in which they face Everton, West Ham United, Ipswich Town and Leicester City before Christmas. Saints slip to the bottom
While Wolves will have their spirits up, Southampton will rue a missed opportunity as they slip to the foot of the Premier League table. Unlike Wolves, their schedule only gets tougher in the coming weeks, hosting Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur as well as making challenging trips to Brighton & Hove Albion and Aston Villa.

While Wolves will have their spirits up, Southampton will rue a missed opportunity as they slip to the foot of the Premier League table. Martin’s side had come into the fixture after a confidence-boosting win over Everton last week – their first of the campaign. Southampton, however, did not let their heads drop and Manning had the ball in the back of the net soon after, only to see it ruled out. That was as good as it got for the Saints as they fell further behind early in the second half and ended the game without a shot on target, despite seeing a major share of possession. Club reports

Although West Ham created the better chances in the end, it was a largely flat performance from Julen Lopetegui's team on Saturday. The stalemate leaves West Ham in 14th, two places above Everton, heading into the international break. How the match unfolded
Summerville was one of West Ham’s brightest attackers throughout, though he showed his defensive qualities with a fantastic block on Abdoulaye Doucoure in the ninth minute, when the Everton midfielder was through on goal. It took until two minutes before the break for the Hammers to register their first meaningful attempts as Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio were both denied by Pickford at his near post. Despite improvement from West Ham after the break, with Bowen and Guido Rodriguez probing, Fabianski had to come to their rescue when Orel Mangala picked out Lindstrom in the 61st minute. Iliman Ndiaye then saw a header comfortably gathered by Fabianski before Calvert-Lewin’s attempt was easily kept out by the West Ham goalkeeper as Everton failed to make the most of some decent openings, and their attack continues to struggle to click under Sean Dyche. Positive signs enough to ease the pressure on Lopetegui?
Despite Bowen and Antonio going close late in the first 45 minutes, Stuart Attwell’s half-time whistle led to boos echo around London Stadium from the home supporters as the Hammers failed to find a spark as they aimed to bounce back from last week’s loss to Nottingham Forest. But the hosts started on the front foot after the break, with Bowen getting in behind Jarrad Branthwaite, only to see his goalbound effort take a deflection off Tarkowski and go narrowly past Pickford’s net. Jean-Clair Todibo then almost gifted Calvert-Lewin a chance to open the scoring with a poor mistake, while Tomas Soucek diverted Vitalii Mykolenko’s fierce effort towards goal, as signs of the defensive fragility that has plagued the Hammers returned. That improved second-half display provided Lopetegui with some positives, but whether a draw will be enough to ease the pressure from fans remains to be seen. Club reports

Substitute Danny Ings, who had tested Pickford in the 87th minute, thought he had won it in the third minute of added time with a deflected attempt, but Everton’s goalkeeper produced a fine fingertip save, his sixth of the match. Pickford had been beaten earlier in the second half though, when Crysencio Summerville struck the post, after Jesper Lindstrom had seen a header kept out by Lukasz Fabianski at the other end. The stalemate leaves West Ham in 14th, two places above Everton, heading into the international break. How the match unfolded

It took until two minutes before the break for the Hammers to register their first meaningful attempts as Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio were both denied by Pickford at his near post. Ings’ attempt that bounced up off James Tarkowski seemed set to settle the contest in the closing stages, but Pickford stood firm with a save worthy of securing a share of the spoils. Pickford to the rescue, again
Everton have seen a flurry of players come and go at Goodison Park, but Pickford has remained throughout the off-field turmoil and continued to show his importance on the pitch for the Toffees. Idrissa Gueye’s dragged effort was a sign of their intent early on, and Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s loose pass moments later offered Everton a glorious chance to take the lead on the break, but both Doucoure and then Dominic Calvert-Lewin – on the rebound – fluffed their lines. Iliman Ndiaye then saw a header comfortably gathered by Fabianski before Calvert-Lewin’s attempt was easily kept out by the West Ham goalkeeper as Everton failed to make the most of some decent openings, and their attack continues to struggle to click under Sean Dyche. And the Toffees were ultimately indebted to Pickford.

458,458,fulham,2024-12-05,"Alex Iwobi was the star of the show as his brace helped Fulham to a 3-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on Thursday. Iwobi capitalised on Bart Verbruggen's early error in the fourth minute to get the home side off to a flying start at Craven Cottage. Carlos Baleba finished expertly after neat work from Joao Pedro to bring Brighton level in the 56th minute, but Matt O'Riley's own goal restored Fulham's lead. And Iwobi wrapped up the points with a lovely bending effort in the closing stages to settle an entertaining contest. Victory lifts Fulham into sixth, just a point and a place behind Brighton in a congested top half of the Premier League. How the match unfolded
Iwobi pounced on Verbruggen's sloppy pass inside the penalty area to side-foot casually home after only four minutes. Bernd Leno kept out Joao Pedro at the other end after he got in behind Calvin Bassey and Simon Adingra will feel he should have done better when shooting straight at the goalkeeper from Kaoru Mitoma's excellent low centre. Rodrigo Muniz headed agonisingly wide from Antonee Robinson's clipped cross on the stroke of half-time and Harry Wilson almost caught Brighton cold immediately from kick-off. Yet Fulham retook the lead on 79 minutes when Andreas Pereira's in-swinging corner deflected into the bottom-right corner off the unfortunate O'Riley. Iwobi then had the final say, showing neat footwork to create space in the left-hand side of the area before brilliantly curling a low strike into the far corner. Iwobi finds a way for Fulham
There might be 20 days until Christmas but Fulham were handed an early festive gift from Verbruggen that the excellent Iwobi was all too happy to receive. In truth, the early goal was at odds with a first half in which the visitors were the more forward-thinking team and Marco Silva was grateful to his goalkeeper for thwarting Adingra after 34 minutes. Fulham always carried a goal threat, though, and Muniz ought to have done better when leaping high to meet Robinson's fantastic cross from the left shortly before the break. However, there was a sense of inevitability about the equaliser, albeit it was a move right out of the very top drawer that broke Fulham's resistance. But in credit to the hosts they reset themselves well and, after a bit of fortune for their second, there was no luck involved for Iwobi's magical effort late on, which put the match well beyond the reach of Brighton. In an encounter that was so closely fought, the ex-Everton and Arsenal star – who will go up against the Gunners in Fulham’s next outing – found a way to be a difference maker for his side. Van Hecke's arrowed pass was expertly cushioned down by Joao Pedro but Baleba still had plenty to do as he cut across the ball and beyond Leno, who was at full stretch. What will not have thrilled Brighton’s boss is the way his team failed to build on the momentum thereafter, even if it was unlucky that O'Riley got the final touch from that Fulham corner. And when Iwobi's brilliant third went in, you feel Hurzeler will have been scratching his head at just how this match got away from Brighton – who have still yet to beat Fulham in nine Premier League meetings.

But in credit to the hosts they reset themselves well and, after a bit of fortune for their second, there was no luck involved for Iwobi's magical effort late on, which put the match well beyond the reach of Brighton. Head-scratcher for Hurzeler
Fabian Hurzeler will have been frustrated by Brighton's early blunder but, given he does like to encourage his team to play from the back, will probably forgive his goalkeeper’s mistake. Indeed, it will likely have irritated the Brighton head coach more that despite some fantastic patterns of play, his side struggled to make the most of the opportunities they carved out in an opening 45 minutes full of enterprise but lacking in conviction. Having survived a couple more scares, though, Hurzeler – watching from the stands as he served a one-match touchline ban – will have been thrilled with the class the Seagulls displayed to equalise. Van Hecke's arrowed pass was expertly cushioned down by Joao Pedro but Baleba still had plenty to do as he cut across the ball and beyond Leno, who was at full stretch.

Southampton remain rooted to the bottom of the table, 10 points adrift of safety, while the Cherries move up to fifth in the table, just one point behind fourth-place Manchester City. Just before half-time, Aaron Ramsdale made a smart stop to deny Ouattara as the Cherries continued to turn the screw, while Sulemana scuffed Southampton’s best chance wide at the other end. The Saints continued to improve though, halving the advantage as the dangerous Sulemana took Paul Onuachu’s layoff in stride to drill home a powerful effort. Saints’ misery continues despite admirable second half
Any momentum taken from Ivan Juric’s first win as manager away to Ipswich Town was extinguished with last weekend’s FA Cup fourth-round defeat to Championship side Burnley, and Southampton’s latest defeat at home only compounds a season of struggles. Christie was afforded too much time to deliver the cross for the first goal while a wayward pass from Jan Bednarek just outside his own penalty area resulted in the Scotsman putting the game beyond the Saints after just 16 minutes. Substitute Tyler Dibling was at the centre of their most promising attacks, and Sulemana also carried a threat, capping his display with a fine goal to hand the Saints a lifeline. Southampton must take encouragement from that battling second-half display when they host another south-coast rival next weekend, as Brighton & Hove Albion visit St Mary’s. They struggled to get going during the initial stages, but once they took a quick two-goal lead, the Cherries controlled the majority of the match, while also defending admirably during a period of sustained Southampton pressure in the second half.

How the match unfolded
Neither side asserted themselves in the opening exchanges, but Bournemouth took the lead with their first opportunity, Ouattara glancing home from yards out after a superb cross down the left by Christie. Just before half-time, Aaron Ramsdale made a smart stop to deny Ouattara as the Cherries continued to turn the screw, while Sulemana scuffed Southampton’s best chance wide at the other end. However, they were punished as they continued to throw bodies forward, as a Cherries breakaway saw Tavernier bend one past Ramsdale to end the contest. They did start the match with purpose, restricting Bournemouth to little time on the ball when they tried to create openings but poor errors at the back – a main feature of their season – led to them going behind early on and ultimately giving themselves too much to do. Bournemouth reach new heights
Bournemouth put their defeat to Premier League leaders Liverpool behind them with an impressive FA Cup fourth-round win over Everton last weekend, and they back that up with another fine display on their travels here. They struggled to get going during the initial stages, but once they took a quick two-goal lead, the Cherries controlled the majority of the match, while also defending admirably during a period of sustained Southampton pressure in the second half. Andoni Iraola’s side are now within touching distance of the top four, leapfrogging Chelsea and Newcastle United thanks to this victory, but there was more to celebrate for the manager. After weeks of injury troubles, Bournemouth were bolstered by the return of players from injury layoffs as Alex Scott and Luis Sinisterra were both back in the squad and got vital minutes under their belts. Bournemouth now host Wolverhampton Wanderers next weekend as they continue their quest for European football for the first time in their history.

462,462,west-ham-united,2025-02-15,"Kevin Schade scored the only goal as Brentford edged West Ham United 1-0 at London Stadium. West Ham were much improved after the break, but were unable to find an equaliser and are now without a win in four league matches. The Hammers remain in 16th place and 10 points above the relegation zone, while Thomas Frank’s side stay 11th but move to within three points of the top half. How the match unfolded
Brentford opened the scoring in the fourth minute when Mbeumo won an aerial battle with Emerson to release Schade. Although Alphonse Areola denied him twice – scrambling to claw off the line after the initial effort looped towards goal – the forward’s second attempt was over the line before it was pushed away. Mbeumo’s fierce low drive forced a smart reaction save from Areola in the 21st minute, while the offside flag denied Wissa soon after. Graham Potter shuffled his pack at half-time with a triple substitution and his players appeared rejuvenated at the restart, with Mohammad Kudus firing a decent opportunity over from Evan Ferguson’s cross. The Hammers continued to threaten, with the returning Lucas Paqueta firing narrowly wide and Ferguson seeing a low drive held, but the equaliser did not arrive and it spelt a third defeat in four games. West Ham were without a win in three matches and that lack of momentum was evident as Brentford settled the quicker of the two sides. West Ham's winless streak continues
The Hammers’ vulnerability on the counter was exposed inside only three-and-a-half minutes, despite the best efforts of Areola to keep out Schade. West Ham, who had failed to win any of their previous 13 Premier League games this season when conceding the opening goal, were unable to respond as Brentford continued to apply the pressure and look to extend their lead. The hosts had a combination of Areola, the woodwork and offside flag to thank for not trailing by more goals at half-time, while Konstantinos Mavropanos also made a brilliant last-ditch intervention to deny Wissa. Potter managed to tame Brentford’s threat with his triple change at half-time, introducing Ferguson, James Ward-Prowse and Ollie Scarles. Ferguson was involved immediately with a strong run and cross from the right, and Kudus definitely should have done better from close range. That was as close as the Hammers came to an equaliser and, now without a win in four games, they face title contenders Arsenal next weekend. After demonstrating their attacking qualities in the opening 45 minutes, they had to show the other side of their game after the break as West Ham went in search of the equaliser. But aside from Kudus’s chance, the Brentford defence was generally in control and their advantage never really appeared under too much threat. Club reports

463,463,brentford,2025-02-15,"Kevin Schade scored the only goal as Brentford edged West Ham United 1-0 at London Stadium. The German forward’s early strike proved decisive for the Bees, who recorded a third straight Premier League away win for the first time. Schade netted the decisive goal after just four minutes, while Yoane Wissa was twice denied by the offside flag before half-time. The Hammers remain in 16th place and 10 points above the relegation zone, while Thomas Frank’s side stay 11th but move to within three points of the top half. How the match unfolded
Brentford opened the scoring in the fourth minute when Mbeumo won an aerial battle with Emerson to release Schade. Mbeumo’s fierce low drive forced a smart reaction save from Areola in the 21st minute, while the offside flag denied Wissa soon after. Schade rattled the post as the Bees continued to dominate, while Wissa saw another goal ruled out for offside. West Ham were without a win in three matches and that lack of momentum was evident as Brentford settled the quicker of the two sides. West Ham, who had failed to win any of their previous 13 Premier League games this season when conceding the opening goal, were unable to respond as Brentford continued to apply the pressure and look to extend their lead. The hosts had a combination of Areola, the woodwork and offside flag to thank for not trailing by more goals at half-time, while Konstantinos Mavropanos also made a brilliant last-ditch intervention to deny Wissa. Potter managed to tame Brentford’s threat with his triple change at half-time, introducing Ferguson, James Ward-Prowse and Ollie Scarles. Bees hold on for landmark win
It was a landmark win for Brentford, as they recorded three straight Premier League away victories for the first time. The Bees were not in the best of form ahead of today’s game, with two wins from their last 11 matches in all competitions but, crucially, both of those victories had come on the road. But aside from Kudus’s chance, the Brentford defence was generally in control and their advantage never really appeared under too much threat. Club reports

464,464,crystal-palace,2025-02-15,"Carlos Alcaraz registered his first goal for Everton and claimed an assist as the Toffees ended a memorable week with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Beto put them ahead against the run of play late in the first half after Palace had missed several good opportunities and seen a Jefferson Lerma header disallowed. Jean-Philippe Mateta levelled with his 11th Premier League goal of the season early in the second half, but Flamengo loanee Alcaraz struck the winner with 10 minutes to play. They are level with 12th-placed Palace, whose goal difference is just one better. How the match unfolded
The first chance fell to Palace as Mateta bundled his way through a couple of challenges in the sixth minute, only to shoot straight at Jordan Pickford. Palace levelled just two minutes into the second half, with Guehi hooking a loose ball into the path of Mateta, who finished coolly. Palace made to rue misses
Palace entered Saturday's game in fine form, having won four of their last six Premier League matches after starting the season with just three victories in 18 outings. The Eagles had scored two goals in each of those recent victories, but their clinical edge deserted them in the first half of this match, Mateta and Sarr both squandering clear-cut opportunities. Within 61 seconds of that latter miss, Palace were caught short at the back. Oliver Glasner's half-time introductions of fit-again duo Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze gave Palace more control, and the Eagles might feel a point was the least they deserved from this game. However, they failed to build on the momentum generated by Mateta's equaliser, and their defending for Alcaraz's winner was suspect. Glasner will view this result as a missed opportunity, with Palace having been on the front foot against tiring opponents at 1-1. Everton relied on a mixture of good fortune and strong goalkeeping from Pickford before ruthlessly punishing Palace's first mistake to open the scoring. When Palace levelled, Everton – four days on from a workmanlike performance against the league leaders – could have settled for a point. Club reports

465,465,everton,2025-02-15,"Carlos Alcaraz registered his first goal for Everton and claimed an assist as the Toffees ended a memorable week with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Having earned a point against Liverpool via James Tarkowski's 98th-minute stunner on Wednesday, Everton arrived in south London in buoyant mood. How the match unfolded
The first chance fell to Palace as Mateta bundled his way through a couple of challenges in the sixth minute, only to shoot straight at Jordan Pickford. Marc Guehi drew a reflex save from Pickford in the 19th minute, but the Everton goalkeeper was rooted when Lerma headed into the top-right corner moments later. Ismaila Sarr then rattled the crossbar from close range after a strong run from Chris Richards, and Everton swiftly punished that miss. Jesper Lindstrom worked Dean Henderson as the game became stretched, and it was Everton who provided the final twist, Alcaraz stroking home after Will Hughes had blocked Ashley Young's drive. More positives for Moyes
After Wednesday's dramatic derby draw with Liverpool, Moyes was asked if it was his job to keep Everton's players and supporters grounded. ""Isn't it nice to have some positive talk around Everton for a change?"" was the Scot's blunt response, signalling his intention to maintain the feel-good factor produced by Tarkowski's midweek heroics. Everton relied on a mixture of good fortune and strong goalkeeping from Pickford before ruthlessly punishing Palace's first mistake to open the scoring. When Palace levelled, Everton – four days on from a workmanlike performance against the league leaders – could have settled for a point. That made the former Southampton man just the seventh player to score and assist on his first Premier League start for Everton, who appear rejuvenated one month into Moyes' second spell. Club reports

466,466,crystal-palace,2024-11-09,"Emile Smith Rowe and Harry Wilson were on target in either half as Fulham triumphed 2-0 against 10-man Crystal Palace on Saturday. Croydon-born Smith Rowe broke the deadlock in first-half stoppage time, taking Raul Jimenez’s pass into his stride before finishing past Dean Henderson at Selhurst Park. This second consecutive win in a London derby propelled Marco Silva's side into sixth place, among a cluster of teams on 18 points – 11 more than Oliver Glasner's team, who remain 17th in the table. Henderson produced another impressive stop to keep out Alex Iwobi’s fierce volley, though Joachim Andersen was required to clear Jean-Philippe Mateta’s header off the line at the other end. Andersen's intervention proved crucial on the stroke of half-time when Lacroix’s loose pass led to Jimenez feeding Smith Rowe in the second minute of stoppage time, with Henderson only able to parry the shot into the bottom-right corner. Palace’s quest for an equaliser became more difficult from the 76th minute, when Kamada was dismissed for a high challenge on Tete. Palace's unbeaten streak halted
The home side appeared to be heading in the right direction, having avoided defeat in each of their three previous matches across all competitions. Without the likes of Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton, Eddie Nketiah and Jefferson Lerma, Glasner was forced to rotate his starting line-up. The Palace boss gave a Premier League debut to Justin Devenny, in the absence of the suspended Will Hughes, and the 21-year-old acquitted himself well in the middle of the park. Palace had failed to win any of their nine previous Premier League games when conceding first, and they struggled to create chances for an equaliser after the break. Their opponents capitalised on the dismissal to put the contest to bed and Palace will now head into the international break nervously looking over their shoulder, with 18th-placed Wolves now just one point behind following their win over Southampton. The Cottagers did have Andersen to thank on his first return to Selhurst Park since his August transfer from Palace, with the defender thwarting Mateta's goal-bound prod. Club reports

Wilson, Fulham's two-goal hero against Brentford on Monday, made sure of all three points with seven minutes remaining, before he had an injury-time effort disallowed. This second consecutive win in a London derby propelled Marco Silva's side into sixth place, among a cluster of teams on 18 points – 11 more than Oliver Glasner's team, who remain 17th in the table. How the match unfolded
Fulham dominated the opening stages as Reiss Nelson was denied by Henderson, while Maxence Lacroix’s well-timed sliding challenge stopped Smith Rowe soon after. Henderson produced another impressive stop to keep out Alex Iwobi’s fierce volley, though Joachim Andersen was required to clear Jean-Philippe Mateta’s header off the line at the other end. Smith Rowe thought he had doubled the visitors’ lead when he swept home Iwobi’s cross on 52 minutes, but his goal was overturned following a VAR review. The Cottagers capitalised on their numerical advantage as Wilson latched onto Iwobi’s sublime through ball and slotted home, before the forward had another strike overturned by the VAR. 99 compared to Fulham’s 0. Fulham make top-four surge
Only goal difference is keeping Fulham outside the top four, and they will remain in sixth place if Aston Villa lose at Liverpool in Saturday's late fixture. Fresh from their best start to a Premier League season in 21 years – 15 points from ten games – Silva’s side looked confident and threatening every time they went forward. The Cottagers did have Andersen to thank on his first return to Selhurst Park since his August transfer from Palace, with the defender thwarting Mateta's goal-bound prod. However, Fulham certainly made the most of that let-off when breaking at pace with their counter-attacking move culminating in Smith Rowe's driven finish. Fulham’s advantage never truly looked under threat from then on, and it looked more than likely they would double their lead, doing so thanks to a familiar hero. Wilson may have counted himself unlucky to be on the bench again as Silva opted for an unchanged side, but once again he proved his worth from the bench here. The Wales forward grasped his opportunity with a well-taken goal to wrap up the victory, and will hope that earns him a start when Fulham resume after the international break with a home game against Wolves.

It was another high-scoring Premier League affair for Thomas Frank’s side at home, though they had to work hard for the three points after Evanilson profited from a mistake to open the scoring for the visitors early in the first half. Wissa equalised with a header before the break, and when Justin Kluivert restored Bournemouth's lead in the second half, Mikkel Damsgaard got the Bees back on level terms again, just one minute and 20 seconds later. Wissa delivered the winner nine minutes later with a lovely dink to get the Bees back to winning ways after their heartbreaking late defeat to Fulham on Monday. Brentford leapfrog their opponents into 10th on 16 points, with Andoni Iraola’s side one point and a place behind. Ten minutes later, the hosts were back on level terms as Wissa nodded back across goal into the far-bottom corner after a throw-in was flicked on. Their lead lasted just 80 seconds, as Bryan Mbeumo slotted in Damsgaard, who squeezed the ball in from a tight angle on the right. Brentford took the lead for the first time in the 58th minute as Wissa latched on to Vitaly Janelt’s curling pass and delightfully lifted it over Kepa. Goals galore for Brentford
The hosts have failed to keep a clean sheet this season, but they guarantee entertainment, having scored 12 goals in their last three home matches. Bournemouth’s first came down to some Brentford sloppiness. Brentford, of course, had a response up their sleeve as a spritely Wissa was in position to benefit from the chaos caused by an old-fashioned long throw into the box. But for all of their great play in the final third, the Bees were left lacking at the back for Bournemouth’s second goal as well, as the visitors capitalised on Mbeumo’s lax marking during a brilliantly worked corner. Evanilson contributed his third goal in the same number of games as he proved a vital part of Bournemouth’s brilliant start at the Gtech Community Stadium. In behind the Brentford defence, he drove to the right of Flekken before dragging the ball back to his left to sit the Dutch goalkeeper down. Club reports

An unmarked Marcos Senesi scooped an early big chance over the bar from close range for Bournemouth, but his blushes were spared moments later as Evanilson latched on to a slack backpass from Sepp van den Berg to slot in the opener. Kluivert put Bournemouth ahead once more just after the start of the second half with a lovely move from a corner, playing a one-two with Lewis Cook to work the space to fire home. Bournemouth were millimetres from an equaliser in the final minute as Enes Unal’s header hit the crossbar, but they could not claw their way back. Bournemouth’s first came down to some Brentford sloppiness. Van den Berg paid no attention to the pressure of Evanilson as he curled a slow and short back pass towards his goalkeeper and saw the prolific Bournemouth striker nick possession and finish with flair. But for all of their great play in the final third, the Bees were left lacking at the back for Bournemouth’s second goal as well, as the visitors capitalised on Mbeumo’s lax marking during a brilliantly worked corner. Evanilson a bright spark in defeat
The Cherries saw a brilliant run, including victories over Manchester City and Arsenal, come to an end in west London, but for their star striker, the form continued. Evanilson contributed his third goal in the same number of games as he proved a vital part of Bournemouth’s brilliant start at the Gtech Community Stadium. Evanilson might not have been decisive on this occasion, but Iraola will be pleased to see his form continue as Bournemouth look to bounce back next time out against Brighton & Hove Albion.

The Seagulls went ahead in the 27th minute when Kaoru Mitoma sensationally plucked Bart Verbruggen’s ball out of the sky before placing it beyond Filip Jorgensen’s grasp. Brighton move up two places into eighth ahead of the rest of the weekend’s action. How the match unfolded
A moment of individual brilliance handed Brighton the lead, with Mitoma exquisitely bringing down Verbruggen’s long punt forward before curling the ball into the bottom-right corner. Brighton doubled their advantage just before the break; Levi Colwill almost turned the ball into his own net, with the rebound falling to Danny Welbeck, who laid off for Minteh to finish. Brighton, not content with their three-goal lead, could have added a fourth, with Mitoma seeing his effort saved before Veltman’s strike was pushed onto the post by Jorgensen. Sensational Seagulls respond in style
Despite beating Chelsea in the FA Cup in their last competitive match, Brighton were still licking their wounds from their humiliating 7-0 thrashing at Nottingham Forest. Though taking their time to make their mark in the match, with their opponents dominating the ball early on, Brighton remained defensively astute but ruthless in attack, as was evident in Mitoma’s bolt from the blue to open the scoring. Minteh then handed Brighton a two-goal cushion, and though they led at the break, the hosts would have been worried, having only won one of their last five Premier League matches when ahead at half-time. After edging further ahead through Minteh once again, Brighton should have increased their lead, with Mitoma squandering a golden opportunity when one-on-one, while substitute Joao Pedro could only fire over after being presented with the ball from Jorgensen’s poor clearance. Brighton are now within touching distance of the European places and will be confident of moving further up the table with a trip to struggling Southampton on 22 February. Club reports

Despite beating Chelsea in the FA Cup in their last competitive match, Brighton were still licking their wounds from their humiliating 7-0 thrashing at Nottingham Forest. However, their display against the Blues further proved their credentials for finishing in the European places this season. Their advantage never looked likely to be clawed back by Chelsea though. Blues struggle without Jackson
Chelsea’s inconsistent form of late continued on the south coast, with the absence of some of their most potent attackers pivotal in their display on Friday. With the news that Nicolas Jackson would be sidelined for six weeks with a hamstring injury, Maresca chose to play Cole Palmer in a fluid forward role alongside Christopher Nkunku, with the England international firing the game's first effort wildly over the crossbar early on after Malo Gusto’s bursting run. Chelsea’s injury woes worsened around the 20-minute mark when Noni Madueke pulled up following a break down their right, a change that saw Jadon Sancho introduced and Palmer moved back into midfield, yet the Blues’ talisman still proved ineffective. After failing to register a shot on target, Chelsea trailed at half-time of a Premier League match by two goals for the first time under Maresca, who will have been urging his team to respond. The Blues travel to Aston Villa next Saturday and will be hoping to solve their issues in front of goal. Club reports

472,472,manchester-united,2024-12-07,"Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United fell to their second straight defeat in the Premier League after losing 3-2 to Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford. Nikola Milenkovic gave the visitors a dream start, heading in a corner in the second minute but Rasmus Hojlund brought United back on level terms 16 minutes later. After Jota Silva and Bruno Fernandes were denied by the woodwork at either end, Morgan Gibbs-White put Forest ahead again two minutes after the restart with a shot that too easily beat Andre Onana before Chris Wood’s header doubled the visiting side’s advantage. United captain Fernandes then pulled one back for the hosts just past the hour mark, but their attempts to find an equaliser did not bear fruit. With the hard-fought victory, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side climb to fifth with 25 points from 15 matches while United are 13th with 19 points, their lowest position after 15 league matches since 1986/87. But United recovered from the early setback and asserted control, levelling the square through Hojlund in the 18th minute. Manuel Ugarte played a defence-splitting pass for Alejandro Garnacho, whose initial effort was saved by Matz Sels only for the Danish striker to score on the rebound. The visitors almost regained the lead nine minutes later when Jota Silva hit the woodwork following a set-piece before United captain Fernandes' free-kick was tipped onto the bar by Sels four minutes before the break. Forest began the second half like they did the first, as Gibbs-White’s low drive from the edge of the box wrongfooted Andre Onana, possibly with the help of Storm Darragh. Fernandes gave United hopes of a comeback when he beat Sels from outside the box following a cutback from Amad, but the Forest defence held firm to take home all three points. United shaky at the back again
After another setback, United have only won one of Amorim’s first four Premier League games in charge – a 4-0 defeat of Everton at the start of the month. Amorim handed Leny Yoro his full debut as United made five changes from the side that lost 2-0 to Arsenal on Wednesday, including the return of Martinez and Kobbie Mainoo from suspension. Onana’s error allowed the visitors to pull ahead again and their defending for Forest’s eventual winner also left a lot to be desired. With his first Manchester derby coming next Sunday, Amorim will need to find solutions fast if he is to solve United’s issues. Forest captain Ryan Yates put in an excellent shift as he stuck to Fernandes whenever his United counterpart was in possession, but it was Wood who proved to be the matchwinner. Club reports

473,473,nottingham-forest,2024-12-07,"Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United fell to their second straight defeat in the Premier League after losing 3-2 to Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford. After Jota Silva and Bruno Fernandes were denied by the woodwork at either end, Morgan Gibbs-White put Forest ahead again two minutes after the restart with a shot that too easily beat Andre Onana before Chris Wood’s header doubled the visiting side’s advantage. It was Wood's 25th top-flight goal for Forest, making the New Zealander his club's leading Premier League goalscorer ahead of Bryan Roy. With the hard-fought victory, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side climb to fifth with 25 points from 15 matches while United are 13th with 19 points, their lowest position after 15 league matches since 1986/87. How the match unfolded
Forest came out fast, taking the lead just 91 seconds after kick-off as Milenkovic won his battle with Lisandro Martinez to head home an Elliot Anderson corner. Forest began the second half like they did the first, as Gibbs-White’s low drive from the edge of the box wrongfooted Andre Onana, possibly with the help of Storm Darragh. Wood’s looping header from a Gibbs-White cross then made it 3-1 with fewer than 10 minutes played in the second period. Fernandes gave United hopes of a comeback when he beat Sels from outside the box following a cutback from Amad, but the Forest defence held firm to take home all three points. Onana’s error allowed the visitors to pull ahead again and their defending for Forest’s eventual winner also left a lot to be desired. Wood stars for Forest again
Forest were beaten fair and square by Manchester City on Wednesday, but Espirito Santo will be happy to return home with three points in the bag after a double-header in Manchester. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anderson returned to the starting line-up and bagged assists as Forest made quick starts to both the halves. Forest captain Ryan Yates put in an excellent shift as he stuck to Fernandes whenever his United counterpart was in possession, but it was Wood who proved to be the matchwinner. Having just aimed to avoid relegation during the last two campaigns, things are looking up for Forest this time around and they trail fourth-placed City by just two points. Club reports

Oliver Glasner’s side started the match fast and were quickly rewarded, with Munoz latching onto Will Hughes’ fine through-ball and firing beyond Stefan Ortega to put his side in front after four minutes. But City hit back again midway through the second period when Bernardo Silva teed up Lewis to curl into the top corner for his first goal of the season and for the first time since 6 April 2024, which was also against Palace. Palace back at it
While Palace lost the lead twice, this performance was the latest indicator that they have recovered from their early-season wobble. They ended last season brilliantly under Glasner but drew three and lost five of their first eight matches of this campaign, leaving them in trouble at the bottom of the table. Hughes was impressive in midfield, never giving City a moment to settle and teeing up both of Palace’s goals. Eberechi Eze also provided some lovely moments as he continued to move through the gears since his return from injury at the end of November, while Jean-Philippe Mateta and Sarr were a threat to City’s backline. The champions’ back four was totally pulled apart as Munoz scored Palace’s first, while Lacroix was given too much time to head home the second from a corner. Guardiola’s system has been designed to avoid giving away counter-attacks, but they gave up a number of big chances from those situations at Selhurst Park. Club reports

475,475,manchester-city,2024-12-07,"Crystal Palace and Manchester City played out an entertaining 2-2 draw at Selhurst Park that extended the reigning champions’ winless away run to four league matches. The hosts caused Pep Guardiola’s side plenty of problems and merited a point that continues their recent upturn in form. Daniel Munoz gave the hosts the lead inside four minutes before Erling Haaland equalised before half-time. Following the draw, Manchester City remain fourth in the Premier League, eight points behind leaders Liverpool. An end-to-end encounter presented both sides with chances, Ismaila Sarr and Jefferson Lerma squandering openings for the hosts, while Haaland and Ilkay Gundogan went close for Man City. The visitors did equalise in the 31st minute, when Matheus Nunes’ arcing cross wasn’t dealt with by Marc Guehi or Dean Henderson and Haaland took advantage to score his 13th league goal of the season, which takes him level with Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. But City hit back again midway through the second period when Bernardo Silva teed up Lewis to curl into the top corner for his first goal of the season and for the first time since 6 April 2024, which was also against Palace. City finally grasped control of the game and did look the more likely to pinch a third, with both Savinho and Haaland threatening. Hughes was impressive in midfield, never giving City a moment to settle and teeing up both of Palace’s goals. Eberechi Eze also provided some lovely moments as he continued to move through the gears since his return from injury at the end of November, while Jean-Philippe Mateta and Sarr were a threat to City’s backline. De Bruyne can’t mask defensive deficiencies
City couldn’t exert the control they needed over this match, but it is clear the return of Kevin De Bruyne is improving their attacking play. The Belgian was involved in two of his team’s best moments in the first half, sliding Haaland in on goal for his early chance before nearly teeing up the Norwegian again with a low cross. But the impact of their talismanic midfielder was not enough to mask the familiar defensive frailties that are plaguing City’s title defence.

The early weeks of Enzo Maresca's tenure have been full of promise for Chelsea, but there remains a nagging sense that his side are still waiting on a statement victory. Chelsea's last three Premier League defeats have all come against last season's top three teams in Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool, yet they are unbeaten in 21 matches against all other opponents. Moises Caicedo only needed four minutes to level when Bruno Fernandes' penalty put Chelsea on the back foot at Manchester United a week ago, and just 10 minutes elapsed between Martinelli's opener and Neto's excellent equaliser here – the winger’s first top-flight goal for the Blues. Maresca still has work to do in defence – Chelsea have now conceded at least once in all six of their home league games under him. However, few could deny that Chelsea's battling display warranted a point, and with seven of their next 10 league opponents currently sitting in the bottom half, they will be confident of building some momentum in the coming weeks. Rice's rapid thinking almost led to the opener when he threaded a quick free-kick through the Chelsea backline for Havertz to convert, only for the German to be ruled offside. Match reports

477,477,arsenal,2024-11-10,"Arsenal's winless run extended to four matches after a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Having lost two of their last three league games, Mikel Arteta's Gunners entered Sunday's match 10 points adrift of leaders Liverpool and in need of a victory. And Arsenal were en route to claiming that win when Gabriel Martinelli – assisted by fit-again captain Martin Odegaard – struck on the hour-mark. Leandro Trossard failed to capitalise on a brilliant opportunity with the last kick of the game, meaning Arsenal sit fourth, with Chelsea above them on goal difference in third. Robert Sanchez denied Martinelli at his near post, then Chelsea received a huge reprieve in the 34th minute. Kai Havertz latched onto Declan Rice's quick free-kick to prod home, but the on-field decision to award the goal was overturned following a VAR review for offside. Wesley Fofana went close shortly after the interval, but Arsenal inched ahead on the hour-mark, Martinelli side-footing home after being picked out by Odegaard. Arsenal went agonisingly close to a dramatic winner deep in stoppage time, but Trossard – who had the unmarked Havertz lingering behind him – turned William Saliba’s inviting cross wide. Chelsea's last three Premier League defeats have all come against last season's top three teams in Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool, yet they are unbeaten in 21 matches against all other opponents. While they fell short of a first win over Arsenal since August 2021, Maresca will be delighted by the fight they showed after falling behind to a Gunners side finally back at full strength. Moises Caicedo only needed four minutes to level when Bruno Fernandes' penalty put Chelsea on the back foot at Manchester United a week ago, and just 10 minutes elapsed between Martinelli's opener and Neto's excellent equaliser here – the winger’s first top-flight goal for the Blues. His team were saved by a VAR review when they fell asleep in the first half, then Levi Colwill was at fault as he played Martinelli onside for Arsenal's opener. Odegaard return not enough
Perhaps for the first time since an eighth-place finish in his first full season in charge in 2020/21, Arsenal boss Arteta was facing scrutiny as his team travelled across London. Defeats at Bournemouth and Newcastle United had left them well adrift in the title race despite the struggles of champions Manchester City, with Liverpool opening a 10-point gap to the Gunners by impressively beating Aston Villa 2-0 on Saturday. The returns of Odegaard – making his first league appearance since the 1-1 draw with Brighton on 31 August – and Rice, who sat out Wednesday's UEFA Champions League defeat to Internazionale Milano, sparked an improvement. Rice's rapid thinking almost led to the opener when he threaded a quick free-kick through the Chelsea backline for Havertz to convert, only for the German to be ruled offside. Odegaard, meanwhile, recorded his eighth open-play assist in the Premier League in 2024 when he picked out Martinelli. Having his captain back will be a huge boost for Arteta. However, Arsenal never truly felt in control and after a couple of close calls, it was no surprise when Neto wiped out their advantage. The sight of Arteta rolling around on the turf in disbelief after Trossard failed to tap home Saliba’s stoppage-time cross could be a memorable one come the end of the season. Winless in four league games and with Nottingham Forest up next after the international break, Arsenal may need a faultless festive period if they are to claw their way into title contention.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s 74th-minute own goal proved decisive, as he inadvertently turned Cole Palmer's cross over Alphonse Areola with an attempted clearance. Graham Potter’s return to Stamford Bridge had started well, Jarrod Bowen profiting from Levi Colwill’s slack pass to give them the lead three minutes before the break. However, Chelsea substitute Pedro Neto levelled the score in the 64th minute before Palmer forced the winner 10 minutes later. Chelsea move up to fourth on 43 points after recording back-to-back home wins, while West Ham remain 15th on 27. How the match unfolded
The Blues dominated the early stages with little reward. Noni Madueke whipped a shot wide after a blistering counter-attack before teeing up Enzo Fernandez shortly after, though he drilled his effort wide of the far post. Palmer almost restored parity in first-half stoppage time, lifting a free-kick from just outside the box towards the top-right corner, only for Areola to brilliantly tip the ball over the crossbar. Neto’s introduction sparked Chelsea to life, though. Mohammed Kudus headed against the far post shortly after and it was a costly miss, as Palmer’s clever footwork saw him open up space on the left of the box, with Wan-Bissaka unlucky to get the telling touch to lift it over the goalkeeper. Blues back to winning ways
Enzo Maresca said it was no coincidence that Chelsea’s form had dipped during the transfer window due to uncertainty, and with its imminent closure, the Blues appeared to get back on track. But Maresca was again left to rue individual mistakes in the first half, even if Chelsea responded well to going behind. Those substitutions also appeared to free up Palmer in a more fluid style. While Maresca still has issues to address, Chelsea have won two of their last three league matches ahead of their FA Cup and Premier League double-header away to Brighton & Hove Albion. An unhappy return
Stamford Bridge has not been a happy hunting ground for former Chelsea managers in the past, and Potter was the latest to endure a frustrating return to west London. They had to bide their time in the first half as Chelsea kept the ball in the opening stages but eventually, chances came – Bowen and Kudus were both denied by Jorgensen while Andy Irving volleyed just over the bar. However, with a lead to protect after the break, they sat deeper as Chelsea’s substitutes started to dictate the match, and they were duly punished by Neto for not clearing their lines. Club reports

Mohammed Kudus headed against the far post shortly after and it was a costly miss, as Palmer’s clever footwork saw him open up space on the left of the box, with Wan-Bissaka unlucky to get the telling touch to lift it over the goalkeeper. A slow start to the second half prompted Maresca into more changes, introducing Neto, Marc Guiu and Christopher Nkunku, with the Portuguese injecting some much-needed pace on the wing – his whipped delivery caused chaos in the West Ham box before he scored. West Ham had been boosted by the arrival of Evan Ferguson on loan from Brighton earlier on Monday, and there was more good news for Hammers fans as Bowen was named in the starting line-up after recovering from a foot injury. They had to bide their time in the first half as Chelsea kept the ball in the opening stages but eventually, chances came – Bowen and Kudus were both denied by Jorgensen while Andy Irving volleyed just over the bar. Bowen could not have asked for an easier chance to mark his return with a goal either as he neatly profited off Colwill’s pass, much to the defender’s chagrin. After striking the post, Kudus almost grabbed a stoppage-time equaliser, but was thwarted by Tosin Adarabioyo’s last-ditch challenge, leaving West Ham with work to do before they host Brentford.

Four first-half goals kept fans at the Gtech Community Stadium on the edge of their seats as Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa's efforts were cancelled out by quickfire equalisers from Alexander Isak and Harvey Barnes. The chances flowed at both ends in the second half, but it was Brentford who seized their opportunity to rack up another three points. Thomas Frank's team remain unbeaten on home soil this season and now sit seventh in the table, while Newcastle remain 12th and are without a victory in four league games. Mbeumo got the ball rolling for the hosts after eight minutes, stepping inside Lewis Hall to fire home, before Isak stooped to nod Newcastle level three minutes later. That set the tone for an engaging battle, with Isak denied by a sprawling Mark Flekken, before Wissa pounced on a loose pass from Barnes to fire the Bees back in front after 28 minutes. However, Brentford's lead lasted just four minutes this time, as more static defending allowed Barnes to make it 2-2, before Jacob Murphy frustratingly headed over with the goal gaping. Brentford settled quicker after the restart, with Nick Pope diverting Wissa's strike onto the post before Collins stole in behind Newcastle's defence to steer home after 56 minutes. Home is where the heart is
One of the quirks of Brentford's season so far has been the wild contrast between their home and away form in the Premier League. This win against Newcastle brings the Bees up to 22 home points gained so far in 2024/25 - more than any other top-flight side - with seven wins and one draw from eight matches at the Gtech Community Stadium. However, given the congested nature of this Premier League campaign, the Bees' outstanding form on home soil could be enough to have them dreaming of a push for Europe. No Brentford player enjoys his outings at the Gtech more than Wissa. Nottingham Forest will become the final team to visit the Gtech in the Premier League this calendar year on 21 December, after Frank's men go to Chelsea for a west London Derby next Sunday. His first-half goal came between two wasted openings and his defensive work fell glaringly short in the build-up to Wissa's goal, the Brentford man taking in his slack pass before advancing into the area and rifling home.

His goal against the Magpies was his eighth home goal of the campaign from nine scored overall, and he has now netted in seven home league games in a row. Howe's decision to utilise Barnes on the left of the Magpies frontline, alongside Isak and Murphy, came as part of a plan to rotate Gordon. However, Barnes grew quiet in the second half and it was no surprise to see Gordon introduced when the Magpies went in search of a third equaliser late on – a hunt in which they ultimately fell short. Gordon's dynamism in one-on-one situations remains a key aspect of Newcastle's strategy and Barnes still has plenty of work to do to nail down a starting spot. With his former club Leicester visiting St James' Park next week, Barnes will hope for another opportunity to impress. Club reports

482,482,brentford,2025-02-02,"Tottenham Hotspur ended their Premier League seven-match winless run with a 2-0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium. Pape Sarr sealed the points in the 87th minute, moments after Djed Spence cleared off the line from Fabio Carvalho, condemning Thomas Frank’s side to a fifth defeat in six home matches across all competitions. Spurs climb to 14th place – ahead of West Ham United with a superior goal difference – and move within four points of Brentford, who remain 11th. Brentford sought a response, with Antonin Kinsky beating away Christian Norgaard's volley, while Richarlison bravely threw himself in the way of Bryan Mbeumo's fierce strike. Yoane Wissa might have done better when presented with a great opportunity in the 53rd minute, but after meeting Mikkel Damsgaard’s cross, the forward could not keep his effort down, with the ball clipping the crossbar on its way over. Spence came to Spurs’ rescue when he hooked away Carvalho’s overhead kick, and Postecoglou’s team made sure of the result as substitute Sarr latched onto Son’s through-ball before prodding through the legs of Brentford goalkeeper Hakon Valdimarsson to seal a much-needed win. No home comforts for the Bees
No Premier League team have collected more points on home soil than Brentford this season, but Frank’s side seem to have hit a wall at the Gtech Community Stadium in recent weeks. Despite failing to win any of their last five home matcches in all competitions before this encounter, the Bees made a positive start, but without really threatening Spurs' goal. For all their positive attacking play this season, Brentford have been found wanting at the other end, and they conceded for a 14th straight home league match through Janelt’s own goal. It was only the third goal Brentford have conceded from set-pieces (excluding penalties) this season, but they responded well. However, the Wissa opportunity going begging proved crucial, as the Bees’ second-highest scorer this season was unable to apply the finishing touch to Damsgaard’s cross from right under the crossbar. However, Brentford must now look to put their troubles at home behind them by picking up form on the road – they face away matches against West Ham United and Leicester City next, with the Bees getting next weekend off due to being out of the FA Cup. Though they took the lead in fortuitous circumstances, Spurs would not have been complaining, and their dedication to the cause was epitomised by Richarlison taking Mbeumo’s powerful strike straight in the face before half-time. Spurs only registered two shots on target throughout the contest though, crucially, one of them resulted in the second goal that finally put the match beyond Brentford thanks to Sarr’s neat finish, while Postecoglou will no doubt be delighted with the work of Spence just before that, with the full-back alert when it mattered most in his own six-yard box.

483,483,tottenham-hotspur,2025-02-02,"Tottenham Hotspur ended their Premier League seven-match winless run with a 2-0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ange Postecoglou’s side halted a run of four successive league defeats to claim their first win in the competition since a 5-0 rout of Southampton on 15 December. The visitors broke the deadlock in the 29th minute when Vitaly Janelt turned Son Heung-min’s corner into his own net. Spurs climb to 14th place – ahead of West Ham United with a superior goal difference – and move within four points of Brentford, who remain 11th. How the match unfolded
Spurs carried the greater attacking threat from the start, and a sliding Richarlison could not quite connect with Dejan Kulusevski's low drive early on. But Spurs were not to be denied as Son's inswinging corner bounced in off the back of Janelt. Brentford sought a response, with Antonin Kinsky beating away Christian Norgaard's volley, while Richarlison bravely threw himself in the way of Bryan Mbeumo's fierce strike. Spence came to Spurs’ rescue when he hooked away Carvalho’s overhead kick, and Postecoglou’s team made sure of the result as substitute Sarr latched onto Son’s through-ball before prodding through the legs of Brentford goalkeeper Hakon Valdimarsson to seal a much-needed win. That assist for Son now means he has produced 69 for Spurs in the Premier League, the most of any player at the club in the competition's history. No home comforts for the Bees

However, the Wissa opportunity going begging proved crucial, as the Bees’ second-highest scorer this season was unable to apply the finishing touch to Damsgaard’s cross from right under the crossbar. Postecoglou gets back on track
With Everton continuing their resurgence on Saturday under David Moyes, the Toffees moved above Spurs, pushing them down to 16th place ahead of kick-off in west London. Postecoglou was aiming to prevent Spurs suffering a fifth straight Premier League defeat for the first time in over 20 years, and his players looked purposeful from the start. Though they took the lead in fortuitous circumstances, Spurs would not have been complaining, and their dedication to the cause was epitomised by Richarlison taking Mbeumo’s powerful strike straight in the face before half-time. Spurs only registered two shots on target throughout the contest though, crucially, one of them resulted in the second goal that finally put the match beyond Brentford thanks to Sarr’s neat finish, while Postecoglou will no doubt be delighted with the work of Spence just before that, with the full-back alert when it mattered most in his own six-yard box. After that morale-boosting victory, Postecoglou’s side switch their focus to the EFL Cup in midweek and their semi-final second leg against Liverpool; they head to Anfield with a narrow 1-0 lead.

484,484,tottenham-hotspur,2024-11-10,"Ipswich Town claimed a shock 2-1 victory at Tottenham Hotspur to end their wait for a first Premier League win of the season. Spurs, who saw a Dominic Solanke goal disallowed for handball early in the second half, were handed a lifeline when Rodrigo Bentancur headed in from a corner to cut the deficit in the 69th minute. It is a victory that takes Kieran McKenna’s side up to 17th, while Spurs are 10th, with 16 points from their 11 matches. How the match unfolded
Ipswich set the tone early on as Szmodics forced a save out of Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario inside two minutes before Cameron Burgess rattled the crossbar from a corner. Szmodics played a part in Ipswich’s second as his cross was parried by Vicario and the ball rebounded off Radu Dragusin, and Delap was on hand to prod in his sixth league goal of the season. Solanke thought he had dragged Spurs back into it in the 49th minute, but his goal was overturned following a VAR review because he had kicked the ball on to his hand while shooting. Bentancur thumped in a header from Pedro Porro’s corner, but with Muric in sharp form between the sticks, Ipswich held firm to finally get their season up and running. Tractor Boys get that long overdue win
The pressure was on for Ipswich after fellow strugglers Crystal Palace, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Southampton all got their first wins of the season in recent weeks. But Ipswich pulled off one of the shock results of the season so far and will now hope to build on the momentum after the international break, as McKenna enjoyed a happy return to the club where he came through the academy and began his coaching career (below, left) almost a decade ago. Spurs falter, again
Spurs delivered an impressive performance in beating Aston Villa last week, but questions about their consistency have lingered this season. And there was to be no such comeback this time around, as Spurs’ faltering form continued. They have now lost three fixtures when coming off the back of midweek outings in the UEFA Europa League and Ange Postecoglou’s team just could not get going after defeat to Galatasaray in Istanbul on Thursday. The Spurs head coach had kept his trust in the same 11 that fought back against Villa, but this is a worrying patch of form for Postecoglou, and his team will need to rediscover some consistency if he is to deliver UEFA Champions League football this season.

Solanke had a great chance to restore parity in stoppage time, but Arijanet Muric made a fantastic stop as Ipswich held on for a memorable triumph, securing their first win in the Premier League since April 2002.

They will next host Manchester United at Portman Road in Ruben Amorim's first match in charge of the Red Devils and will fancy their chances of giving the Portuguese a tough welcome to the Premier League.

486,486,aston-villa,2024-12-07,"Jhon Duran scored the only goal as Aston Villa edged out the Premier League's bottom side Southampton 1-0 on Saturday. The Colombian’s first-half strike was enough to seal a hard-fought win for Unai Emery’s side, who climbed to fifth in the table after back-to-back victories at Villa Park. Villa, who ended an eight-match winless streak across all competitions with victory over Brentford on Wednesday, broke through in the 24th minute through a wonderful individual goal by Duran. With Brighton and Hove Albion and Fulham not playing until Sunday, Villa leapfrog both clubs to sixth place on 25 points. Diego Carlos and Ezri Konsa thwarted Ryan Manning and Cameron Archer, while the returning Taylor Harwood-Bellis deflected Morgan Rogers' effort behind at the other end. However, Villa's number nine was not to be denied in the 24th minute, stealing possession from Harwood-Bellis and bursting away from Nathan Wood before bending the ball into the net. Wood was in the right place for the visitors on both occasions, blocking Ross Barkley’s goalbound effort from an Ollie Watkins cutback, while also getting in the way of the latter’s stoppage-time attempt. Lumley denied John McGinn from the final Villa attack, but one goal was enough for the hosts as Southampton's struggles continued. Back-to-back for Villa
Emery and Villa will have breathed a huge sigh of relief after finally ending their winless streak against Brentford in midweek. Emery included Duran from the start for the first time in the Premier League this season, with Watkins dropping to the bench despite his goal against the Bees. It was an inspired decision by the Villa boss. Villa did have opportunities to put the contest well and truly beyond Southampton later on, and their lack of a clinical edge is something Emery will be eager to address. Saints’ away struggles continue
Having lost 11 of their last 14 Premier League away games – and registered just a single point on the road this season – Southampton would not have been brimming with confidence ahead of the trip to Villa Park.

Southampton could not respond as their winless streak on the road in the top flight stretched to 15 matches. Southampton were given a scare when Joe Lumley's loose pass was intercepted, but the goalkeeper atoned for his error by blocking Duran's effort. While Southampton failed to register a single shot on target in the entire game, the hosts went close to doubling their lead late on.

488,488,manchester-united,2025-02-02,"Jean-Philippe Mateta was the hero for Crystal Palace as his brace earned a 2-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Mateta then made sure of the points with one minute remaining, neatly slotting Daniel Munoz’s low cross past Andre Onana to finish off a blistering counter-attack. Kobbie Mainoo had struck a post early in the match for United, though the hosts looked unlikely to trouble Palace, who defended staunchly throughout. Palace leapfrog United in the table, moving up to 12th on 30 points, while Ruben Amorim’s side now sit one point and one place below them. How the match unfolded
United made a bright start, with Mainoo seeing a deflected bouncing drive tipped onto a post by goalkeeper Dean Henderson seven minutes in. Mateta looked to have found the breakthrough shortly before half-time, bursting through 1v1, but Onana tipped his dinked effort wide of the far post. Henderson was again called into action early in the second half, pushing Bruno Fernandes’s strike wide before getting down to hold onto Manuel Ugarte’s low half-volley minutes later. United pushed bodies forward late on in search of an equaliser and were punished on the break, with Munoz putting it on a plate for Mateta to help it past Onana. United stumble again
It was a familiar story for Man Utd in many ways as not for the first time under Amorim, they struggled to find their finishing touch despite carving out some good opportunities. Amorim chose not to start with a recognised striker, with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkee both starting on the bench, but United began brightly. Mainoo, playing as a ""false nine"", linked up with Alejandro Garnacho to create two big openings early on. United did step up their pressure after the break, with Fernandes finding more influence from his deeper midfield role, but they looked out of ideas on how to cut open their opponents, and their desperation for an equaliser ultimately cost them. Amorim is still yet to win back-to-back Premier League matches since his appointment and has only two wins from seven in the competition at Old Trafford in that time, leaving him to go back to the drawing board before their trip to Tottenham Hotspur in two weeks time. Eagles soar at Old Trafford
Oliver Glasner’s side would have fancied their chances of bouncing back from their defeat to Brentford, having won three of their last five visits to Old Trafford. They quickly shook themselves off after a slow start and arguably should have been in the lead at half-time having nullified the United threat. He was unfortunate not to get an assist after Lacroix hit the bar, and ran the United defence ragged, showcasing how shaky the hosts were at the back. They did not panic despite Man Utd's late attempts to push them back, and thanks to Mateta’s goals, they are now unbeaten in six Premier League fixtures on the road, though it is back to Selhurst Park next to face a resurgent Everton.

Mateta looked to have found the breakthrough shortly before half-time, bursting through 1v1, but Onana tipped his dinked effort wide of the far post.

490,490,manchester-city,2024-12-26,"Erling Haaland had a penalty saved by Jordan Pickford to ensure Manchester City’s struggles continued as they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Everton on Boxing Day. Bernardo Silva, sporting the City armband, fired Pep Guardiola’s side into a 14th-minute lead when his sliding shot deflected in off the boot of Jarrad Branthwaite. But Everton dragged themselves level nine minutes before the interval through Iliman Ndiaye’s stunning finish, with the Senegal attacking midfielder expertly punishing some slack City defending. Man City had a great opportunity to retake the lead, but Pickford's brilliant penalty save in the second half earned the visitors a point. In making the save, Pickford became the first goalkeeper to prevent Haaland from scoring a penalty in the Premier League. The draw means City edge up to sixth in the standings, but they may not end Thursday in that position with seven further fixtures still to be played, including Newcastle and Aston Villa - the two teams directly below them - doing battle. City’s dominance was rewarded soon after when Silva was slipped in by Jeremy Doku, with the Portugal international’s sliding shot deflecting off the boot of Branthwaite and squirming past Pickford. The hosts had the opportunity to retake the lead eight minutes after the restart when Savinho was felled by Vitalii Mykolenko in the box, but Haaland saw his spot-kick saved by Pickford, and despite nodding in after Gvardiol’s header from the rebound, the striker was offside. Despite a sustained spell of City pressure, Everton almost produced a sucker punch in the closing stages. Stuttering City get stuck against Toffees
City were still licking their wounds from a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa last time out, but history favoured a return to winning ways as they had gone 13 Premier League matches unbeaten against Everton at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League coming into this contest. Guardiola, however, would have to do without some of his key players, naming a league matchday squad that did not feature at least one of Kyle Walker, John Stones, Ederson or Jack Grealish since 13 May 2017, a 2-1 win over Leicester City. City started quickly after the break in their search for the lead, with Haaland’s back-post header picking out Savinho to force a good save from Pickford, before the visiting goalkeeper showcased his shot-stopping ability from 12 yards against City's out-of-sorts No 9. The hosts will have been aware of Everton’s defensive stubbornness and they looked increasingly unable to breach the Toffees’ stern defensive rearguard as the match progressed, despite throwing on Kevin De Bruyne. Another impressive draw for Everton
Having produced back-to-back 0-0 draws against two title hopefuls in Arsenal and Chelsea, Everton once again showcased their resilience against one of the top sides in the Premier League, albeit against an out-of-form City side. After withstanding an early wave of City pressure, Mangala fired Everton’s first warning shot but was unable to test Ortega, though the German goalkeeper was called into action shortly after to pluck Idrissa Gueye’s rasping drive out of the sky. Even though City had more of the ball and chances, the Toffees always displayed confidence when they ventured into the forward areas, with Ndiaye’s stunning finish a moment to remember for the travelling fans. Branthwaite was on hand to ensure Everton kept the match level when Seamus Coleman gave the ball away to Phil Foden in a dangerous area, but for all their defensive brilliance, Mykolenko’s mistimed challenge on Savinho threatened to undo Everton’s good work.

491,491,everton,2024-12-26,"Erling Haaland had a penalty saved by Jordan Pickford to ensure Manchester City’s struggles continued as they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Everton on Boxing Day. Bernardo Silva, sporting the City armband, fired Pep Guardiola’s side into a 14th-minute lead when his sliding shot deflected in off the boot of Jarrad Branthwaite. But Everton dragged themselves level nine minutes before the interval through Iliman Ndiaye’s stunning finish, with the Senegal attacking midfielder expertly punishing some slack City defending. Man City had a great opportunity to retake the lead, but Pickford's brilliant penalty save in the second half earned the visitors a point. In making the save, Pickford became the first goalkeeper to prevent Haaland from scoring a penalty in the Premier League. Everton, meanwhile, are up to 15th, increasing the gap between themselves and the bottom three to five points. How the match unfolded
Josko Gvardiol struck the post inside the opening three minutes from a short corner routine before dazzling footwork from Savinho forced Pickford into a smart low stop. City’s dominance was rewarded soon after when Silva was slipped in by Jeremy Doku, with the Portugal international’s sliding shot deflecting off the boot of Branthwaite and squirming past Pickford. The hosts had the opportunity to retake the lead eight minutes after the restart when Savinho was felled by Vitalii Mykolenko in the box, but Haaland saw his spot-kick saved by Pickford, and despite nodding in after Gvardiol’s header from the rebound, the striker was offside. Despite a sustained spell of City pressure, Everton almost produced a sucker punch in the closing stages. Stuttering City get stuck against Toffees
City were still licking their wounds from a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa last time out, but history favoured a return to winning ways as they had gone 13 Premier League matches unbeaten against Everton at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League coming into this contest. City started quickly after the break in their search for the lead, with Haaland’s back-post header picking out Savinho to force a good save from Pickford, before the visiting goalkeeper showcased his shot-stopping ability from 12 yards against City's out-of-sorts No 9. The hosts will have been aware of Everton’s defensive stubbornness and they looked increasingly unable to breach the Toffees’ stern defensive rearguard as the match progressed, despite throwing on Kevin De Bruyne. They almost found themselves staring another defeat in the face, with Everton squandering several chances late on, and huge pressure remains on the champions before they visit Leicester next. Another impressive draw for Everton
Having produced back-to-back 0-0 draws against two title hopefuls in Arsenal and Chelsea, Everton once again showcased their resilience against one of the top sides in the Premier League, albeit against an out-of-form City side. After withstanding an early wave of City pressure, Mangala fired Everton’s first warning shot but was unable to test Ortega, though the German goalkeeper was called into action shortly after to pluck Idrissa Gueye’s rasping drive out of the sky. Even though City had more of the ball and chances, the Toffees always displayed confidence when they ventured into the forward areas, with Ndiaye’s stunning finish a moment to remember for the travelling fans. Branthwaite was on hand to ensure Everton kept the match level when Seamus Coleman gave the ball away to Phil Foden in a dangerous area, but for all their defensive brilliance, Mykolenko’s mistimed challenge on Savinho threatened to undo Everton’s good work. However, Pickford came to their rescue, and Everton never looked likely to be breached from then on. Sean Dyche may rue his side’s missed opportunities late on, most notably a four on two situation with Armando Broja leading the charge, but they were unable to make it count. However, he will be encouraged by three impressive results before Everton face Nottingham Forest and AFC Bournemouth in two key matches before the FA Cup third round. Club reports

492,492,arsenal,2025-02-02,"Arsenal moved back to within six points of the Premier League summit with a 5-1 rout of Manchester City, helped by Myles Lewis-Skelly's first senior goal. At 18 years and 129 days old, it meant he became the youngest player to score in the Premier League against the reigning champions since Wayne Rooney, who was 17y 150d, for Everton against Arsenal in March 2003, only for Ethan Nwaneri to manage the same feat later in the match, scoring Arsenal's fifth goal aged 17y 318d. Arsenal first went ahead with just 103 seconds played, Martin Odegaard sweeping into an open net after a mix-up involving John Stones and Manuel Akanji. Erling Haaland equalised early in the second half with a fine header, but Arsenal retook the lead one minute later through Thomas Partey's deflected strike. Lewis-Skelly's brilliant effort gave them breathing space and Kai Havertz added a breakaway fourth before, deep in stoppage time, Nwaneri curled in spectacularly to complete the scoring. Arsenal are now nine points clear of fourth-placed City, who could be overtaken by Chelsea should they beat West Ham United on Monday. How the match unfoled
Less than two minutes in, Akanji was put in trouble by Stones' pass and lost possession on the edge of Man City's area, allowing Havertz to square for a simple Odegaard finish. Gabriel Martinelli's dink was disallowed for offside four minutes later, while at the other end, David Raya made two excellent saves – one from a Josko Gvardiol header and another to deny Savinho – though Havertz squandered a great chance for Arsenal when he fired wide with only Stefan Ortega to beat. Arsenal pulled clear when Ortega failed to keep out Lewis-Skelly's effort at the end of a mazy run five minutes later, but the hosts were not done there. Havertz finished a lightning break to make it 4-1, before substitute Nwaneri completed the rout with a pinpoint strike. Arsenal get their revenge
There is no love lost between Arsenal and Man City, who have forged one of the great modern-day Premier League rivalries over the last two seasons, with Pep Guardiola's men edging the Gunners in two close-run title races. After Stones scored a 98th-minute equaliser to break Arsenal hearts, Haaland threw the ball against Gabriel Magalhaes' head, sparking a tussle involving several players. Haaland also clashed with several members of the Gunners' camp after full-time and it seems Gabriel had not forgotten those scenes. But Arsenal streaked away from there, allowing Gabriel to have the last laugh. Buoyed by this memorable win, Arsenal will now bid to overturn a two-goal deficit against Newcastle United in the EFL Cup semi-finals on Wednesday. Stones' pass to Akanji across the edge of the box was ill-advised, and the Switzerland international – taking his very first touch of the match – was blindsided by Leandro Trossard, who combined with Declan Rice to turn possession over. And while there was a huge hint of fortune about Arsenal's second goal, it came from another loose Man City pass in a dangerous position, this time from Phil Foden. Club reports

Arsenal get their revenge
There is no love lost between Arsenal and Man City, who have forged one of the great modern-day Premier League rivalries over the last two seasons, with Pep Guardiola's men edging the Gunners in two close-run title races. Their matches tend to be fractious, and September's 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium was no exception. After Stones scored a 98th-minute equaliser to break Arsenal hearts, Haaland threw the ball against Gabriel Magalhaes' head, sparking a tussle involving several players. Haaland also clashed with several members of the Gunners' camp after full-time and it seems Gabriel had not forgotten those scenes. When Odegaard made it 1-0, Gabriel reacted by celebrating in front of Haaland. To rub salt into Haaland’s wounds, Lewis-Skelly celebrated by mimicking his iconic meditation celebration. They will have one eye on Liverpool's match in hand at Everton on 12 February, before returning to league action at Leicester City three days later. City errors punished again
Last time out in the Premier League, Man City were forced to come from behind to beat Chelsea after a mistake from debutant Abdukodir Khusanov gifted the Blues an early opener. Khusanov dropped to the bench on Sunday, with Stones brought in for his first league start since before Christmas. If Guardiola thought the return of his most experienced centre-back would bring an error-free performance, he was mistaken. Stones' pass to Akanji across the edge of the box was ill-advised, and the Switzerland international – taking his very first touch of the match – was blindsided by Leandro Trossard, who combined with Declan Rice to turn possession over. And while there was a huge hint of fortune about Arsenal's second goal, it came from another loose Man City pass in a dangerous position, this time from Phil Foden. Man City have now committed eight errors leading to goals in the Premier League this season, their most in any campaign under Guardiola. Club reports

494,494,brighton-and-hove-albion,2024-12-27,"Brighton & Hove Albion were left frustrated by Brentford after failing to score from an incredible 24 shots as their winless run extended to six matches in a goalless draw at the Amex Stadium. Indeed, Brighton's Julio Enciso attempted eight shots alone in the first half - the most by a player in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League match since Luis Suarez in Liverpool's 2-1 win at Aston Villa in March 2013 (also eight). Neither team's attackers were at their best in a low-key second half in which Brentford dug deep to repel long spells of Brighton pressure. While Thomas Frank's side earned only their second away point of the season - and their first since November - Brighton have now not won in the Premier League since 23 November. The draw keeps Brighton 10th in the table, while Brentford climb above Tottenham Hotspur to go 11th, just two points behind the Seagulls. How the match unfolded
Both sides flew out of the blocks at the Amex in an entertaining first half, with Brentford going closest when Wissa was denied by a VAR check for offside. That opening came on the back of Brighton missing two big chances inside the first 10 minutes, with Enciso striking the post and Mark Flekken smartly thwarting Carlos Baleba. He preserved a point for Brentford by denying Brighton substitute Simon Adingra, with midfielder Yasin Ayari only able to lash the rebound off target. Out-of-sorts Brighton fire a blank
Brighton failed to mark their final home outing of the calendar year with a victory after being frustrated by Brentford's dogged defending, and - perhaps worryingly for Fabian Hurzeler - that is becoming something of a theme. This draw means they end 2024 with just 13 goals scored in their last nine league games at the Amex Stadium. After enjoying a strong start to 2024/25, Brighton have hit something of a wall of late, only scoring twice while taking two points from their last three home matches. Players such as Kaoru Mitoma, Joao Pedro, Enciso, Georginio Rutter and Adingra were all frustrated by Brentford, who become only the second visiting team to keep a clean sheet at the Amex this season, after Ipswich Town. Brighton's sudden loss of cutting edge is something that must be addressed if they are to push for Europe in the new year. The Seagulls did receive one major boost, however, when Solly March returned to action following an injury lay-off lasting over a year. However, they headed to Brighton with the lowest number of away points, with just one point secured on their travels, via a 0-0 draw at Everton in November. Frank has admitted to being concerned about their lack of durability on the road, but they stood up to the challenge posed by Brighton and can now match Southampton's total of two away points collected this season. Brentford relied on their defenders in the closing stages, with Ben Mee and Nathan Collins marshalling the backline against a Seagulls attack which peppered their goal with 24 shots, though only seven hit the target.

It was Brentford, however, who went closest to a winner as Yoane Wissa had a 14th-minute strike disallowed for offside following a VAR review, amid a flurry of first-half chances at both ends.

That opening came on the back of Brighton missing two big chances inside the first 10 minutes, with Enciso striking the post and Mark Flekken smartly thwarting Carlos Baleba. Flekken then made another flying stop to keep out Matt O'Riley after 25 minutes, but the Dutch goalkeeper was forced off injured shortly before the break.

Brentford's Premier League away form has been in sharp contrast to their home returns this season.

496,496,nottingham-forest,2025-02-01,"Chris Wood scored a hat-trick as Nottingham Forest returned to winning ways with a magnificent 7-0 rout of Brighton & Hove Albion at the City Ground. Nuno Espirito Santo's team showed no signs of being rocked by their 5-0 defeat at AFC Bournemouth last weekend, going two better against Fabian Hurzeler's error-prone side. A Lewis Dunk own goal set Forest on their way, then Anthony Elanga helped himself to three assists as Brighton's backline was overwhelmed, teeing up Morgan Gibbs-White for one goal and two for Wood. Forest's biggest ever Premier League victory takes them level on 47 points with second-placed Arsenal, who face Manchester City on Sunday. How the match unfolded
Forest went ahead from their first attack 12 minutes in. Gibbs-White crossed from the right, and Dunk’s outstretched boot diverted the ball into his own net. Their second goal arrived after 25 minutes as Gibbs-White nodded Elanga's corner home at the near post. Williams then struck the base of a post from 20 yards out, and the rampant hosts had a third when Wood nodded an Elanga cross home, with the goal given on-pitch and confirmed by VAR following a check for offside. How close Welbeck was to scoring
Brighton pushed in the early stages of the second half, but Wood killed any slim hopes of a fightback with a 64th-minute tap-in, and he then kept his cool from 12 yards to make it 5-0 after Tariq Lamptey fouled Gibbs-White. Forest were not done there, though, as Williams blasted in a sixth from close range before Silva drilled home a seventh, having intercepted a dismal pass from Bart Verbruggen. Magnificent seven for Forest
With Forest suffering a chastening defeat against fellow surprise package Bournemouth last time out, some were left wondering if their momentum might have been stunted. Nuno demanded a reaction at home to another side harbouring European aspirations, and his team certainly did not let him down, with Gibbs-White, Elanga and Wood taking centre-stage. Forest's last meeting with Brighton, a 2-2 draw at the Amex Stadium last September, was not one to remember for Gibbs-White, who was sent off for a scything challenge on Joao Pedro. But he was everywhere in the first half of Saturday's game, forcing Dunk's own goal with a threatening cross into the six-yard box then showing great desire to power Elanga's corner home. Elanga has also enjoyed an excellent season, and three pinpoint crosses earned the former Manchester United winger three assists, taking him to eight for the season. He now has 17 Premier League goals this season, with only Stan Collymore in 1994/95 (22) netting more for Forest in a single campaign. Even after Nuno took the opportunity to give Wood and Gibbs-White a rest, Forest continued to hunt further goals and saw Williams and Silva chip in late on. It all amounted to a superb response from Forest, who have won eight of their last 10 league games. Brighton did carve out chances at the City Ground, and it could be argued that a 3-0 half-time lead flattered Forest somewhat. Perhaps most costly was a squandered opportunity from Yankuba Minteh, who broke through on goal but shot straight at Sels just two minutes after Forest's second of the game. Forest's seventh goal summed up their display, as Verbruggen passed straight to a grateful Silva on the edge of the box and was given no chance by the substitute's finish. Club reports

Back-to-back victories over Ipswich Town and Manchester United had reignited Brighton's hunt for European qualification, after they went eight games without a win in the Premier League between late November and early January. Brighton did carve out chances at the City Ground, and it could be argued that a 3-0 half-time lead flattered Forest somewhat. At 3-0, Welbeck was mere inches away from getting Brighton back in the game. Ultimately, however, the Seagulls were undone by an inability to keep things tight at the other end. Brighton's 38 goals conceded this season are the most of any team in the top half of the table, and with Chelsea up next on February 14, they simply must improve at the back. Club reports

498,498,nottingham-forest,2024-11-10,"Newcastle United fought back to win at the City Ground again on Sunday, beating high-flying Nottingham Forest 3-1 with a ruthless second-half display. The Magpies had defeated Forest away from home in each of the previous two seasons, but Nuno Espirito Santo's hosts looked set for a fourth win in a row when Murillo nodded in his first career goal. Isak, who netted twice in a 2-1 win at Forest in March 2023, then turned provider for the second goal as Joelinton brilliantly beat Matz Sels, before substitute Harvey Barnes broke away to net the third. Another victory, following on from last week's win against Arsenal, lifts Newcastle to within a point of Forest, who drop to fifth following Chelsea's 1-1 draw with the Gunners. How the match unfolded
Newcastle might have scored first when Anthony Gordon blazed over, but Forest led against the run of play after 21 minutes as Murillo was left completely unmarked from a free-kick to nod past Nick Pope. One of those situations almost saw Nicolas Dominguez double Forest's lead early in the second half, yet instead Newcastle were level as a scramble from a corner fell for Isak to sweep in. That allowed Newcastle to give Forest a taste of their own medicine, playing on the break, and although Isak volleyed agonisingly wide, the goalscorer then teed up Joelinton, who curled an outstanding effort home via the left-hand post. Backs to the wall for Forest
Forest had won three in a row against sides in the bottom half, but this was a sobering indication of what might be to come at the start of a tough run of fixtures. Forest perhaps would have hoped to recreate their 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield when they took the lead through Murillo, the centre-back recently called up to the Brazil squad for the first time, working hard to protect that advantage in the first half. Arsenal are up next for Forest after the international break, by which time Nuno will hope his defenders are refreshed and ready for a potentially brutal stretch. It was no surprise then that the Newcastle boss named an unchanged XI at the City Ground, and the outcome was much the same. Newcastle are short of natural right wingers, but both Gordon and Joelinton fulfilled that role against Forest, with the latter netting a vital goal. Club reports

499,499,newcastle-united,2024-11-10,"Newcastle United fought back to win at the City Ground again on Sunday, beating high-flying Nottingham Forest 3-1 with a ruthless second-half display. The Magpies had defeated Forest away from home in each of the previous two seasons, but Nuno Espirito Santo's hosts looked set for a fourth win in a row when Murillo nodded in his first career goal. That opener was arguably harsh on Newcastle, though, and a deserved equaliser arrived nine minutes after half-time as Alexander Isak scored in a fourth consecutive match in all competitions. Isak, who netted twice in a 2-1 win at Forest in March 2023, then turned provider for the second goal as Joelinton brilliantly beat Matz Sels, before substitute Harvey Barnes broke away to net the third. Another victory, following on from last week's win against Arsenal, lifts Newcastle to within a point of Forest, who drop to fifth following Chelsea's 1-1 draw with the Gunners. How the match unfolded
Newcastle might have scored first when Anthony Gordon blazed over, but Forest led against the run of play after 21 minutes as Murillo was left completely unmarked from a free-kick to nod past Nick Pope. The first half continued in the same vein, with Newcastle well on top and testing Sels through Bruno Guimaraes and Dan Burn but looking vulnerable to the counter. One of those situations almost saw Nicolas Dominguez double Forest's lead early in the second half, yet instead Newcastle were level as a scramble from a corner fell for Isak to sweep in. That allowed Newcastle to give Forest a taste of their own medicine, playing on the break, and although Isak volleyed agonisingly wide, the goalscorer then teed up Joelinton, who curled an outstanding effort home via the left-hand post. Another clinical counter made sure of the points seven minutes from time, with Barnes, on for the injured Gordon, cutting inside from the left and firing beyond Sels. But teams with the quality of Newcastle can afford to stay patient in the face of such frustration, and they were good value for the leveller, after which the league's second-best defence suddenly looked a little vulnerable. Howe finds winning formula
Newcastle lacked balance during a five-match winless run in the Premier League across September and October, largely performing well but wasting chances at one end while leaving themselves open at the other. Eddie Howe responded by reverting to a set-up widely used in the 2022-23 season, moving Joelinton into the forward line and bolstering the midfield, and he was rewarded with victories over Chelsea in the Carabao Cup and Arsenal in the league. It was no surprise then that the Newcastle boss named an unchanged XI at the City Ground, and the outcome was much the same. Most encouraging for Howe would have been the contributions from out wide. Newcastle are short of natural right wingers, but both Gordon and Joelinton fulfilled that role against Forest, with the latter netting a vital goal. The introduction of Barnes from the bench showed the depth of options on the left, and he scored one and might have had another in the closing seconds as Newcastle were ultimately comfortable against previously inspired opposition.

500,500,arsenal,2024-12-27,"Kai Havertz scored the only goal as Arsenal climbed to second place in the Premier League table with a narrow 1-0 victory over Ipswich Town. The German's seventh strike of the season proved enough for the hosts - who were playing their first match since star winger Bukayo Saka was ruled out for ""many weeks"" - while condemning their opponents to a fifth defeat in six matches. Arsenal broke the deadlock midway through the first half, with Havertz in the right place to turn in Leandro Trossard's inviting cross. Gabriel Magalhaes missed a golden opportunity to double the Gunners' lead when he headed wide from a corner just after the hour-mark, but his side were relatively untroubled in seeing out their slender triumph. Mikel Arteta's side leapfrog Chelsea and Nottingham Forest to go second and are six points behind leaders Liverpool, having played one more match than Arne Slot's men. How the match unfolded
Arsenal survived a scare inside the opening 25 seconds, when Leif Davis's deflected cross reached an unmarked Liam Delap at the near post, but the Ipswich forward could not make the vital connection with his outstretched leg. That let-off proved crucial as the Gunners broke through in the 23rd minute. Trossard kept Gabriel Martinelli's deep cross alive and whipped the ball into the six-yard box, where Havertz applied the finishing touch. Gabriel Jesus thought he had doubled Arsenal's lead 11 minutes later when he squeezed the ball home from a tight angle, only to be denied by the offside flag. The hosts squandered a fine chance to go 2-0 up in the 63rd minute, when an unmarked Gabriel somehow headed Declan Rice's deep corner wide from three yards out. Martin Odegaard and Mikel Merino also went close for Arsenal but, with their opponents unable to generate a genuine attacking threat at the other end, Havertz's solitary goal was enough to get them over the line and into second place. Raya sets club record with latest clean sheet
Following Chelsea's stunning capitulation in a 2-1 loss to Fulham on Boxing Day, Arsenal knew this was an opportunity to pounce and replace the Blues in the position just behind Liverpool. The Gunners had every right to feel confident they could get the job done at Emirates Stadium, where they were unbeaten in 11 Premier League matches, while keeping a clean sheet in each of their last three. After Delap's early opportunity for the visitors, Arsenal were very much in control for long periods of the contest, and it only seemed a matter of time before they edged their noses ahead. Ipswich's resolve was broken after 23 minutes with Trossard's cross begging to be attacked, and Havertz unable to miss from right under the crossbar. David Raya claimed his 23rd clean sheet in 50 Premier League appearances for Arsenal, breaking David Seaman's club record for the most shutouts registered after half a century of games in the division. Arsenal may still be some way away from their free-flowing best in attack, but their fearsome defensive record gives them every chance of being there or thereabouts in the Premier League title race. But ultimately, that was as close as the visitors came to troubling Raya in the Arsenal goal. With eight of Ipswich's 12 points this season coming on the road, McKenna will have sensed an opportunity for his side to potentially get themselves back into the match, particularly with Arsenal deprived of injured attackers Saka and Raheem Sterling.

502,502,manchester-united,2024-11-10,"Bruno Fernandes proved the difference as Manchester United returned to winning ways in the Premier League with a 3-0 victory over Leicester City. The United captain, making his 250th appearance for the club, had a hand in all three goals, ensuring Ruud van Nistelrooy signed off as interim head coach with a win. Fernandes opened the scoring 17 minutes in before his presence forced Victor Kristiansen to turn it into the back of his own net 21 minutes later. Substitute Alejandro Garnacho rounded off the scoring late on with a stunning strike to wrap up a comfortable win at Old Trafford in Man Utd's final match before new head coach Ruben Amorim takes charge. United move on to 15 points but remain 13th in the table, while Leicester stay two places behind them on 10 points. How the match unfolded
The hosts got off to a quick start, with Amad Diallo playing a perfectly-weighted backheel into Fernandes, who curled in a low finish from the edge of the box. Wilfred Ndidi could have equalised before the half-hour mark, but goalkeeper Andre Onana made himself big to smother the Leicester player in a 1v1. Jordan Ayew almost pulled a goal back in the 69th minute, spinning away from three United defenders to fizz a shot towards the near post, with Onana once again making a fine save. Garnacho sliced a shot over the crossbar after his introduction from the bench midway through the second half. Promising signs for Man Utd
Van Nistelrooy could not have asked for a better sign-off to his time in interim charge of Man Utd, during which he has overseen three wins and a draw across all competitions in his four matches at the helm. A return to form for Fernandes has also proved timely, with the Portuguese causing all sorts of problems for Kristiansen in an energetic first half and finishing with a goal and an assist. Even when their clinical edge looked like it was fading in the second half, Garnacho’s introduction added a spark to United’s forward play. With Amorim set to be in charge for United’s match at Ipswich Town - their next after the international break - the signs from Sunday showed that the incoming head coach will have plenty to work with. Ayew has provided two of those, snatching a last-gasp win at Southampton before ensuring Leicester left Ipswich with a point last weekend, but he struggled to have an impact after being given a chance from the start at Old Trafford. They were not helped by the absence of Jamie Vardy, who would have relished a chance to play off the back of a United defence that had looked disconnected in previous weeks. Steve Cooper would not have lost hope given their recent run though, and Leicester did improve in the second half, taking the game to a tiring United side. Club reports

He made no mistake with his second chance, brilliantly bending his shot out of Hermansen’s reach into the top corner. No late show for Leicester
Leicester have left it late in their recent away matches, with stoppage-time goals bringing the drama on so many occasions this season. Ayew has provided two of those, snatching a last-gasp win at Southampton before ensuring Leicester left Ipswich with a point last weekend, but he struggled to have an impact after being given a chance from the start at Old Trafford. They were not helped by the absence of Jamie Vardy, who would have relished a chance to play off the back of a United defence that had looked disconnected in previous weeks.

West Ham sit 13th, while Liverpool’s title rivals must now hope for the Reds to slip up after the turn of the year. The Reds were on the front foot from the off, as Salah forced an instinctive early stop from Alphonse Areola, before they deservedly went ahead on the half-hour as Diaz smashed in off the upright. Mohammed Kudus struck the woodwork at the other end, but it was 2-0 less than two minutes later as Salah brilliantly span clear of his marker to tee up Gakpo. West Ham simply had no response, and Alexander-Arnold's 54th-minute rocket deceived Areola after taking a wicked deflection off Konstantinos Mavropanos. An injury to talisman Jarrod Bowen compounded Julen Lopetegui’s frustration, before Liverpool’s strength in depth told as substitute Jota lashed in goal number five from another Salah assist, though West Ham did go close to a consolation when Luis Guilherme hit the post in stoppage time. Despite the ruthless nature of this victory in the capital, Slot knows it could have been an even greater winning margin, as West Ham wilted under the pressure. The first half alone included eight shots on target for Liverpool, and only some fine stops from Areola stopped the Hammers from suffering complete humiliation. A resounding defeat, and more pressure on Lopetegui, meant there was little to celebrate for the Hammers fans heading out of London Stadium after their final game of 2024. As West Ham’s defenders struggled to cope with wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, their fans were at least offered hope on the counter by Kudus, who caused plenty of problems for the Reds’ backline. As it was, West Ham were further behind swiftly after. While Kudus provided a bright spark and a loss to the league leaders is not necessarily a disaster, but the manner of the defeat – on the back of four games unbeaten – will be frustrating for Lopetegui, whose team appeared to have turned a corner, but must now rally themselves for a trip to Manchester City.

Slot's team head back to Merseyside with their Premier League lead extended and their confidence given another boost. Arsenal and Chelsea will play in the coming days, while Nottingham Forest are flying high in second, but the Reds look by far the team’s superior side heading into 2025. As the goals flowed, Liverpool's attackers showed no signs of slowing down, with an even spread across their starting front line, as Salah, Gakpo and Diaz all found the back of the net.

The first half alone included eight shots on target for Liverpool, and only some fine stops from Areola stopped the Hammers from suffering complete humiliation. Salah, meanwhile, has now set a Premier League record – he has provided at least one goal and one assist in eight different games this season. Whether he meant to spin the ball into Gakpo’s path for Liverpool’s second goal, only he knows, but Salah’s form is the driving force to Slot’s winning machine. The fixture schedule affords Liverpool a small break before their next outing – ahead of hosting rivals Manchester United on January 5 – and Slot will hope that rest sets the stage for his team to cruise away in 2025. As West Ham’s defenders struggled to cope with wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, their fans were at least offered hope on the counter by Kudus, who caused plenty of problems for the Reds’ backline. He created an early chance that was squandered by Lucas Paqueta, and if his effort against the post had gone in, Liverpool's storm may have been stalled. Club reports

506,506,bournemouth,2025-02-01,"Liverpool moved nine points clear at the top of the Premier League as Mohamed Salah scored both goals in their hard-fought 2-0 victory at AFC Bournemouth. Salah converted a penalty after Lewis Cook tripped Cody Gakpo in the first half, then bent a wonderful finish into the far corner to make the points safe with 15 minutes to play. Bournemouth entered Saturday's match unbeaten in 11 Premier League outings while Liverpool had gone 18 without losing, and the Cherries made the leaders work for their win. Liverpool added to their advantage over Arsenal – who face Manchester City on Sunday – and Nottingham Forest, while Bournemouth stay seventh on 40 points. How the match unfolded
Antoine Semenyo tested Alisson inside 12 seconds as Bournemouth started brightly, with the winger also rattling the near post with a ferocious left-footed effort in the 20th minute. Liverpool went ahead in the 30th minute as Gakpo went down in the area after being tripped by Cook, with the penalty confirmed following a VAR review that checked both the foul and a possible offside. Bournemouth continued to press, though, and Brooks drilled in an equaliser only to be denied by an offside call against Milos Kerkez, which was confirmed following a VAR review. The hosts did not let up in the second half, with Alisson making a close-range stop from Semenyo before Bournemouth missed their best chance to level in the 70th minute. Substitute Marcus Tavernier struck the post from distance, and in-form forward Kluivert somehow skewed wide of an open goal on the rebound. Cherries fall just short
Bournemouth's second season under Andoni Iraola has featured many high points, but perhaps last week's 5-0 thrashing of high-flying Nottingham Forest – a result accomplished without injured strikers Evanilson and Enes Unal – was the pick of the bunch. Over the previous 11 Premier League matchdays, no team had won more points than Bournemouth's 25, and both Man City and Arsenal had already been beaten at the Vitality Stadium this season. Then, within five minutes of Kluivert producing one of the misses of the season in the second half, Salah's unerring finish put the contest beyond Bournemouth. There were plenty of positives for Iraola to take, though. Should the Cherries perform similarly in their upcoming games against Southampton and Wolverhampton Wanderers, they will be confident of regaining their momentum. Resting those key players proved a wise decision as Liverpool were forced to contend with Bournemouth's all-action, vertical approach. They were a tad fortunate to see Bournemouth pass up several golden opportunities, with the woodwork also coming to the Reds' aid on two occasions. Club reports

Then, within five minutes of Kluivert producing one of the misses of the season in the second half, Salah's unerring finish put the contest beyond Bournemouth. Rested Reds led by Salah
With Liverpool having sealed qualification for the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League with a game to spare, Arne Slot used Wednesday's trip to PSV as an opportunity to shuffle his pack, leaving Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and several other big names at home. Resting those key players proved a wise decision as Liverpool were forced to contend with Bournemouth's all-action, vertical approach. They were a tad fortunate to see Bournemouth pass up several golden opportunities, with the woodwork also coming to the Reds' aid on two occasions. But winning without playing well is often said to be a mark of champions, and with Salah in fine form, Liverpool always have a chance. Salah's double took him to 25 goals for the season in all competitions, with 21 of those coming in the Premier League. Liverpool continue to grind out results courtesy of their Egyptian superstar, and with the rescheduled Merseyside derby to come in 11 days' time, they will sense a chance to pull clear in the title race.

City dominated possession but struggled to find a killer pass, and their hopes of a second-half fightback were dashed when Pedro Porro – who spent three years as a City player between 2019 and 2022 – capped another lightning break. Erling Haaland clipped the crossbar but that was as close as City came to making it competitive, with Brennan Johnson completing the rout as the worst run of Pep Guardiola's managerial career continued.

How the match unfolded
Guglielmo Vicario denied Haaland early on before Maddison stunned the Etihad Stadium in the 13th minute, arriving unmarked at the far post to prod Dejan Kulusevski's cross home. Haaland then rattled the crossbar after latching upon an error in the Spurs backline, but City were sliced open again in stoppage time. Rodri-less City struggle once again
Ahead of kick-off, the Etihad Stadium paid tribute to stricken star Rodri with an elaborate ceremony to mark his Ballon d'Or win. Never has his influence over City's midfield been more obvious. With the Spaniard sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury, City have lost five successive matches across all competitions, with their title defence threatening to unravel before the festive season is in full swing. It is the longest losing run of Guardiola's managerial career, and not been the way he would have wanted to celebrate the contract extension he agreed earlier in the week. Rodri's ability to snuff out opposition attacks at source and maintain control of the midfield has been central to City's game since he arrived in Manchester five years ago. City's lack of a like-for-like Rodri replacement will be a point of concern for them ahead of a blockbuster clash with Liverpool at Anfield next. When allowed space to play on the counter-attack at the Etihad Stadium, they produced some of their most dazzling football under Postecoglou to date. Spurs have earned a reputation as a thorn in City's side in recent years, winning three of four matches against them across 2021/22 and 2022/23, then fighting back to secure a memorable 3-3 draw in this exact fixture last season. This was surely the most convincing they have ever looked against City, though. Club reports

509,509,tottenham-hotspur,2024-11-23,"Manchester City's losing streak stretched to five games as Tottenham Hotspur stunned the Premier League champions with a 4-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium. On his 28th birthday, James Maddison scored twice in the first 20 minutes as Ange Postecoglou's visitors caught out their hosts on the counter-attack. City dominated possession but struggled to find a killer pass, and their hopes of a second-half fightback were dashed when Pedro Porro – who spent three years as a City player between 2019 and 2022 – capped another lightning break. Erling Haaland clipped the crossbar but that was as close as City came to making it competitive, with Brennan Johnson completing the rout as the worst run of Pep Guardiola's managerial career continued. Second-placed City could now find themselves eight points adrift of the summit after Liverpool’s trip to Southampton on Sunday, while Spurs climbed to sixth, four points further back. How the match unfolded
Guglielmo Vicario denied Haaland early on before Maddison stunned the Etihad Stadium in the 13th minute, arriving unmarked at the far post to prod Dejan Kulusevski's cross home. The birthday boy had his second seven minutes later, intercepting Josko Gvardiol's wayward ball before exchanging passes with Son Heung-min and dinking his finish over Ederson. Ederson tipped Dominic Solanke's shot over at full stretch as the visitors threatened a third, while Vicario dashed from his line to smother Savinho's lob shortly before half-time. Seven minutes after the interval, the visitors had further daylight thanks to Porro, who lashed into the top-left corner after being teed up by Solanke on the break. Haaland then rattled the crossbar after latching upon an error in the Spurs backline, but City were sliced open again in stoppage time. Timo Werner drove beyond Kyle Walker before teeing up fellow substitute Brennan Johnson for an easy finish. With the Spaniard sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury, City have lost five successive matches across all competitions, with their title defence threatening to unravel before the festive season is in full swing. Without him, the champions struggled to deal with Spurs’ counter. Porro's goal in particular will have been tough to take. Kulusevski had plenty of space on the left-hand side as he latched onto Son's pass before sweeping the ball out to Solanke. Porro was then unmarked as he stepped onto the striker's cutback to fire home. Scintillating Spurs bounce back
Spurs’ performance here was night and day compared to that of their failed approach in their 2-1 defeat at home to Ipswich Town before the international break. When allowed space to play on the counter-attack at the Etihad Stadium, they produced some of their most dazzling football under Postecoglou to date. The individual skills of Spurs' attackers were on full display, from Kulusevski's wonderful delivery for Maddison's opener, to the blistering pace shown by Werner in the build-up to the fourth. Spurs have earned a reputation as a thorn in City's side in recent years, winning three of four matches against them across 2021/22 and 2022/23, then fighting back to secure a memorable 3-3 draw in this exact fixture last season.

510,510,leicester-city,2024-12-08,"Leicester City scored two late goals to come back from 2-0 down and draw 2-2 with Brighton & Hove Albion. Yet Leicester talisman Jamie Vardy dragged Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Foxes back into the contest as he poked in from close range to set up a grandstand finish. And Vardy was involved in the stoppage-time equaliser, teeing up Bobby De Cordova-Reid to tap in and claim a draw in dramatic fashion. The result leaves Leicester 16th in the table, five points above the relegation zone and unbeaten in two matches under new manager Van Nistelrooy. How the match unfolded
The visitors had the better of the opening exchanges, with Joao Pedro volleying wide after 14 minutes before Pervis Estupinan tested Mads Hermansen from distance on a couple of occasions, and Kaoru Mitoma squandered a golden chance by firing over from close range. Leicester were a little more lively in the second half, Vardy having a near-post shot blocked by Jan Paul van Hecke, before Joao Pedro saw a shot stopped by Jannik Vestergaard at the other end. It was Brighton who found the next moment of quality, though, when Minteh raced away down the left before cutting into the area, teasing the recovering Leicester defenders and drilling low into the left-hand corner. But Vardy’s crisp finish on 86 minutes set up a tense finish for Brighton, and Leicester secured a memorable point when Igor Julio was caught in possession, with De Cordova-Reid on hand for a simple finish from Vardy’s pass. Foxes find a way
For much of this contest, Leicester struggled to lay a glove on a Brighton side firmly in control. Leicester have rarely wowed with their performances but do keep going until the end, this the third occasion this season that they have netted a crucial added-time goal. Leicester conceded too many chances in their win against West Ham United on Tuesday and struggled to create enough themselves in this match but have come away with four points from the Dutchman’s first two matches in charge, which is testament to their character. The Seagulls have failed to win any game against teams sitting 14th or lower since their opening-day 3-0 victory over Everton, failing to beat Ipswich Town, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southampton and now Leicester in that time. Instead, they will reflect on two points dropped as they appeared to wilt in the face of the late Leicester onslaught. Club reports

512,512,everton,2025-02-01,"Everton scored the fourth-fastest goal in Premier League history as their revival under David Moyes continued with a resounding 4-0 defeat of Leicester City at Goodison Park. Abdoulaye Doucoure got them going after just 10 seconds, before Beto doubled Everton’s tally soon after. Iliman Ndiaye added further gloss late on as Everton surged above Tottenham Hotspur into 15th place, nine points clear of 17th-placed Leicester. This was the Toffees' third league win in a row - the first time they have achieved such a run this season. How the match unfolded
Everton made a dream start as Leicester failed to deal with Jordan Pickford’s long ball, allowing Doucoure to burst into the box and drill home. Beto, in for the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin, exposed the Foxes' high line to latch on to a weighted pass by James Tarkowski and arrow a first-time finish across Mads Hermansen into the bottom-left corner. With the hard work done, Everton kept Leicester at arm’s length after the restart, though Jesper Lindstrom should have done better when he struck at Hermansen from close range. Moyes working his magic
Everton were forced to dig deep to grind out three points against Brighton last week, but this was a far more assured performance, aided by two rapid goals. Doucoure and Beto’s goals inside the first six minutes marked the earliest the Toffees had scored two goals in a Premier League match. Unlike in their last home match, when they were made to hold on to claim a 3-2 win over Spurs, Everton never looked likely to slip up as they aimed to further ease any relegation concerns. Moyes was forced to reshuffle his pack, due to the injuries Calvert-Lewin and Orel Mangala sustained at Brighton, but he will be delighted with the performances from their replacements. Beto is, as it stands, Everton’s only fit striker, but he proved a handful through his endeavour and took both of his goals confidently. He hassled and pressed out of possession, but showed plenty of class on the ball, including a superb assist for Everton’s third goal. Next up is an FA Cup tie against Bournemouth, before Everton return to Premier League action against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby. They set the tone for Doucoure’s opener, with Boubakary Soumare failing to deal with Pickford’s punt, and the centre-backs behind him allowing Doucoure the freedom of the penalty area. Leicester's workmanlike midfield were distinctly second-best throughout and their struggles in progressing the ball up the pitch meant it took them until the 73rd minute to register their only shot on target, with Pickford saving easily from Patson Daka.

Doucoure sliced over and James Garner hit the post before the latter – making his first start since October – sent Beto through on goal with a sublime pass, and the striker duly tucked in his second, with Leicester’s defence once again caught cold. With the hard work done, Everton kept Leicester at arm’s length after the restart, though Jesper Lindstrom should have done better when he struck at Hermansen from close range. Ndiaye, though, made no such mistake in the 90th minute, finishing calmly after pouncing on a mix-up in the Leicester defence, capping off an ideal day for the hosts. Foxes have reason to fear
Ruud van Nistelrooy would have been looking for his team to pick up momentum after their impressive 2-1 comeback win over Tottenham last week, but those hopes were extinguished within the opening minutes, as Leicester found themselves on the backfoot from the get-go. Defensively, the Foxes were badly lacking. Bilal El Khannouss, so integral to the win at Spurs, was starved of opportunities, while Jamie Vardy had just nine touches before he was taken off on the hour.

Ipswich made the stronger start, but Southampton struck first after 21 minutes as Mateus Fernandes' deflected cross fell kindly for Aribo, with Arijanet Muric unable to keep his volley out of the net. Ipswich went close to turning the contest around before the break – Ramsdale denied Nathan Broadhead from close range, while Julio Enciso curled a free-kick just wide. Ipswich slump to another defeat
Having lost their last three Premier League matches, conceding 12 goals along the way, Ipswich will have welcomed the opportunity to get back on track against the division’s bottom side. With 17th-place Leicester City losing at Everton and 18th-place Wolverhampton Wanderers playing Aston Villa later on Saturday, this was a good chance for Kieran McKenna’s side to climb out of the bottom three.

The Saints striker netted the decisive goal three minutes from time in the battle of the division’s bottom two sides. It looked like the spoils would be shared after Liam Delap’s ninth league goal of the season cancelled out Joe Aribo’s earlier volley in the first half. However, there was to be a late twist, with Onuachu pouncing on the rebound of Kamaldeen Sulemana’s saved strike to snatch the visitors’ first away league win of the campaign. How the match unfolded
Ipswich made the stronger start, but Southampton struck first after 21 minutes as Mateus Fernandes' deflected cross fell kindly for Aribo, with Arijanet Muric unable to keep his volley out of the net. The forward darted in behind to beat Jan Bednarek to a loose ball, and calmly slotted past Aaron Ramsdale. With only three minutes of the 90 remaining, Muric could only parry Sulemana’s low drive, and Onuachu reacted quickest to pounce on the loose ball and snatch all three points for the visitors. The hosts made a positive start without creating any genuine opportunities to break the deadlock before Aribo struck the opener. Delap demonstrated brilliant composure to find the net just under 23 years after his father Rory did so for Southampton in the last Premier League meeting between the sides at Portman Road. They were punished late on with Muric unable to hold Sulemana’s shot, and Onuachu condemned them to a fourth straight defeat. Saints snatch crucial three points
Having collected the fewest points at this stage of a Premier League season – and on a run of six straight defeats – Southampton were desperate to stop the rot. Facing the prospect of losing seven straight league matches for the first time in their history, the Saints had to maintain their defensive discipline as Ipswich came out of the blocks quickly. They would not have been getting too far ahead of themselves when Aribo put them in front, having lost 20 points from winning positions this season.

516,516,tottenham-hotspur,2024-12-29,"Jorgen Strand Larsen's late leveller extended Vitor Pereira's unbeaten start at Wolverhampton Wanderers to three matches, while the 2-2 draw at Tottenham Hotspur further increased the pressure on the hosts' head coach Ange Postecoglou. Postecoglou may have been fearing the worst when Hwang Hee-chan's seventh-minute opener put Wolves ahead at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday, but Rodrigo Bentancur levelled five minutes later. Although Son Heung-min saw his 43rd-minute penalty saved by Jose Sa, Spurs took the lead anyway through Brennan Johnson – who won the spot-kick – in a chaotic ending to the first half. A third straight league outing without victory leaves Spurs 11th in the table, while 17th-placed Wolves are two points clear of the bottom three. Spurs levelled when Bentancur lost his marker and rose highest to thump a header from Pedro Porro's corner past Sa, who then proved a penalty hero for Pereira's side. Sa guessed the right way to keep out Son's spot-kick towards the top-left corner after Andre had clumsily felled the marauding Johnson. But Postecoglou's team would not be denied in the third minute of first-half stoppage time – Dejan Kulusevski powered into the area before offloading for Johnson to sweep home from close range. Kulusevski later saw an effort cleared off the line by Santiago Bueno, and that miss came back to haunt Spurs when Larsen found space from Ait-Nouri's incisive pass and hammered past Fraser Forster from a tight angle. Spurs’ unhappy Christmas
Speculation has grown over Postecoglou's future after Spurs were beaten by Liverpool and narrowly edged out by Nottingham Forest in the last week, and he did not get the morale-boosting victory he needed today. It came as no surprise when Hwang swept past Forster as Spurs conceded the opening goal at home for a 15th Premier League match in 2024 – the most by any side in a single calendar year in the competition's history. Their response was encouraging, however, as Porro's corner found Bentancur before Radu Dragusin headed just wide from the same set-piece routine soon after. After Johnson's goal, Spurs should have gone on to see out the match. However, another injury blow for Postecoglou came as Destiny Udogie limped off with a muscle issue early in the second half, and that misery was further compounded when Spurs' slack defending was punished by Strand Larsen. Pape Sarr could still have snatched a late winner, but he turned Kulusevski's cross wide, leaving Postecoglou – with just one win in seven league matches – desperately needing improvements when his side host Newcastle United next Saturday. Wolves escape but defensive improvements needed
Pereira has enjoyed a brilliant start to life at Wolves after back-to-back wins over Leicester City and Manchester United, and now this hard-fought point at Spurs. Cunha's long-range strike narrowly evaded the top-left corner with the scores level, though Wolves had no answer to a barrage of pressure that brought Son's penalty failure before Johnson's routine finish from close range.

However, Larsen – introduced at half-time in place of in-form Matheus Cunha, who seemed to have suffered a knee injury – latched onto Rayan Ait-Nouri's pass before firing into the roof of the net to snatch a point with just three minutes of normal time remaining. A third straight league outing without victory leaves Spurs 11th in the table, while 17th-placed Wolves are two points clear of the bottom three. How the match unfolded
A well-worked free-kick routine brought Wolves their opener, Hwang receiving a pass from Ait-Nouri before arrowing his finish into the bottom-right corner from the edge of the box. Wolves escape but defensive improvements needed
Pereira has enjoyed a brilliant start to life at Wolves after back-to-back wins over Leicester City and Manchester United, and now this hard-fought point at Spurs. Cunha scored in both of those wins, and played a part in Wolves' opener after winning the right-sided free-kick that Ait-Nouri rolled short for Hwang to score. The Brazilian forward fired just wide from long distance shortly after Wolves' set-piece issues had been exposed once more for Bentancur's equaliser, and those troubles were almost punished again when Dragusin nodded narrowly off target. Cunha's long-range strike narrowly evaded the top-left corner with the scores level, though Wolves had no answer to a barrage of pressure that brought Son's penalty failure before Johnson's routine finish from close range. Cunha's injury meant Larsen came on, and that change paid off when the towering striker scored late on, while Wolves could have stolen all three points if not for Forster keeping out Matt Doherty's late header. Strand Larsen's introduction serves a timely reminder of the attacking talent at Pereira's disposal but defensive issues – largely from set-pieces – need correcting ahead of Wolves hosting in-form Nottingham Forest at Molineux next Monday.

518,518,ipswich-town,2024-12-08,"An inspired display from substitute Dango Ouattara earned AFC Bournemouth a huge 2-1 victory over Ipswich Town, who remain without a win in the Premier League at Portman Road this season. The win moves Bournemouth up to eighth in the table, while Ipswich remain in 18th, four points adrift of Crystal Palace. Ipswich overcame their shaky beginning and took the lead through Chaplin, who curled home Burgess’ delivery. The Cherries improved after the break, with Cook’s effort from distance fizzing just past a post, but Ipswich were a threat on the counter-attack, with Szmodics forcing another save from Kepa after being slipped through by Liam Delap. The Tractor Boys looked on course for a first home win of the season until Ouattara beat the onrushing Muric to the ball and crossed for Unal to equalise, before the Burkina Faso forward struck the decisive blow deep into stoppage time. McKenna’s men dealt blow by late goals
Following the disappointment of losing at home to Crystal Palace in midweek, Kieran McKenna will be similarly displeased with a result which leaves them four points behind Palace in 17th position. After navigating a tricky opening, Ipswich were on top at various points of the first half, making their pressure count with a well-worked Chaplin goal and having other opportunities to double their lead. But the second half was a far different affair, with Bournemouth having much of the ball, leaving McKenna’s side needing to remain compact and well-organised out of possession while trying to hit them on the break, through the likes of Omari Hutchinson and the relentless Delap. Ipswich will seek to bounce back from this defeat when they travel to face fellow relegation strugglers Wolverhampton Wanderers next Saturday. After keeping Ipswich penned inside their own half for much of the second half, Bournemouth left it late to turn their sustained possession into meaningful chances, rewarded with two well-taken efforts that capped off fine build-up play.

But the Cherries sealed the win late on after David Brooks saw his effort saved by Arijanet Muric, only for the rebound to fall fortuitously for Ouattara to poke home. The win moves Bournemouth up to eighth in the table, while Ipswich remain in 18th, four points adrift of Crystal Palace. How the match unfolded
Bournemouth made an encouraging start and almost went ahead early on, but Marcus Tavernier was unable to convert Milos Kerkez’s fizzing cross from close range. Tavernier then struck a post at the other end before Sam Szmodics’ corner was turned into his own net by Lewis Cook, but the goal was disallowed after a foul on Kepa, with Michael Salisbury’s on-field decision confirmed by VAR. The Cherries improved after the break, with Cook’s effort from distance fizzing just past a post, but Ipswich were a threat on the counter-attack, with Szmodics forcing another save from Kepa after being slipped through by Liam Delap. But the second half was a far different affair, with Bournemouth having much of the ball, leaving McKenna’s side needing to remain compact and well-organised out of possession while trying to hit them on the break, through the likes of Omari Hutchinson and the relentless Delap. Unfortunately, they were unable to stand firm, despite Burgess showing his quality at both ends for his side, setting up Chaplin for the goal, followed by a wonderful last-ditch challenge to deny Justin Kluivert before superbly blocking Antoine Semenyo’s cross when Bournemouth had a three-on-two in the final 10 minutes. Super subs star for Cherries
Andoni Iraola’s side performed brilliantly to beat Tottenham Hotspur in midweek, backing up that triumph with their late win on Sunday, despite being behind for the majority of the match. Just like in midweek, Bournemouth were guilty of wasting numerous chances, mainly in the first half, through Semenyo and Tavernier. After keeping Ipswich penned inside their own half for much of the second half, Bournemouth left it late to turn their sustained possession into meaningful chances, rewarded with two well-taken efforts that capped off fine build-up play. The Cherries will hope for a fourth-straight league win when they host West Ham United a week on Monday. Club reports

520,520,newcastle-united,2025-02-01,"Fulham staged a brilliant second-half comeback to edge Newcastle United 2-1 in an entertaining Premier League clash at St. Rodrigo Muniz’s deft finish from an Andreas Pereira free-kick eight minutes from time handed the Cottagers their first away win against Newcastle since 2009. Raul Jimenez scored his ninth league goal of the season just after the hour as he cancelled out Jacob Murphy’s opener for Eddie Howe’s side in the first half. Sandro Tonali and Alexander Isak struck the woodwork in either side of the break, but the Magpies were consigned to their second straight home defeat. Newcastle remain fifth with 41 points - level with fourth-placed Manchester City who face Arsenal on Sunday - while Fulham move up to ninth with their win. How the match unfolded
Newcastle were made to wait until the 28th minute for their first shot on target as Fabian Schar was slipped in by Bruno Guimaraes only for Bernd Leno to save well before Tonali struck the woodwork with a fierce strike from 30 yards out. Only two minutes later, Anthony Gordon drove forward with the ball down the left-hand side and his cross deflected kindly off Calvin Bassey and into the path of Murphy who finished first time. Leno was called upon again soon after, denying Tino Livramento, who was played through on goal by Isak five minutes before the half-time interval. Jimenez, however, restored parity in the 61st minute after intercepting Tonali’s loose pass before the Mexican placed Antonee Robinson’s cross home via a deflection off goalscorer Murphy. Newcastle beaten at home again
It was all looking good for Newcastle at the halfway point of the contest as Murphy’s goal had them back in the Premier League top four. However, Eddie Howe’s side once again came up short at home, having also lost 4-1 to AFC Bournemouth a fortnight ago. Howe fielded the same side that beat Southampton 3-1 last week, but they failed to come up with a reply after they were hit early by Fulham in the second half through Jimenez. Substitute Joe Willock arrived in the box unmarked but failed to wrap his foot around a cross from Isak in the 68th minute, arguably the hosts’ best chance of finding a second goal. As Newcastle probed for an equaliser, they struck the crossbar for the second time in the game when Isak’s curled effort had Leno beaten, but they were made to rue those misses as the visitors completed their comeback late on. With crunch clashes against champions Man City, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool to come up next, Howe will have his work cut out to help his side regain their winning momentum. Fulham produce spirited fightback
Jimenez and Emile Smith Rowe had struck inside 22 minutes as Fulham defeated Newcastle 3-1 at Craven Cottage in September. But it was the Magpies who made the brighter of starts on Saturday and deservedly went ahead, only for Silva’s side to come out a completely different team after the restart. Jimenez got behind the Newcastle backline in the 31st minute only to fluff his lines, while Adama Traore, who replaced the injured Harry Wilson, couldn’t get enough purchase on a header from Alex Iwobi’s cross three minutes later. But they got Newcastle firmly on the defensive at the start of the second period with Dubravka having to push away a long-range effort from Smith Rowe in the 48th minute while Jimenez’s shot was deflected behind by Schar soon after. Jimenez continued to create problems for Howe’s side before he initiated the comeback, with substitutes Muniz and Pereira combining to give Fulham only their third Premier League double over Newcastle - after 2006-07 and 2008-09.

Saka thought he had broken Fulham’s resolve when he dived in to turn home Martinelli’s cross, but Arsenal’s celebrations were cut short. Stubborn Fulham thwart Gunners once more
Fulham were looking to beat Arsenal in successive league matches for the first time in their history. It came following a patient, brave build-up play, too, with Adama Traore the only Fulham player not to touch the ball before Jimenez drilled in his fifth league goal of the season. Marco Silva’s side generally maintained their discipline as Arsenal sought a response, though their defence was unlocked by the league’s set-piece specialists early in the second half. Even so, apart from the momentary lapse for Saka’s late header, Fulham remained stubborn to ensure they took a well-earned point from this London derby. Silva will now want to see the same resolve from his players when they visit Liverpool next Saturday as Fulham look to stay firmly in the race for a top-six spot. The Gunners quickly got on top and asked questions of the Fulham defence from set-pieces, an area Mikel Arteta has said he wants them to be “masters” in.

Saliba, also on target in the 2-0 win over Manchester United in midweek, was in the right place at the right time again to score for the second match running. Arsenal’s clinical edge from set-pieces was evident once more, as they scored from a corner for the 23rd time in the Premier League since the start of last season. The Gunners were thwarted late on, as a three-match winning streak in the league came to an end. Arteta’s former club Everton visit Emirates Stadium next week, and Arsenal will see that as a great opportunity to get back to winning ways. Club reports

524,524,wolverhampton,2025-02-01,"Wolverhampton Wanderers moved out of the Premier League relegation zone thanks to a battling 2-0 derby win over Aston Villa. Buoyed by defeats for Leicester City and Ipswich Town earlier on Saturday, Wolves took their chance to push out of the bottom three at Molineux. Jean-Ricner Bellegarde opened the scoring in the 12th minute, with Matheus Cunha making the points safe deep into second-half stoppage time. Wolves are now 17th, two points clear of danger, while Villa sit in eighth. How the match unfolded
The hosts’ front-foot approach paid off when a well-worked team move culminated in Pablo Sarabia feeding Bellegarde, who slammed the ball in at Emiliano Martinez’s near post. Cunha might have made it 2-0 in the 36th minute, but having shrugged aside Boubacar Kamara, he was unable to beat Martinez, with Goncalo Guedes hammering wide on the rebound. Having weathered a wave of pressure, albeit without their goalkeeper Jose Sa being overly troubled, Wolves scored the second goal their performance merited when Cunha pounced on Ezri Konsa’s error and drilled home emphatically in the 97th minute. Wolves get their bite back
Vitor Pereira had a fantastic start as Wolves boss, though his team came into this encounter on the back of four straight league defeats. Yet they showed their intent from the off, and the move that resulted in Bellegarde’s opener was not one that would necessarily be associated with a team scrapping for safety at the foot of the table, as Wolves worked it patiently from the left wing before Sarabia provided the incisive pass. Cunha and Guedes might feel they should have done better with their one-on-one opportunities, though Martinez did make himself big to keep Villa in contention. It looked as though Wolves would be punished for a defensive lapse – and those earlier misses – when Malen nudged home, but the offside flag and the subsequent VAR check ensured a reprieve. From there, Wolves defended stoutly, with Sa only called upon late in the match. And fittingly, star man Cunha – who had been mooted as a potential transfer target for Villa – capped off an excellent individual display with a thumping finish late on.

525,525,aston-villa,2025-02-01,"Wolverhampton Wanderers moved out of the Premier League relegation zone thanks to a battling 2-0 derby win over Aston Villa. Villa were unhappy that Donyell Malen had a would-be equaliser disallowed in the 54th minute, but the visitors, who were perhaps suffering a hangover from their UEFA Champions League exploits in midweek, were far from at their best. Wolves are now 17th, two points clear of danger, while Villa sit in eighth. How the match unfolded
The hosts’ front-foot approach paid off when a well-worked team move culminated in Pablo Sarabia feeding Bellegarde, who slammed the ball in at Emiliano Martinez’s near post. Cunha might have made it 2-0 in the 36th minute, but having shrugged aside Boubacar Kamara, he was unable to beat Martinez, with Goncalo Guedes hammering wide on the rebound. First, he fired wide after latching onto Bellegarde’s through-ball, before he was thwarted by a fine Martinez save. Malen was one of four substitutes introduced by Unai Emery for the second half, and it seemed he had tucked in an equaliser from a well-worked free-kick routine. Having weathered a wave of pressure, albeit without their goalkeeper Jose Sa being overly troubled, Wolves scored the second goal their performance merited when Cunha pounced on Ezri Konsa’s error and drilled home emphatically in the 97th minute. Cunha and Guedes might feel they should have done better with their one-on-one opportunities, though Martinez did make himself big to keep Villa in contention. And fittingly, star man Cunha – who had been mooted as a potential transfer target for Villa – capped off an excellent individual display with a thumping finish late on. Villa suddenly short up top
There has been plenty of transfer speculation surrounding Villa over the past week. That has left Emery shorn of a backup striker, though, and if media reports are to be believed, Villa are making a move for Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford on loan. And after Saturday, that is a move that could well be vital for Villa to complete, with talisman Ollie Watkins having sustained an injury during the first half. That meant Malen had to fill in up front as Villa looked to turn the tide after the break, and the visitors were largely toothless despite the Dutchman’s endeavour. Villa may well feel hard done by when it comes to Malen’s disallowed goal, but this was a poor display by their high standards – indeed, they only went close again when Malen forced Sa into action in the 90th minute. Konsa’s blunder at the back for Cunha’s victory-sealing strike summed up the visitors' below-par display. While time will tell if they get a deal for Rashford over the line, Villa's immediate concern could well be Watkins’ fitness ahead of an FA Cup clash with Tottenham Hotspur next week, before they take on Ipswich on 15 February.

After Evanilson cancelled out Raul Jimenez’s first-half header, Fulham were on course for all three points when Harry Wilson nodded them back in front 18 minutes from time. However, there was to be a late twist, with Ouattara neatly chipping Bernd Leno to save a point for the visitors. Andoni Iraola’s team remain sixth in the Premier League table and one point ahead of Marco Silva's men, who stay eighth. David Brooks' fierce volley was held by Leno, who also thwarted Antoine Semenyo. That let-off proved crucial as Fulham struck against the run of play five minutes before the break, with Jimenez powering home a header from Andreas Pereira's corner. Nevertheless, the visitors levelled within six minutes of the restart, Evanilson latching onto Hill's long ball in behind the Fulham defence before volleying past Leno from a tight angle. Kepa Arrizabalaga thwarted Jimenez’s header and Leno denied Philip Billing before Fulham restored their advantage in the 72nd minute, with Wilson powering home a header from Antonee Robinson’s cross. However, Bournemouth rescued themselves in the dying moments of regulation time as the ball broke kindly for Ouattara, who calmly lifted over Leno, with the goal awarded following a VAR review to check a potential foul in the build-up. Fulham pegged back twice
Fulham were fresh from their dramatic turnaround against west London rivals Chelsea on Boxing Day, though they seemed to struggle to build on that momentum early in the contest. But after surviving several scares, including Hill’s disallowed header, they landed the first blow just before half-time, as Jimenez superbly attacked Pereira’s corner for his sixth goal of the season. Although they conceded early in the second half, the hosts did not let their heads drop and continued to push forward in a bid to regain their lead, which they eventually did through Wilson. However, Silva’s side could not hold on for a second successive victory, with the ball ricocheting kindly for Ouattara to deny them all three points. Nevertheless, Fulham are now unbeaten in seven straight Premier League matches for the first time since 2010 under Mark Hughes, and they appear to be genuine contenders for European football. However, their efforts initially went without reward once again, as they could not convert their early pressure into the opening goal, with Fulham capitalising from their first real opportunity through Jimenez. Iraola’s side were looking to record four successive Premier League away wins for the second time in as many seasons, though simply securing a point became their primary objective when Wilson’s header put the hosts back in front.",Fulham_2024-12-29,bournemouth,marco-silva,andoni-iraola,2,2,19,3,1,52,1.11,1,11,6,1,7,485,26,16,1,0,6,0,3,2,8,3,0,0,21,1,0,387,22,52,24,0,56,8,52,15,10,26,11,53,31,1,6,0.4423,1,0,6,48,1.98,3,16,4,7,16,439,12,7,3,0,9,0,6,1,12,4,1,1,31,2,0,348,29,70,20,0,44,14,26,26,8,12,9,57,22,0,4,0.4243,1,1,7

Andoni Iraola’s team remain sixth in the Premier League table and one point ahead of Marco Silva's men, who stay eighth. How the match unfolded
Bournemouth created the better opportunities during the first half. The Cherries thought they had taken the lead when James Hill headed in from a corner, only to be denied for a push on Calvin Bassey. However, Bournemouth rescued themselves in the dying moments of regulation time as the ball broke kindly for Ouattara, who calmly lifted over Leno, with the goal awarded following a VAR review to check a potential foul in the build-up. Bournemouth bounce back 
With fourth-placed Chelsea not playing until Monday, Bournemouth had the opportunity to move within three points of the Champions League places. Following their goalless draw with Crystal Palace on Boxing Day, Iraola urged his players to demonstrate a more clinical edge in front of goal. Nevertheless, the Cherries responded well after the break and were soon back on level terms through Evanilson’s instinctive finish. Iraola’s side were looking to record four successive Premier League away wins for the second time in as many seasons, though simply securing a point became their primary objective when Wilson’s header put the hosts back in front. To their credit, Bournemouth continued to plug away and, though the ball broke kindly for them in the box, they capitalised on their good fortune with Ouattara’s lovely finish bringing them level again. Also unbeaten in seven matches at the end of 2024, the Cherries begin 2025 at home to 16th-placed Everton next weekend.",Bournemouth_2024-12-29,fulham,andoni-iraola,marco-silva,2,2,19,3,0,48,1.98,3,16,4,7,16,439,12,7,3,0,9,0,6,1,12,4,1,1,31,2,0,348,29,70,20,0,44,14,26,26,8,12,9,57,22,0,4,0.4243,1,1,7,52,1.11,1,11,6,1,7,485,26,16,1,0,6,0,3,2,8,3,0,0,21,1,0,387,22,52,24,0,56,8,52,15,10,26,11,53,31,1,6,0.4423,1,0,6
528,528,west-ham-united,2024-12-09,"West Ham United beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 at the London Stadium to ease the pressure on head coach Julen Lopetegui. Monday's match was billed as a vital one for both clubs, with Lopetegui and his counterpart Gary O'Neil seeing their positions called into question after damaging defeats last week. But West Ham, who also saw a Mohammed Kudus strike overturned following a VAR review at 1-0 up, restored their lead through Jarrod Bowen's cultured finish only two minutes and 17 seconds later. West Ham remain 14th, but with their cushion to the bottom three increased to nine points. How the match unfolded
Neither side was able to find the breakthrough in the opening period, with Joao Gomes steering wide when presented with a glaring chance in between Bowen and Kudus working goalkeeper Sam Johnstone. But West Ham hit the front nine minutes into the second half, with Soucek left unmarked at the back post as he headed Bowen's corner over Johnstone and the covering Gomes on the line. Kudus was found to be marginally offside following a VAR review when turning in Bowen's cross for what West Ham thought was a second, and Wolves made the most of that reprieve as Doherty sent a low volley past Lukasz Fabianski from 12 yards. West Ham's response was rapid, though, as Bowen turned Goncalo Guedes with ease and curled the ball into the bottom-left corner for what proved to be the winner. Perfect tribute to Antonio
West Ham were rocked on Saturday by the news that the club's all-time record Premier League goalscorer Michail Antonio was involved in a road traffic accident, after which he underwent surgery on a lower limb fracture. Bowen then celebrated what proved to be the winning goal by holding Antonio's shirt up high at pitchside. This was another captain's performance from Bowen, who assisted Soucek's opener and brilliantly found the net to earn his side – and head coach Lopetegui – a much-needed win. With AFC Bournemouth and Brighton & Hove Albion up next before Christmas, the Hammers will now hope to finally build some positive momentum under the Spaniard. The visitors had a couple of penalty appeals turned down, with a VAR review at 1-0 deeming a risky Emerson challenge on Guedes to have taken place marginally outside the area. Club reports

Monday's match was billed as a vital one for both clubs, with Lopetegui and his counterpart Gary O'Neil seeing their positions called into question after damaging defeats last week. Wolves wing-back Matt Doherty struck a rare goal to cancel out Tomas Soucek's looping header with 21 minutes remaining, as things livened up after a tepid first half. Wolves were unable to find a second leveller as they fell to a third successive loss, a result that leaves them 19th in the Premier League table and four points from fourth-bottom Crystal Palace.

Widespread media reports had suggested prior to this contest that the position of the losing coach could be under further pressure. This was a third defeat in a row for Wolves, who have been dragged back into the mire after appearing to steady the ship with a four-match unbeaten run that earned O'Neil a nomination for November's Manager of the Month award. O'Neil's side did well to get themselves back on level terms but were poor defensively once again and have now conceded 38 goals this season – including 15 from set-pieces. Wolves host an Ipswich Town side on Saturday who are also on nine points. O'Neil will hope a return to Molineux can help them get back to winning ways, but after another damaging defeat, he will hope to still be at the helm. Club reports

530,530,everton,2024-12-29,"Nottingham Forest moved into second place in the Premier League after beating Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park. Chris Wood put them ahead in the 15th minute after combining well with Anthony Elanga before lofting the ball over Jordan Pickford for his 11th league goal of the season. Morgan Gibbs-White doubled Forest’s tally just after the hour, with Wood turning provider, and only a fine double save from Pickford denied the visitors a third late on. Forest’s win moves them, at least temporarily, above Chelsea and Arsenal ahead of their respective fixtures on Monday and Wednesday, while Everton sit 16th. How the match unfolded
Fresh from impressive draws against Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, Everton started brightly, with Iliman Ndiaye neatly turning Nikola Milenkovic on the edge of the box before blazing the ball over Matz Sels’ net. Yet Forest dealt the first blow, with Wood finishing coolly over Pickford after a neat headed exchange with Elanga. But Nuno’s side doubled their advantage in the 61st minute when they pounced on a mix-up in Everton’s defence, with Gibbs-White chopping inside before finishing beyond Pickford. Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Beto were thrown on by Sean Dyche as Everton searched for a way back into the contest, though the hosts had their goalkeeper to thank for keeping Forest to two when he saved well from Elanga before denying Taiwo Awoniyi on the rebound. Dyche’s defensive resilience broken
Everton have prided themselves on defensively solidity in recent weeks, but despite holding the Premier League’s elite sides to draws in December, the Toffees came unstuck against Forest, who remained compact at the back and ruthless in attack. Ndiaye’s early attempt offered the Goodison faithful some hope, but the stern defensive rearguard that had seen Everton concede just once across their previous four league matches was punctured by a moment of quality from Wood. Everton pushed for the equaliser, with Jarrad Branthwaite heading over Ashley Young’s inviting corner, before Armando Broja, making his first start for the club, wildly lashed his strike wide moments before the break. Jesper Lindstrom’s introduction at the interval attempted to inject some pace into the Everton attack, with the Dane curling an effort over the bar after good work from Abdoulaye Doucoure. But Everton were punished when a combination of Doucoure’s poor pass and Vitalii Mykolenko’s hesitation allowing Gibbs-White to seal the win for Forest, with substitutes Calvert-Lewin and Beto seeing headers saved in the closing stages. While Everton ended 2024 with a defeat, they will be hoping for a winning start to 2025 away to AFC Bournemouth next Saturday. And Wood, one of Dyche’s former Burnley stalwarts, helped punish his old manager midway through the second half when he teed up Gibbs-White to put Forest two goals to the good. Only Pickford’s saves kept Forest from adding further gloss as they sealed a first league win at Goodison since 1999. What the managers said

Nuno Espirito Santo’s team have now reeled off five consecutive top-flight victories – it is the first time Forest have won as many Premier League matches in a row since 1995.

Having eclipsed their entire points total from last season with their win over Tottenham Hotspur last time out, Forest are in dreamland at the top. Preparations were slightly altered moments before kick-off when key defender Murillo was injured in the warm-up and replaced by Sosa, though Forest did not let that setback disrupt their start with Wood volleying their first effort at goal just wide. The New Zealander went close again when he glanced Elanga’s cross past the far-right post, but the pair combined to great effect shortly after, with Gibbs-White’s punt forward brilliantly worked between them before Wood opened the scoring.

Eberechi Eze’s neat flick released Jean-Philippe Mateta, who stung Mark Flekken's palms with a fierce strike, while Dean Henderson got down well to claw away Yoane Wissa’s deflected low drive at the other end. The hosts almost took the lead after the break when Eze’s free-kick deflected onto the post, but it was Brentford who struck first in the 66th minute following Maxence Lacroix’s trip on Nathan Collins.

Eagles' unbeaten streak grounded
Oliver Glasner’s side appeared to have turned a corner recently, with a run of five Premier League games without defeat lifting them to 12th in the table. Their confidence was evident as they made a positive start, with Eze getting a shot away inside the opening 15 seconds. Mateta also called Flekken into action, while it took a brilliant last-ditch sliding challenge from Collins to deny Eze another sight of goal. The woodwork then thwarted Palace and Eze with his 57th-minute free-kick, which almost snuck in after a big deflection off the wall, before they fell behind to the retaken penalty. However, it just proved too little too late for the Eagles, who suffered their first defeat in seven home league meetings with Brentford, and now Glasner will seek a response from his players when he takes them to Old Trafford to face Manchester United next Sunday.

And after maintaining their defensive discipline for so long, they edged their noses in front via Mbeumo’s penalty – albeit in somewhat fortuitous circumstances. Although, after Schade doubled the lead, Esse ensured they would be in for a nervy finish, especially considering Brentford had conceded six Premier League goals in the 90th minute or later this season. Nevertheless, Frank’s side held out to make it back-to-back away league wins for the first time in nearly 18 months.

534,534,crystal-palace,2024-12-29,"Eberechi Eze scored a second-half winner as Crystal Palace came from behind to round out the year with a crucial 2-1 victory over struggling Southampton at Selhurst Park. But Palace rallied well and got back on level terms before half-time with a Trevoh Chalobah header from a corner, despite Southampton’s complaints that goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale was impeded. The home side took the lead seven minutes after the break as Eze struck a powerful effort past Ramsdale from just outside the penalty area, and they held on for all three points. A win for Palace sees them move above Everton into 15th position, while Southampton remain bottom with just one win and six points to show for their efforts across the first half of the season. The first real chance of the game went Palace’s way, with Jean-Philippe Mateta teeing up Eze 12 yards out but the England international’s shot was straight at Ramsdale. Palace found an equaliser just after the half-hour mark when a corner by Will Hughes was bundled in by Chalobah despite Ramsdale’s pleas that he was obstructed by Mateta, before the keeper was forced to make a fine one-handed stop to deny Ismalia Sarr. Palace continued to perform the better of the two sides and they claimed the lead early in the second half, as Eze smartly fired in after Saints struggled to clear their lines. Palace end 2024 on a high 
Marc Guehi’s suspension for this game was a blow for Oliver Glasner’s men, and his absence was keenly felt early on, as Palace initially struggled with Southampton’s direct approach and conceded a very soft goal by their standards. However, despite going behind, Palace responded well and could easily have been ahead by half-time, having dominated large parts of the opening half and created plenty of chances. Mateta grew into the game too, often getting the better of Jan Bednarek in the air and drawing in Southampton’s three central defenders, which in turn created space for the likes of Sarr and Eze to exploit. Eze capped his own fine performance, which included a skilful dink over Taylor Harwood-Bellis to win a free kick, with a fantastic goal out of nothing, and his form may prove crucial in the early parts of 2025 as Palace look to continue their recovery from a difficult start and move further up the table. Glasner will hope his side, boosted by the return of Guehi, can continue keep up the momentum from this display when they host Chelsea in a London derby on January 4. But Palace snuffed out the supply as the match progressed and he was ultimately substituted after 65 minutes. Indeed, after a strong opening Saints were second best as they struggled to contain a Palace onslaught and they continue to concede soft goals, with weak defending contributing to Chalobah’s goal and a failure to deal with a looping aerial ball proving detrimental for the second.

Mateta grew into the game too, often getting the better of Jan Bednarek in the air and drawing in Southampton’s three central defenders, which in turn created space for the likes of Sarr and Eze to exploit. Indeed, after a strong opening Saints were second best as they struggled to contain a Palace onslaught and they continue to concede soft goals, with weak defending contributing to Chalobah’s goal and a failure to deal with a looping aerial ball proving detrimental for the second. A home victory against Brentford in their first match of 2025 next Saturday is of the upmost importance if Southampton are going to mount an improbable escape from relegation in the second half of the season.

536,536,tottenham-hotspur,2025-01-26,"Leicester City ended their seven-match losing run and moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-1 turnaround win to pile on the pressure for Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou. Ruud van Nistelrooy's strugglers knew a defeat in north London would see them equal their worst-ever streak in league action, and they fell behind to a first-half header from returning striker Richarlison. Leicester are one point clear of the bottom three and seven behind 15th-placed Spurs. How the match unfolded
Jakub Stolarczyk was again busy in the Leicester goal early on, parrying Pedro Porro's strike then making a wonderful save to prevent Son Heung-min from finding the bottom corner. Van Nistelrooy's side were then fortunate to see a Son cross clip the crossbar, but they had no such luck when Spurs went ahead in the 33rd minute. Porro whipped an inviting cross in from the right, with Richarlison escaping Wout Faes and James Justin to head home from close range. However, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was stunned into silence by two quickfire goals to start the second half - Vardy first equalised with a tap-in after goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky failed to gather Bobby De Cordova-Reid's cross. Porro saw a free-kick rattle the crossbar after a wicked deflection off Vardy, but that was as close as Spurs came before the final whistle. Postecoglou's problems mount
Postecoglou said in the build-up to Sunday's match that injuries were solely responsible for Spurs' poor form. With Guglielmo Vicario, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson, Dominic Solanke, Timo Werner and James Maddison among their absentees, it is fair to say the Australian has been working with his hands tied. He did receive one major boost as Richarlison was fit to make his first Premier League start this season, and the Brazilian was in the right place with his stooping header to put Spurs ahead. However, by the time Richarlison was withdrawn in the 54th minute the contest had been flipped entirely. Porro was the only member of Spurs' first-choice back four to start, but both Leicester goals came from his flank. While Spurs remain easy on the eye going forward, such mistakes have become far too commonplace, with 13 defeats in 23 league matches a poor return for a team once tipped for the top four. Postecoglou will hope to have players such as Maddison available for next Saturday, when they face a trip to Brentford. Leicester avoid unwanted history
Spurs were not the only side desperately needing a result on Sunday, with things looking bleak for Leicester following a 2-0 loss at home to Fulham last time out. Van Nistelrooy's team have seen their goal peppered with shots in recent matches, and only the efforts of Stolarczyk prevented Spurs from taking a more handsome lead into half-time. The former Fulham man unsettled Spurs' backline by leading the Leicester press, also showing composure in the final third to record two assists. The league's bottom four teams have threatened to be cut adrift in recent weeks, but Leicester will now hope to drag 16th-placed Everton into the relegation fight when they visit Goodison Park next Saturday.

However, two goals in the first five minutes of the second half turned Sunday's match on its head, with Jamie Vardy levelling just 57 seconds after the restart. Bilal El Khannouss then put Leicester ahead with a curler from just outside the penalty area, and the Foxes clung on to leapfrog Wolverhampton Wanderers and go 17th in the table. Leicester are one point clear of the bottom three and seven behind 15th-placed Spurs. How the match unfolded
Jakub Stolarczyk was again busy in the Leicester goal early on, parrying Pedro Porro's strike then making a wonderful save to prevent Son Heung-min from finding the bottom corner.

Porro saw a free-kick rattle the crossbar after a wicked deflection off Vardy, but that was as close as Spurs came before the final whistle. Porro was the only member of Spurs' first-choice back four to start, but both Leicester goals came from his flank. He was nowhere to be seen as De Cordova-Reid crossed for Vardy's leveller, then his ill-advised pass saw Bentancur lose possession for the second. Leicester avoid unwanted history
Spurs were not the only side desperately needing a result on Sunday, with things looking bleak for Leicester following a 2-0 loss at home to Fulham last time out. Supporters at King Power Stadium voiced their frustrations at the end of that defeat, with the Foxes threatening to equal their worst-ever losing run in the league - a streak of eight defeats between March and April 2001. The former Fulham man unsettled Spurs' backline by leading the Leicester press, also showing composure in the final third to record two assists. El Khannouss, meanwhile, gave another glimpse of his Premier League qualities by bending a wonderful finish just inside the post from 20 yards out, scoring his first goal since Leicester's most recent win, a 3-1 triumph over West Ham United on 3 December - Van Nistelrooy's first match in charge. The league's bottom four teams have threatened to be cut adrift in recent weeks, but Leicester will now hope to drag 16th-placed Everton into the relegation fight when they visit Goodison Park next Saturday.

Forest and Villa entered Saturday's late kick-off fifth and sixth in the standings respectively, with both knowing a victory would lift them into the UEFA Champions League places. Chris Wood saw a potential leveller disallowed for offside following a VAR review, but Forest continued to push for an equaliser and drew level courtesy of a powerful Nikola Milenkovic header in the 87th minute. Substitute Elanga then completed the turnaround four minutes into stoppage time, side-footing home to ensure Forest climbed above Manchester City with 28 points, and three ahead of Villa. How the match unfolded
Neither side carved out a chance of note in the first half-hour, with Forest centre-back Murillo the first to go close when he planted a header wide from Elliot Anderson's corner. Forest went agonisingly close to opening the scoring after 60 minutes, but Emiliano Martinez sensationally clawed Nicolas Dominguez's stooping header off the goal line. Forest thought they had levelled with eight minutes remaining as Wood slid Elanga's cross home, but a VAR review established the latter had been offside after being slipped in behind by Morgan Gibbs-White, overturning Samuel Barrott's on-field decision to award the goal. Nuno Espirito Santo's team would not be denied, though, with Martinez powerless to stop Milenkovic's thumping header from creeping over the line. Villa were then left shellshocked in stoppage time, with Anderson getting to the byline before finding Elanga, who sparked wild celebrations with a calm finish into the net. Forest dig deep for statement win
Forest have managed to make the City Ground a fortress lately, winning three of their last four home Premier League matches ahead of Villa's visit. Having seen their team emerge as surprise contenders for a European place, the home fans were hoping to see a statement performance – Forest had lost each of their last six Premier League matches when starting the day inside the division's top five places. However, Nuno will argue his team made their own luck by producing a fighting performance. Refusing to let their heads drop after Wood saw a potential equaliser chalked off, Forest laid siege to the Villa area and always looked the more likely victors as the game entered stoppage time. Forest could be displaced from the top four when Manchester City face Manchester United on Sunday, but something special is in the air on the banks of the River Trent. Those away-day struggles would ultimately continue on Saturday, with Milenkovic and Elanga taking advantage of some slack defending to flip the contest on its head at the death. Club reports

Forest and Villa entered Saturday's late kick-off fifth and sixth in the standings respectively, with both knowing a victory would lift them into the UEFA Champions League places. Chances were few and far between until the second half, when Jhon Duran – having replaced Ollie Watkins in the Villa attack – opened the scoring with a fine header. Substitute Elanga then completed the turnaround four minutes into stoppage time, side-footing home to ensure Forest climbed above Manchester City with 28 points, and three ahead of Villa. Forest went agonisingly close to opening the scoring after 60 minutes, but Emiliano Martinez sensationally clawed Nicolas Dominguez's stooping header off the goal line. Villa made that reprieve count three minutes later, Duran producing a wonderful, floated header from John McGinn's cross to beat Matz Sels.

Villa were then left shellshocked in stoppage time, with Anderson getting to the byline before finding Elanga, who sparked wild celebrations with a calm finish into the net. Forest dig deep for statement win
Forest have managed to make the City Ground a fortress lately, winning three of their last four home Premier League matches ahead of Villa's visit. Villa felt they were unfortunate to be denied a penalty when Morgan Rogers went down under pressure from Anderson in the first half, and they also appealed for a foul when Anderson pressed high to dispossess Matty Cash in the build-up to the winning goal. Refusing to let their heads drop after Wood saw a potential equaliser chalked off, Forest laid siege to the Villa area and always looked the more likely victors as the game entered stoppage time. Duran heroics not enough
Unai Emery's visitors entered this game having lost three in a row on their travels in the Premier League, their worst away run of form under the Spaniard. However, if any Villa player deserved to come out of the game with some credit to his name, it was Duran. Duran scored with a stunning, long-range effort after coming off the bench to replace Watkins at half-time as Villa beat RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Tuesday. Duran has now scored on all five of his starts for Villa in all competitions this season and will be confident of keeping his place in the starting XI when Pep Guardiola’s side visit Villa Park next Saturday. The main task for Villa, though, will be sharpening up at the other end. Club reports

540,540,wolverhampton,2024-12-14,"Jack Taylor scored a stoppage-time winner as Ipswich Town secured a vital 2-1 victory over fellow relegation battlers Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Both teams entered the match off the back of three successive defeats, with Wolves – and their head coach Gary O'Neil – under pressure at Molineux. A Matt Doherty own goal handed the Tractor Boys a first-half lead, only for Matheus Cunha to tee up a grandstand finish with his 72nd-minute leveller. However, it was Ipswich who took all three points, with Wolves' set-piece failings haunting them once again as Taylor nodded Jack Clarke's last-gasp corner home in the fourth minute of added time. The result moves 18th-placed Ipswich one point off Crystal Palace in 17th, while Wolves remain 19th, four points adrift of safety. His shot was blocked on the line by Doherty, but Conor Chaplin’s strike hit Toti Gomes before bouncing in off Doherty. Wolves had two glorious chances to equalise before half-time. But, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde blasted over after being teed up beautifully by Mario Lemina, while Arijanet Muric held on to a tame finish from Jorgen Strand Larsen. Wolves made those let-offs count when Cunha thrashed an effort past Muric at his near post. Crisis point at Molineux?
It has been an eventful few days at Wolves, and this latest defeat will only deepen the mood around the club. On Friday, O'Neil confirmed Lemina had relinquished the captaincy after his reaction to Monday's 2-1 defeat at West Ham – the midfielder had tangled with Jarrod Bowen at the final whistle and had to be restrained by team-mates before clashing with first-team coach Shaun Derry. Despite that loss Wolves chairman Jeff Shi insisted O'Neil retained the club's backing ahead of Saturday's game. The frustration around Molineux was evident from the moment Chaplin's rebounded effort rolled in off Doherty, and but for some wasteful finishing from Delap, Ipswich could have been out of sight early in the second half. As has been the case so often this season, a moment of brilliance from Cunha rescued Wolves, but they failed to make the most of a dominant spell after drawing level and were hit with a late sucker punch.

The result moves 18th-placed Ipswich one point off Crystal Palace in 17th, while Wolves remain 19th, four points adrift of safety. How the match unfolded
After a nervy start from both sides, Ipswich took the lead from their first real venture forward in the 15th minute. Liam Delap showed great endeavour and strength to latch on to a long ball and fend off Nelson Semedo to cross for Omari Hutchinson. Sam Johnstone was required to keep out Wes Burns' stinging shot early in the second half, then Delap failed to connect with Burns' cross with the goal gaping. The frustration around Molineux was evident from the moment Chaplin's rebounded effort rolled in off Doherty, and but for some wasteful finishing from Delap, Ipswich could have been out of sight early in the second half. McKenna’s men show their fight
Ipswich had also endured a difficult few days ahead of their trip to the West Midlands, going down to Crystal Palace and AFC Bournemouth in back-to-back games at Portman Road. They were facing the prospect of suffering four straight league defeats for the very first time under Kieran McKenna, but showed real fight and determination to snatch three vital points on Saturday. Ipswich showed their quality in attack in the early stages, with Delap chasing what appeared to be a lost cause in the build-up to their opening goal, which admittedly had more than a hint of fortune about it. One major problem for the Tractor Boys this season has been squandering leads, having already dropped 15 points from winning positions ahead of Saturday's match, the most in the Premier League.",Ipswich_2024-12-14,wolverhampton,kieran-mckenna,vitor-pereira,2,1,16,2,0,46,1.2,2,10,5,3,9,420,12,13,3,0,5,0,2,3,7,3,2,0,32,3,4,350,11,51,19,0,48,12,36,15,11,12,12,66,31,2,5,0.4616,1,4,6,54,1.27,1,16,2,7,13,499,20,9,2,1,6,0,5,5,11,5,1,1,26,2,2,418,19,61,21,0,52,9,44,12,15,20,6,63,19,0,2,-1.0459,1,1,3
542,542,leicester-city,2024-12-29,"Savinho and Erling Haaland scored the goals as Manchester City got back to winning ways in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory at Leicester City. In Pep Guardiola’s 500th game in charge of the club, the visitors stuttered and staggered for much of Sunday’s contest, but ultimately got over the line at the King Power Stadium. Leicester had their chances against a vulnerable-looking Man City defence, with Jamie Vardy slicing over from their best opportunity, and their profligacy was punished. How the match unfolded
After Haaland had a close-range shot saved by Jakub Stolarczyk, Leicester wanted a penalty when Stefan Ortega clattered into Vardy, though the Foxes striker was flagged offside, with the VAR confirming the decision. Haaland drilled just wide at the culmination of a fantastic run, and Leicester almost punished City for that miss when Facundo Buonanotte capitalised on slack marking to head towards goal, only to hit a post. Manuel Akanji cleared off the line from James Justin in the 62nd minute, yet the clearest chance of the match fell to Vardy soon after, as he failed to divert a close-range volley under the bar. The away fans sarcastically chanted ""City are staying up"" to the tune of ""Three Lions"" after Savinho’s goal, but for much of this encounter, it was the relegation-battling Foxes who were on top. Leicester left to rue missed chances
The Foxes have now lost four straight league matches, but matters might have been so different had they just been able to take their opportunities when they came. It is no exaggeration to say Leicester looked more like the team competing at the top end of the table for much of the game, yet they just lacked the cutting edge required. Vardy’s miss shortly before Haaland made it 2-0 will go down as the standout opportunity squandered, but the Foxes created plenty of other openings. Referee Michael Oliver fairly dismissed Leicester’s penalty appeals after Buonanotte took a tumble under pressure from Nathan Ake in a promising opening shortly after the break, and Akanji had to be in the right place to scoop Justin’s attempt clear off the line soon after. Vardy had Ortega scrambling late on with a header that clipped the crossbar, but Leicester got nothing for all their endeavour. Club reports

In Pep Guardiola’s 500th game in charge of the club, the visitors stuttered and staggered for much of Sunday’s contest, but ultimately got over the line at the King Power Stadium. Savinho arrowed in his first goal for the club in the 21st minute, before turning provider for Haaland to head in a decisive second with 16 minutes remaining. Leicester had their chances against a vulnerable-looking Man City defence, with Jamie Vardy slicing over from their best opportunity, and their profligacy was punished. Ruud van Nistelrooy’s team stay 18th in the table, while Guardiola's men moved to within four points of fourth-placed Chelsea, who face Ipswich Town on Monday. How the match unfolded
After Haaland had a close-range shot saved by Jakub Stolarczyk, Leicester wanted a penalty when Stefan Ortega clattered into Vardy, though the Foxes striker was flagged offside, with the VAR confirming the decision. But after thwarting Haaland earlier on, Stolarczyk should have done better when parrying Phil Foden’s shot. Haaland drilled just wide at the culmination of a fantastic run, and Leicester almost punished City for that miss when Facundo Buonanotte capitalised on slack marking to head towards goal, only to hit a post. City made their luck count as substitute James McAtee did well to cut inside from the right and link with Kevin De Bruyne, who switched the play out to Savinho. The Brazilian then crossed in for Haaland to head home from the visitors’ first attempt of the second half. Man City unconvincing, but get the job done
Guardiola may have marked his milestone Man City match with a victory, but his team’s performance will have done little to allay fears over their form. The away fans sarcastically chanted ""City are staying up"" to the tune of ""Three Lions"" after Savinho’s goal, but for much of this encounter, it was the relegation-battling Foxes who were on top. There were flashes of Man City excellence. Haaland embarked on an impressive run before he dragged wide midway through the first half, while the Norwegian also headed at Stolarczyk after great work from Bernardo Silva down the left flank. First, the Brazilian finished brilliantly from a tight angle to break the deadlock, before he supplied the left-footed cross from which Haaland made sure of the points. In years gone by, a Man City opener against one of the teams struggling down at the bottom would likely have resulted in Guardiola’s team putting their foot on the pedal. Instead, they rather laboured to a much-needed win – just their second victory in 14 games across all competitions – though getting that triumph on the board likely mattered more for Guardiola than the nature of the performance. Vardy’s miss shortly before Haaland made it 2-0 will go down as the standout opportunity squandered, but the Foxes created plenty of other openings. There was a teasing ball flashed across the face of goal by Bilal El Khannouss in the 33rd minute, before static Man City defending allowed Buonanotte a free header following a bit of pinball in the visitors’ area – the woodwork left rattled on that occasion.

544,544,manchester-united,2024-12-30,"Newcastle United recorded their fourth straight Premier League win after a 2-0 victory over struggling Manchester United at Old Trafford. Newcastle doubled their lead in similar fashion soon after, with Joelinton rising above Lisandro Martinez to bundle past Andre Onana, while only the offside flag prevented Isak from adding a third. Substitute Leny Yoro also headed wide from a corner as the breakthrough ultimately eluded the Red Devils, with Newcastle comfortably seeing out only a second Premier League win at Old Trafford. Amorim’s torrid start continues
Never before in the Premier League era had the Red Devils suffered three straight league defeats at Old Trafford, last doing so in 1979. Amorim made the bold call to replace Joshua Zirkzee after just 33 minutes, though the introduction of Kobbie Mainoo certainly redressed the balance in the middle of the park. The hosts definitely improved thereon and were unfortunate not to reduce their arrears, though the damage was already done by those two first-half goals, with the returning Marcus Rashford made to watch on from the bench. Occupying 14th place – their lowest position at the turn of a year in the Premier League era – things do not get any easier for United, who travel to Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday, before an FA Cup trip to Arsenal the following weekend. Magpies continue to soar
Only once in the past half a century had Newcastle enjoyed a league victory at Old Trafford, with Yohan Cabaye their hero on this ground in a 1-0 win in December 2013. Match reports

545,545,newcastle-united,2024-12-30,"Newcastle United recorded their fourth straight Premier League win after a 2-0 victory over struggling Manchester United at Old Trafford. First-half headers from Alexander Isak and Joelinton kept the high-flying Magpies in fifth place, while condemning Ruben Amorim’s side to a third successive league defeat. Just over three minutes had been played when Isak nodded home his 12th goal of the season from Lewis Hall’s cross. Joelinton made it 2-0 inside the opening 20 minutes and, though their opponents improved as the contest wore on, the visitors were never in genuine danger of surrendering their advantage. Eddie Howe’s side climbed to fifth and within three points of fourth-place Chelsea, who were beaten by struggling Ipswich Town at Portman Road, while the Red Devils remain 14th. How the match unfolded
The Magpies made a confident start and were 1-0 up inside just four minutes as superb build-up in the middle of the park led to Hall’s inviting cross being nodded home by Isak. Newcastle doubled their lead in similar fashion soon after, with Joelinton rising above Lisandro Martinez to bundle past Andre Onana, while only the offside flag prevented Isak from adding a third. Substitute Leny Yoro also headed wide from a corner as the breakthrough ultimately eluded the Red Devils, with Newcastle comfortably seeing out only a second Premier League win at Old Trafford. But the struggles of their current crop of players was evident with Newcastle allowed to quickly stamp their authority on proceedings. Twice, Amorim’s side were overrun in midfield before they failed to deal with a cross from the left flank that culminated in a goal, with Isak and Joelinton profiting. Magpies continue to soar
Only once in the past half a century had Newcastle enjoyed a league victory at Old Trafford, with Yohan Cabaye their hero on this ground in a 1-0 win in December 2013. However, if that was on the minds of Howe’s players, it certainly did not show. Newcastle quickly settled into their rhythm and their confidence was flowing from the kick-off. Isak is very much the Premier League’s man in form, and he was in the right place at the right time once again to find the net for a sixth consecutive game. Joelinton was then on target for a second successive match and, in fairness, the visitors could count themselves unfortunate not to have further increased their advantage – Sandro Tonali going the closest when he hit a post. Although their opponents rallied, Newcastle remained stubborn defensively with several crucial blocks to keep them at bay while preserving their lead and, ultimately, a fourth straight victory without conceding.

546,546,aston-villa,2025-01-26,"A second-half header from Emerson earned West Ham United a deserved 1-1 draw with Aston Villa, as Graham Potter's team produced an encouraging display at Villa Park. The wing-back stole round the back to nod Edson Alvarez's cross home after 70 minutes as Villa's midweek UEFA Champions League exploits appeared to take their toll. But Villa appeared to run out of steam and were put on the back foot by the Hammers in the second half, with Danny Ings and Lucas Paqueta both going close to a winner. The draw sees West Ham move 11 points clear of the bottom three, while Villa remain eighth, four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City. How the match unfolded
Unai Emery's hosts swarmed all over West Ham in the early stages, taking the lead after just eight minutes. A superb one-two between Ramsey and Ollie Watkins saw the former run through on goal and finish neatly with his left foot for his first Premier League strike since September 2023. Morgan Rogers also had the ball in the net two minutes later, but Watkins was flagged offside in the build-up. Ramsey back in business
It has been so long since Ramsey broke into Villa's first team that it is easily forgotten he is still 23 years old and very much the club's future, as well as its present. He sent out a reminder of his exciting talent by opening the scoring early on at Villa Park, brilliantly latching on to Watkins' return pass before powering into the box to score. While Emery will be delighted that Ramsey is fit and firing, there will be real concern about Mings. Mings attempted to play on before hanging his head as he hobbled off the field and his side flagged without him, Lucas Digne coming on to fill in at centre-back after Emery was forced into a reshuffle. Still, while Potter will be encouraged by this display, reported interest in Villa substitute Jhon Duran makes sense. The striker cannot nail down a regular place in Villa's side and would add an obvious threat having scored seven Premier League goals this season. Club reports

Unai Emery's hosts swarmed all over West Ham in the early stages, taking the lead after just eight minutes. The first half ended on a sombre note for the hosts, though, as Mings hobbled off looking distraught after taking a knock to his left knee in a collision with Mohammed Kudus. West Ham equalised with a well-worked effort 20 minutes from time, though, as Alvarez's cross was headed in by the unmarked Emerson at the back post. Substitute Ings then went close to earning all three points with a fizzing effort as West Ham ended the stronger of the two sides. The defender was missing from August 2023 to October 2024 after sustaining a serious knee injury and could not continue here after being on the receiving end of a firm – but fair – Kudus challenge. Encouragement for Potter
Potter set West Ham up with a back three but the starting XI he named was a reminder of the gaps in his squad. And Potter is still operating without a natural centre-forward, too, with Jarrod Bowen, Crysencio Summerville, Michail Antonio and Niclas Fullkrug all injured, but West Ham's performance defied those issues. Fortunately, one of their defenders had his sights set accurately, Emerson appearing at the far post to nod in, and only one team looked like winning from then on. Club reports

548,548,fulham,2025-01-26,"Lisandro Martinez's deflected shot earned Manchester United a 1-0 victory at Fulham. A match lacking in quality chances was settled by a huge slice of fortune when Martinez's strike from 30 yards deflected off Sasa Lukic and looped over Bernd Leno in the Fulham goal. Fulham, in fairness, had created little themselves until Joachim Andersen's thumping header was stunningly cleared off the line by substitute Toby Collyer in the closing stages. Victory lifts United up to 12th, while Fulham's hopes of muscling their way into the conversation for European football took a blow, and they remain 10th. How the match unfolded
United mustered just one shot in a first half that Fulham edged. Alex Iwobi was the liveliest player and twice stung the palms of Andre Onana, while Raul Jimenez tried his luck with a couple of efforts that cleared the crossbar. But it was the visitors who struck the telling blow when Martinez tried his luck from range and saw his attempt cruelly loop over Leno. Fulham thought they had an equaliser when Andersen's header looked destined to find the back of the net, only for Collyer to make a sublime clearance off the line. Iwobi a rare bright spark as Fulham falter
There was very little to get the home faithful off their feet in a first half badly lacking in quality and composure. One notable exception was Iwobi, who already has his highest goals tally ever for a single Premier League campaign, with seven. Iwobi was a little more quiet in the second half and, frustratingly for Marco Silva, his side did not really create anything until after United took the lead, with Andersen's header preceding Rodrigo Muniz firing over inside the penalty area. The Cottagers return to league action next weekend against in-form Newcastle United needing a positive result to get their quest for European football next season back on track. Huge slice of luck wins it for visitors
There were cries of ""attack, attack, attack"" from the away end at Craven Cottage – where United remain unbeaten in nine Premier League visits – during a first half that produced little for the highlight reels. Some credit for that, of course, must be given to Fulham, who were typically well drilled and organised – hallmarks of Silva's Craven Cottage tenure. Club reports

United mustered just one shot in a first half that Fulham edged. Alex Iwobi was the liveliest player and twice stung the palms of Andre Onana, while Raul Jimenez tried his luck with a couple of efforts that cleared the crossbar. The second half followed a similar pattern, although there were some United fans who thought Bruno Fernandes' 20-yard free-kick had nestled in the goal, when in reality it found the side-netting. Playing as one of three forwards behind Jimenez, the former Arsenal and Everton man kept finding little pockets of space and put United's defenders on the back foot. Iwobi was a little more quiet in the second half and, frustratingly for Marco Silva, his side did not really create anything until after United took the lead, with Andersen's header preceding Rodrigo Muniz firing over inside the penalty area.

There were cries of ""attack, attack, attack"" from the away end at Craven Cottage – where United remain unbeaten in nine Premier League visits – during a first half that produced little for the highlight reels. But the truth is, those calls were seldom heeded as United struggled to lay a glove on their opponents as some familiar frailties were exposed in attack. At this point of proceedings, a win is a win for Amorim, whose start to life at United has not exactly been sparkling, but the Portuguese will be desperate to get more of a tune out of his team going forward, with Crystal Palace the visitors to Old Trafford next Sunday.

550,550,newcastle-united,2024-12-14,"Newcastle United have ended their four-game Premier League winless streak after beating Leicester City 4-0 at home. Eddie Howe's side put their foot on the gas in the second half as three goals in the first 15 minutes blew Ruud van Nistelrooy's visitors away. Jacob Murphy's calm finish got the ball rolling in the first half as Leicester struggled to contain Newcastle. Bruno Guimaraes nodded home Lewis Hall's flick-on after 47 minutes to double the lead, before the full-back's brilliant low cross was headed home by Alexander Isak three minutes later. Isak then raced through on the counter-attack to tee up Murphy for his second of the game on the hour. Following the victory, Newcastle are 11th in the table and outside the top half on goal difference, while Leicester are 16th. Newcastle dominated the opening stages, as Anthony Gordon forced a diving stop from Mads Hermansen after just seven minutes, before Dan Burn and Guimaraes headed half-chances off the target. That proved to be a warning from hosts as Gordon cut back from the byline, and Murphy calmly steered home his first goal of the season before the break. Hall deserved another assist three minutes later after helping Isak score the third, but a deflection from Conor Coady proved to be the final diversion into the Swede’s path. Nevertheless, Isak nodded home his seventh Premier League goal of the season. With Leicester ragged in the closing stages, Newcastle kept their ruthless edge. Murphy finished off a flowing move and Newcastle scored four Premier League goals in a game for the first time in 2024-25. Hard-running Hall impresses
Howe has tried multiple options at left-back in his time at St. James' Park with Burn stepping across from central defence and Kieran Trippier covering as needed. However, the rise of Hall this season appears to have solved a long-standing problem for the Newcastle boss, with the former Chelsea defender looking his best option in the role. A nodded assist for Guimaraes' goal was his first at home this season and, despite his cross for Isak's header taking a kind deflection, his industry to constantly burst past Gordon shows how confident he is right now. Newcastle fans will be championing his cause for the England national team, while he will hope to retain his place for Newcastle's EFL Cup quarter final against Brentford on 18 December. Foxes fall short despite plenty of effort
Despite the final result, Van Nistelrooy will be happy by the endeavour shown by his players on Tyneside as they struggled to contain a rampant Newcastle. The twin-threat of Gordon and Murphy was clearly highlighted pre-game and, despite the Foxes defence being overrun by Newcastle attacks, Mavididi and McAteer grafted to cover gaps as part of a five-man midfield out of possession.

552,552,liverpool,2025-01-25,"Cody Gakpo scored twice and set up another as Liverpool cruised to a 4-1 win over Ipswich Town at Anfield that maintained their six-point advantage at the Premier League summit. It was a dominant first-half showing from the hosts as goals from Dominik Szoboszlai, Mohamed Salah and Gakpo had them three ahead at the interval. After what had been a one-sided opening 45 minutes, the match became more even as it progressed, but any doubt over the outcome was ended midway through the second half when Gakpo headed in his second from Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross. Jacob Greaves struck with an aerial effort of his own in the last minute to give Ipswich a consolation, but it was otherwise a comfortable afternoon for Liverpool. Liverpool’s title rivals Arsenal were pushed to the limit as they won 1-0 despite being reduced to 10 men at Wolverhampton Wanderers, so the Reds’ lead at the top remains six points with a game in hand on the Gunners. How the match unfolded
Despite some early positivity from Ipswich, Liverpool quickly took control as their attacking power ruthlessly punctured the visitors three times before half-time. Szoboszlai got the ball rolling for Arne Slot's side as he arrowed past Christian Walton from the edge of the box in the 11th minute, before Salah reached 19 league goals for the campaign when he smartly crashed Gakpo's 35th-minute cross into the roof of the net. The intensity inevitably dropped in the second half, as Ipswich battled for pride, but Liverpool's control of possession kept the visitors at arm’s length. Ipswich began to tire as the match progressed, and Gakpo's second goal of the match  arrived via an inch-perfect ball from Alexander-Arnold on 66 minutes, adding extra gloss to the scoreline. Szoboszlai adds new dimension to Liverpool's attack
Liverpool are not short on goal threats in this campaign, with Salah already beating his league tally from last season while Gakpo and Luis Diaz are firmly on course to better their own league totals from 2023/24. However, the one area Liverpool have lacked goals from has been midfield, with Slot opting for greater control over dynamism from deeper areas. Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister have excelled as a deep double act in Slot's debut campaign, but the former is yet to score a league goal, and the latter has only managed one. Slot will not drastically change the direction of his midfield, but the addition of goals via late runs into the box will cause more headaches for opposition defences, as Szoboszlai looks to edge ahead of Curtis Jones as a consistent starter. Liverpool have a stacked fixture schedule coming up, including a hugely testing league trip to AFC Bournemouth next weekend, the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur on 6 February and the rearranged Merseyside derby on 12 February. In stark contrast to Liverpool's ability to spread goals around their team, Ipswich's chances of remaining in the Premier League next season rest heavily on Liam Delap's shoulders. Defeat at Anfield will not define Ipswich's chances of top-flight safety, but McKenna is in clear need of a Plan B for the remainder of the campaign. Club reports

Szoboszlai's breakthrough strike against Ipswich took him up to three league goals for the season and, when playing, he is the midfielder afforded more licence to charge forward. Delap dependence deepens Ipswich's struggles
Ipswich have earned two of their three league wins this season on the road against Spurs and Wolves, but another away success never looked likely here. In stark contrast to Liverpool's ability to spread goals around their team, Ipswich's chances of remaining in the Premier League next season rest heavily on Liam Delap's shoulders. The Englishman has led the line superbly for Ipswich so far this season, with eight league goals scored as the powerful focal point of McKenna's attack. However, he is now on a run of just two goals scored in his last 11 appearances, and he clearly needs more support from those around him, having failed to record a shot in this game and with Ipswich having taken just one point from four matches since beating Chelsea at Portman Road in their last match of 2024. Defeat at Anfield will not define Ipswich's chances of top-flight safety, but McKenna is in clear need of a Plan B for the remainder of the campaign. Club reports

Brighton controlled large periods of the second half as they pushed for an equaliser, but the visitors held out to record successive league victories for the first time since April. Moyes' side remain 16th but move seven points clear of 18th-placed Ipswich Town, while Brighton stay ninth after missing the chance to close the gap on the top four. Brighton sought a response after the break. Kaoru Mitoma – looking to become the first Japanese player to score in three successive Premier League matches – curled an attempt wide, while substitute Georginio Rutter was also narrowly off target from distance. Seagulls' Amex winless run goes on
Following a difficult recent spell of form, Brighton appeared to have turned a corner, having gone seven matches without defeat in all competitions. As Everton kept things tight, making a series of impressive blocks to keep them at bay, the Seagulls saw their winless streak continue at the Amex Stadium. Nevertheless, the Toffees had cause for optimism, having been victorious in two of their last three visits to the Amex Stadium. They did, though, and Moyes punched the air in delight upon hearing the final whistle, giving him the perfect present on the day he joined Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson in the 700 club.

555,555,everton,2025-01-25,"Iliman Ndiaye's first-half penalty secured back-to-back wins for Everton, who edged out Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0. Ndiaye scored for the second match running as the Toffees claimed all three points in what was David Moyes' 700th Premier League match in charge. How the match unfolded
Everton suffered an early blow with a hamstring injury forcing Dominic Calvert-Lewin off after just 13 minutes. Beto shot wide at the other end with what was Everton’s only effort of the second half. Nevertheless, from the 12 attempts they recorded, Jordan Pickford was only forced to save one of them. As Everton kept things tight, making a series of impressive blocks to keep them at bay, the Seagulls saw their winless streak continue at the Amex Stadium. Tenacious Toffees march on
The omens did not appear overly positive for Everton, who had won just one of their last 21 Premier League away matches, while only scoring once in their six most recent outings. Nevertheless, the Toffees had cause for optimism, having been victorious in two of their last three visits to the Amex Stadium. On the backfoot for large periods of the second half, the Toffees were forced to dig really deep. Everton will be confident of building on their recent momentum when they welcome struggling Leicester City to Goodison Park next weekend. Club reports

556,556,liverpool,2024-12-14,"Ten-man Liverpool dropped Premier League points for only the third time this season as they were held in an entertaining 2-2 draw by Fulham. Diogo Jota rescued a point for the Reds, who had Andrew Robertson sent off early on before having to come from behind twice at Anfield. Arne Slot’s side remain top and move five points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who will close the gap to two with victory over Brentford on Sunday, while the visitors climb a place to ninth. Already a goal down, Liverpool were then a man down just six minutes later as Robertson was sent off after catching Harry Wilson late, with the red card upheld following a VAR review. Nevertheless, the hosts appeared rejuvenated after the break and were level within two minutes of the restart, as Mohamed Salah's cross was headed in by an unmarked Gakpo. Robertson dismissed as Reds survive
Fresh from nine straight home victories across all competitions, Liverpool will have been confident of taking that tally into double figures, though they were ultimately grateful to take just a point from the contest. Despite the numerical disadvantage, Slot’s side did well to get themselves back into the game, with Salah’s 100th assist for the club in all competitions setting up Gakpo for the equaliser. Though they fell behind again, the Reds managed to drag themselves level once more through Jota’s well-taken goal. The hosts subsequently pushed for a dramatic winner, with Virgil van Dijk among those seeing late efforts blocked by the stubborn Fulham defence, as they were forced to settle for a point, with Tottenham Hotspur up next for the Reds. Then, in the midst of Liverpool pushing for the winner after Jota’s equaliser, the Cottagers almost grabbed one themselves, with Adama Traore stinging the palms of Alisson in stoppage time. Possibly disappointed not to have held onto their second lead, they can, nevertheless, reflect on a generally good day’s work at Anfield ahead of hosting Southampton a week on Sunday. Club reports

557,557,fulham,2024-12-14,"Ten-man Liverpool dropped Premier League points for only the third time this season as they were held in an entertaining 2-2 draw by Fulham. Marco Silva’s side struck in the 11th minute, with Andreas Pereira volleying home Antonee Robinson’s cross, while Robertson was shown a straight red card for a professional foul soon after. Cody Gakpo equalised early in the second half, and though Rodrigo Muniz restored the Cottagers’ advantage, the returning Jota popped up with a late equaliser to ensure the spoils were shared. How the match unfolded
Fulham broke the deadlock in the 11th minute, after a sweeping move led to an outstretched Pereira turning home at the back post with the aid of a deflection from Robertson. Already a goal down, Liverpool were then a man down just six minutes later as Robertson was sent off after catching Harry Wilson late, with the red card upheld following a VAR review. His deflection then helped Pereira's volley beyond Alisson, before his rash challenge on Wilson after taking a heavy touch left the referee with no alternative option but to give the Scotland international his marching orders. The hosts subsequently pushed for a dramatic winner, with Virgil van Dijk among those seeing late efforts blocked by the stubborn Fulham defence, as they were forced to settle for a point, with Tottenham Hotspur up next for the Reds. Courageous Cottagers hold their own
From the moment they set foot on the pitch, it was clear Fulham would not be intimidated by the prospect of facing the Premier League leaders. Sticking to their usual game plan and displaying plenty of confidence on the ball, the visitors took the lead, with Pereira demonstrating tremendous acrobatics and flexibility to apply the finishing touch to Robinson’s cross. Silva’s side were not deterred after they were pulled level either, edging their noses ahead once more through Muniz’s instinctive finish. Then, in the midst of Liverpool pushing for the winner after Jota’s equaliser, the Cottagers almost grabbed one themselves, with Adama Traore stinging the palms of Alisson in stoppage time.

558,558,ipswich-town,2024-12-30,"Ipswich Town stunned Chelsea with a hard-fought 2-0 win as Liam Delap stole the show in his side's first home win of the Premier League season. Kieran McKenna's team failed to win any of their first nine league matches at Portman Road, but those struggles were halted with an impressive scalp on Monday evening. Delap won and converted a penalty awarded for Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen's lunge in the 12th minute, before setting up Omari Hutchinson to score against his former side early in the second half. A monumental victory lifts Ipswich to 18th in the league table, one point and place behind Wolverhampton Wanderers, while Chelsea's third straight winless outing leaves them fourth. How the match unfolded
Tosin Adarabioyo cleared off the line to prevent Nathan Broadhead from opening the scoring after just four minutes – but Chelsea did not heed that early warning. Jorgensen sliced down the marauding Delap when rushing out of his goal, and the Ipswich striker duly dispatched the penalty he won by slamming into the bottom-left corner. Wes Burns was the unlikely hero to deny Joao Felix's header soon after the interval, the Ipswich man leaping to clear on the line with an intervention that proved pivotal. Eight minutes into the second half, Delap's pace again tormented Tosin when he raced from the halfway line to the box before offloading for Hutchinson, whose drilled finish into the bottom-right corner gave Ipswich breathing room to hold on for a memorable victory. Dominant Delap gives Ipswich hope
It has been a long time coming for McKenna, but Ipswich finally got over the line at Portman Road, with just their third win of the entire season largely inspired by the superb Delap. It was another familiar face in Hutchinson – who left Chelsea on a permanent deal in July – that almost teed up an early opener for Broadhead after a mazy right-sided run. He tested Jorgensen again on three further occasions with fierce strikes, while turning creator for Hutchinson's smart finish after another penetrating carry through the middle. Buoyed by his side's youthful brilliance, McKenna will be hopeful of pushing Ipswich further up the table when visiting high-flying Fulham on Sunday. The Portugal forward then curled straight into the hands of Walton, set up Palmer's attempt that was somehow saved, before being denied by Burns' goalline clearance after Enzo Fernandez created a glorious opening just after half-time.

Delap won and converted a penalty awarded for Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen's lunge in the 12th minute, before setting up Omari Hutchinson to score against his former side early in the second half. Joao Felix saw what would have been a first-half equaliser disallowed for offside after a VAR review, but Enzo Maresca could have little complaints as his profligate side were punished. A monumental victory lifts Ipswich to 18th in the league table, one point and place behind Wolverhampton Wanderers, while Chelsea's third straight winless outing leaves them fourth. How the match unfolded
Tosin Adarabioyo cleared off the line to prevent Nathan Broadhead from opening the scoring after just four minutes – but Chelsea did not heed that early warning. Joao Felix's disallowed back-post finish was created by the brilliance of Cole Palmer, who also rattled the woodwork twice in the opening half – first with a free-kick against a post, before Christian Walton tipped onto the crossbar with an eye-catching stop. Chelsea head coach Maresca worked with Delap at Manchester City's academy and had already pinpointed his threat ahead of the match, suggesting he will become an important player for England in the future. It was another familiar face in Hutchinson – who left Chelsea on a permanent deal in July – that almost teed up an early opener for Broadhead after a mazy right-sided run. At the other end, Walton, who started ahead of Arijanet Muric for just his second league start of the season, commanded his area well and made a string of fine saves – most notably from Palmer in the opening half – to claim what would have been an unexpected clean sheet. Christopher Nkunku fared slightly better coming in for Nicolas Jackson, winning a free-kick centrally that saw Palmer hit Walton's right-hand post – but the Frenchman should have tapped home the follow-up attempt. The Portugal forward then curled straight into the hands of Walton, set up Palmer's attempt that was somehow saved, before being denied by Burns' goalline clearance after Enzo Fernandez created a glorious opening just after half-time. However, for all of Joao Felix's promise, a disappointing showing from Chelsea's defence and a lack of clinical finishing up top saw the Blues miss a chance to go second. Match reports

560,560,aston-villa,2024-12-30,"A late goal from Tariq Lamptey saw Brighton & Hove Albion fight back to earn an entertaining 2-2 draw at Aston Villa on Monday evening. The Seagulls had taken an early lead when Simon Adingra curled a lovely effort into the far corner, only for goals from Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rogers to turn the contest around. Starting in place of the suspended Jhon Duran following his red card against Newcastle United, Watkins converted a penalty following a foul by Joao Pedro on Rogers. Watkins then turned provider for Rogers, who made it 2-1 to Villa early in the second half. Brighton equalised less than 10 minutes from time, however, as Joao Pedro teed up Lamptey to drill a low effort past Emiliano Martinez, denting Villa's UEFA Champions League hopes. Unai Emery's men remain ninth in the Premier League table while Brighton, now without a win in seven matches, stay two points behind them in 10th. Villa failed to deal with a lofted pass from Lewis Dunk, with Joao Pedro drawing in Ezri Konsa and Pau Torres before Adingra took on the loose ball and curled into the far corner. They then went close to doubling their lead as a quick counter saw Julio Enciso's long-range shot pushed around the post by Emiliano Martinez. However, Villa were awarded a penalty when Joao Pedro kicked through Rogers after a corner, with a VAR review leading to the on-field decision to not award a spot-kick being overturned. Watkins kept his cool and converted for 1-1 in the 36th minute. Villa then took the lead early in the second half as a sublime dinked pass by Watkins put Rogers clean through, and he drilled his effort past Bart Verbruggen and into the far corner. Villa stutter despite Watkins boost
Villa’s home form is of considerable importance to their bid to qualify for the Champions League for a second successive season. Watkins, in for the suspended Duran, was a bright spark for Emery's hosts. Watkins played like he had a point to prove after a stint on the bench, showing off his all-round game with nicely weighted pass for the second goal, which was finished off by Rogers. Emery’s men will be hugely disappointed not to see the game out, as they were the superior side for much of the encounter and failed to make a dominant start to the second half count. They started brightly here, looking dangerous in transition through Adingra and Joao Pedro, though they still struggled to deal with periods of Villa dominance either side of the interval. But Hurzeler deserves credit for forcing the issue with a triple substitution early in the second half, and the introductions of Yankuba Minteh and Kaoru Mitoma caused problems for Villa.

But Hurzeler deserves credit for forcing the issue with a triple substitution early in the second half, and the introductions of Yankuba Minteh and Kaoru Mitoma caused problems for Villa. Joao Pedro and Minteh both had chances before Brighton earned themselves an equaliser following some intricate play around the box, which was finished off with a thunderous effort from an unlikely source in Lamptey. Though Brighton's wait for a win continues, Hurzeler will be pleased with the fight shown on a difficult ground, and they remain within touching distance of the European spots ahead of their encounter with Arsenal on Saturday.

562,562,southampton,2025-01-25,"Newcastle United moved back into the Premier League's top four after in-form Alexander Isak made history with two goals in a 3-1 win at struggling Southampton. Isak became the first Newcastle player to score in five consecutive Premier League away games after cancelling out Jan Bednarek's 10th-minute opener with a first-half penalty. Southampton remain bottom of the table, 10 points adrift of Wolverhampton Wanderers in 17th, while Newcastle are a point clear of fifth-place Chelsea, who visit Manchester City later on Saturday. The hosts opened the scoring against the run of play when an unmarked Bednarek headed James Bree's right-wing cross into the top-right corner. Newcastle hit back 16 minutes later though when Isak swept into the bottom-left corner from the spot after being fouled by Joe Aribo. Martin Dubravka had to be alert to turn away Taylor Harwood-Bellis' acrobatic effort early into the second half, and that save proved pivotal minutes later when Anthony Gordon sent Tonali clean through to slide it into the back of the net. Murphy was then denied by the post before Fernandes burst in behind onto McCarthy's long ball and rifled past Dubravka, though a VAR review adjudged Fabian Schar had not touched the ball and found the Southampton midfielder offside. Southampton survived an early wave of pressure before capitalising at the other end through Bednarek's well-placed header, their first goal at home in four league games. Southampton's backline was nowhere to be seen yet again when Isak chested down for Gordon, whose first-time pass sent Tonali racing through before sending McCarthy the wrong way with a disguised finish. Captain Bednarek showed his defensive colleagues how to do it for one moment in the second half, clearing off the line when Joelinton seemed destined to drive into the bottom corner – but the damage was already done by that point. Juric desperately needs improvements at both ends of the pitch if Southampton are to mount an unlikely climb up the table, starting with a huge clash away at Ipswich Town next Saturday. Howe may have been concerned when Bree was afforded far too much room to lift onto the head of Bednarek, given how easily Newcastle were cut open in their 4-1 thrashing by AFC Bournemouth last time out.

564,564,arsenal,2024-12-14,"Arsenal’s Premier League title hopes hit another hurdle as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton’s stubborn rearguard at Emirates Stadium. Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka came closest for the Gunners but were both denied by England's goalkeeper. The draw leaves Arsenal in third position, behind Liverpool and Chelsea, while Everton are 15th. How the match unfolded
Everton had the first big chance of the game, Abdoulaye Doucoure finding space inside the box but seeing his left-foot strike well blocked by Gabriel Magalhaes, though the Gunners swiftly established their dominance, with Gabriel Martinelli and Odegaard going close. Saka saw a shot blocked before teeing up the best opportunity of the half for Odegaard on the half-hour mark, the Norwegian producing a good save from Pickford with his strike, which took a deflection off James Tarkowski. Pickford had one more shot to save before the break, throwing out his left leg to stop Martinelli, and produced arguably his best save of the whole match when denying Saka's volley 59 seconds into the second period. He reacted fast again on the hour mark to kick away a dangerous Saka cross as Everton continued to thwart Mikel Arteta’s team. There was one moment of fleeting excitement for Arsenal fans when VAR took a look at Mykolenko's challenge but no penalty was awarded. Gunners miss opportunity
On another day, any of Arsenal's presentable chances might have flown in and they would be celebrating another home win. Arteta's side did cause Everton problems, particularly via the usual sources of Odegaard and Saka, with the two dovetailing to nice effect in the first half particularly. Arsenal took 13 shots on goal throughout the contest, with Odegaard and Saka responsible for three each. It is also true, however, that the Gunners were nowhere near their best, particularly after Declan Rice and Odegaard were withdrawn on the hour mark in what was a bold call from Arteta. Substitutes Leandro Trossard, Gabriel Jesus and Ethan Nwaneri struggled to make the desired impact and Everton were able to limit the Gunners to little in the final stages. In rudimentary terms, the biggest concern for Arsenal is the number of points they have now dropped. Frustratingly for the Gunners, leaders Liverpool drew at home to Fulham elsewhere on Saturday, meaning they missed a great chance to close the gap on Arne Slot’s side. He commanded his area well as Everton, in the main, nullified Arsenal’s set-piece threat, with Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite excellent. And Pickford’s stop to keep out Saka's volley in the opening minute of the second half was particularly eye-catching. Club reports

565,565,everton,2024-12-14,"Arsenal’s Premier League title hopes hit another hurdle as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton’s stubborn rearguard at Emirates Stadium. Jordan Pickford was in fine form between the sticks for the Toffees, who also defended excellently to frustrate their hosts on Saturday. And other than a late penalty shout for a tackle by Vitalii Mykolenko on Thomas Partey, which was waved away by the referee with the decision upheld by VAR, Everton were able to keep any late drama to a minimum. The draw leaves Arsenal in third position, behind Liverpool and Chelsea, while Everton are 15th. How the match unfolded
Everton had the first big chance of the game, Abdoulaye Doucoure finding space inside the box but seeing his left-foot strike well blocked by Gabriel Magalhaes, though the Gunners swiftly established their dominance, with Gabriel Martinelli and Odegaard going close. Saka saw a shot blocked before teeing up the best opportunity of the half for Odegaard on the half-hour mark, the Norwegian producing a good save from Pickford with his strike, which took a deflection off James Tarkowski. Pickford had one more shot to save before the break, throwing out his left leg to stop Martinelli, and produced arguably his best save of the whole match when denying Saka's volley 59 seconds into the second period. He reacted fast again on the hour mark to kick away a dangerous Saka cross as Everton continued to thwart Mikel Arteta’s team. Arteta's side did cause Everton problems, particularly via the usual sources of Odegaard and Saka, with the two dovetailing to nice effect in the first half particularly. Substitutes Leandro Trossard, Gabriel Jesus and Ethan Nwaneri struggled to make the desired impact and Everton were able to limit the Gunners to little in the final stages. Pickford produces his best
Pickford brought up his 300th Premier League appearance in Everton’s win over Wolves earlier this month, and the 30-year-old called on all of that experience to help Sean Dyche’s team come away with what could prove to be a valuable point in their bid to push themselves away from danger. But they were also going to require a flawless performance from their goalkeeper – and Pickford obliged. He commanded his area well as Everton, in the main, nullified Arsenal’s set-piece threat, with Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite excellent. And Pickford’s stop to keep out Saka's volley in the opening minute of the second half was particularly eye-catching. It summed up what was a very different Everton performance from the one they turned in in their last away game, when they were beaten 4-0 by Manchester United. Having kept four clean sheets in their last five league games, Dyche's side can perhaps begin to breathe a little easier. Club reports

However, Joao Gomes received a second yellow card for a studs-up lunge on Jurrien Timber in the second half, denting hopes of a result for the hosts. Fourth-bottom Wolves, meanwhile, are only above Ipswich on goal difference, and could drop into the relegation zone when Leicester City visit Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. How the match unfolded
Despite Arsenal bossing possession, Wolves created the first big chance as Nelson Semedo crossed for Pablo Sarabia, who miscued his volley over. Wolves got a huge boost on the stroke of half-time as Doherty looked to counter from an Arsenal corner, only to be felled by Lewis-Skelly. Moments after being denied by a sprawling David Raya, Matheus Cunha prodded agonisingly wide. But the momentum turned when Gomes jumped into a senseless challenge on Timber high up the pitch, receiving a second booking and giving Arsenal the impetus to press for a winner. Wolves miss golden chance
Going into half-time goalless and with a one-man advantage, Wolves found themselves with a great opportunity to cause an upset and pull three points clear of the danger zone. However, Wolves showed little in attack after Sarabia's early miss, with Cunha again cutting a frustrated figure just days after his body language was criticised by Pereira following a 3-1 defeat at Chelsea. If an expectant Molineux crowd was expecting more in the second half, they were sorely disappointed as Arsenal made much of the running even with 10 men, Havertz missing another good headed chance before Wolves finally created a pair of openings for Cunha.

Arsenal had Myles Lewis-Skelly sent off for a serious foul play for a clumsy challenge on Matt Doherty late in the first half, giving Vitor Pereira's strugglers hope of a much-needed win. They could not hold out as Calafiori was on hand in the 74th minute to give Arsenal a massive victory, keeping them six points behind Liverpool, who beat 18th-placed Ipswich Town on Saturday. How the match unfolded
Despite Arsenal bossing possession, Wolves created the first big chance as Nelson Semedo crossed for Pablo Sarabia, who miscued his volley over. Kai Havertz then missed two big chances, nodding just past the post before seeing another close-range header brilliantly kept out by Jose Sa’s feet. Wolves got a huge boost on the stroke of half-time as Doherty looked to counter from an Arsenal corner, only to be felled by Lewis-Skelly. But the momentum turned when Gomes jumped into a senseless challenge on Timber high up the pitch, receiving a second booking and giving Arsenal the impetus to press for a winner. Pereira's men had managed to keep Arsenal's full complement at bay in the first half, with Emmanuel Agbadou particularly impressive on his home Premier League debut, using his strength and speed to keep Gabriel Martinelli quiet on the Gunners' right flank. If an expectant Molineux crowd was expecting more in the second half, they were sorely disappointed as Arsenal made much of the running even with 10 men, Havertz missing another good headed chance before Wolves finally created a pair of openings for Cunha. But just as the momentum seemed to be with the hosts, Gomes evened things up with his needless lunge on the edge of Arsenal's box. Defenders lead the way for Arsenal
Coming into Saturday's match, Arsenal had scored seven Premier League goals via defenders this season – more than any other team. Mikel Arteta must have been fearing the worst when Lewis-Skelly was sent off, with Arsenal having failed to win any of the previous three matches in which they had received a red card this season. The Gunners battled to draws with Brighton & Hove Albion and Manchester City, but they were beaten at AFC Bournemouth when William Saliba was sent off in October. Arteta also saw his forwards misfire once again, with Havertz missing three excellent headed chances, the best of those drawing a reflex save from Sa midway through the first half. But Arsenal's defenders led the way once again, with Calafiori netting his second Premier League goal at a crucial time. Calafiori's first strike in red helped Arsenal earn a draw at the Etihad Stadium in September, but this one could prove even more important as they kept pace with Liverpool.",Arsenal_2025-01-25,wolverhampton,mikel-arteta,vitor-pereira,1,0,23,2,0,48,1.0,3,9,4,5,10,397,22,20,1,1,3,0,3,3,6,3,3,0,20,4,0,329,27,55,14,0,50,10,50,7,8,22,8,48,14,0,4,0.7386,3,1,9,52,0.74,1,9,2,1,20,433,27,10,2,1,4,0,4,1,4,5,1,0,12,1,0,364,14,52,20,0,50,10,42,14,7,27,7,53,30,0,2,-0.2813,0,1,4
568,568,southampton,2024-12-15,"Tottenham Hotspur got back to winning ways after a rampant first-half performance secured them a 5-0 victory over Southampton at St. Spurs scored five goals in the first half of a Premier League match for the first time, with James Maddison setting the tone by netting inside the first minute, a blow the Saints never recovered from. Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski then added a quickfire double, before Pape Sarr struck in the 25th minute against a struggling Southampton defence. Despite an improved second half, Southampton remain bottom of the Premier League, while Spurs move up to 10th, just five points off the top four. Sarr’s clever footwork then opened up Southampton’s defence for the fourth time as he side-stepped his marker to slot home, with some home fans heading for the exit in response. The visitors took their foot off the gas after the break as Southampton showed some character, but they were denied a late consolation as Mateus Fernandes had strayed into an offside position. Unholy night for Saints
Some of the Southampton faithful had already left their seats by the time Spurs eased into their 4-0 lead, reflecting a nightmare evening that was over having barely begun. As Spurs scored at will, some minds were doubtless even drifting back to October 2019 and February 2021, when the Saints were beaten 9-0 by Leicester City and Manchester United respectively. If they had not already – Maddison scoring the visitors' fifth just before half-time – a goal Russell Martin missed having headed back to the dressing room to prepare a difficult team talk – may well have provoked the same sense of doom that defined those previous beatings. While Martin's side were carved open too easily, they do at least deserve credit for the way heads did not drop during the second period. This match must quickly be eradicated from Southampton minds, but that spirit must be maintained to give them a chance of recovering from it. By the time Sarr had danced through Southampton’s defence, the result was no longer in doubt, and any lingering worries Spurs fans may have had about their recent slump in form were long gone as their dominance was rewarded.

Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski then added a quickfire double, before Pape Sarr struck in the 25th minute against a struggling Southampton defence. Maddison compounded the hosts’ misery by bending in a fifth in the final minute of first-half stoppage time, giving Ange Postecoglou’s team a much-needed boost as they ended a five-match winless run in all competitions. Despite an improved second half, Southampton remain bottom of the Premier League, while Spurs move up to 10th, just five points off the top four. How the match unfolded
Spurs' onslaught began after just 36 seconds when Djed Spence, making his first Premier League start for the club, slid in Maddison to slot home an opener. Maddison played his part in the second too, with his deflected cross setting up Son to crack a left-footed effort underneath Alex McCarthy before Kulusevski tapped in a third two minutes later when the ball ricocheted to him inside the box. Spurs had time for one more goal on the stroke of half-time, Son rolling the ball down the line for Maddison to curl into the top corner from a tight angle. Unholy night for Saints
Some of the Southampton faithful had already left their seats by the time Spurs eased into their 4-0 lead, reflecting a nightmare evening that was over having barely begun.

If they had not already – Maddison scoring the visitors' fifth just before half-time – a goal Russell Martin missed having headed back to the dressing room to prepare a difficult team talk – may well have provoked the same sense of doom that defined those previous beatings. Spurs' sensational start
Spurs' early blitz meant this encounter was all but won inside half an hour as Postecoglou's side tore into their visitors. While Maddison’s strike got the ball rolling, it was the next three goals that broke the back of the match, with Son scoring in his 100th different Premier League match. By the time Sarr had danced through Southampton’s defence, the result was no longer in doubt, and any lingering worries Spurs fans may have had about their recent slump in form were long gone as their dominance was rewarded. That was not the end of the chances, with Son being denied by McCarthy on a couple of occasions before the fifth came just before the half-time whistle. The pressure on Postecoglou’s shoulders may not be gone just yet, but the white half of north London will certainly feel more confident in their ability again, especially ahead of matches against Man Utd (in the EFL Cup) and Liverpool to come this week.

Mikel Arteta’s men did not have it all their own way, with Bryan Mbeumo continuing his fine campaign by netting an 11th league goal of the season to give the Bees a shock 13th-minute lead. But in-form Gabriel Jesus restored parity just before the half-hour mark, heading in from close range after Thomas Partey’s effort was spilled by Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Wednesday’s triumph sees Arsenal leapfrog Nottingham Forest in the table to move six points behind leaders Liverpool, while Brentford - who have now gone four top-flight matches without a win - remain in 12th place. How the match unfolded
Brentford went ahead against the run of play when Mikkel Damsgaard won possession following a poor Martin Odegaard pass and found Mbeumo, who directed his shot inside David Raya’s near post on the Arsenal goalkeeper’s return to his former club. One-way traffic soon ensued after the break, with Arsenal capitalising on Brentford’s defensive hesitance with another set-piece - this time Merino fired home after Flekken failed to deal with a 50th-minute corner. Nathan Collins’ headed clearance found Martinelli, who controlled with his thigh before firing impressively into the bottom corner, with the goal awarded on pitch and confirmed following a VAR review to check whether the Brentford defender had been fouled. Bees stung by their own defensive errors
Having made the Gtech Community Stadium a fortress at the start of the season, Brentford have now lost consecutive home matches, and Thomas Frank’s side will be frustrated with elements of this performance. The Bees were content with allowing Arsenal to dominate the ball early on, instead showing their threat on the break. Lewis-Potter’s cross was pushed away by Raya with Mbeumo lurking behind him, and the Brentford talisman would make his mark in similar fashion soon after. But Frank will be annoyed at the way his side conceded the leveller having failed to clear their lines on multiple occasions, with Sepp van den Berg’s slow reaction to Flekken’s stop ruthlessly punished by Jesus, who netted his sixth goal in four matches in all competitions. More defensive errors followed during Arsenal’s most potent attacking threat, with Flekken flapping at a corner that saw Merino pounce, and despite Martinelli’s finish being a moment of individual quality, the strike came from a poor clearance from Collins. Brentford rarely threatened after Arsenal’s third with Mathias Jensen narrowly missing a flighted ball into the box late on. The Bees could do with a return to winning ways when they face Southampton on Saturday. Despite a stuttering start against their London rivals, the Gunners looked measured in their approach as they looked to break down Brentford’s stern defensive rearguard, with the hosts’ resolve eventually breached through Jesus. It was Nwaneri’s corner that caused confusion in the Brentford box that led to Merino’s goal, before his teasing delivery resulted in Martinelli putting the result beyond doubt. Match reports

Arsenal could have found themselves further behind when Raya almost spilled Keane Lewis-Potter’s effort into the net, but he recovered brilliantly to claw the ball away on the line.

Ahead of kick-off on Wednesday, Arteta said that his side would have to be “like a hammer” in their pursuit of Liverpool, and they hit the nail on the head with their response to falling behind, keeping their title hopes alive this season. Despite a stuttering start against their London rivals, the Gunners looked measured in their approach as they looked to break down Brentford’s stern defensive rearguard, with the hosts’ resolve eventually breached through Jesus. Arteta had made a huge call by naming Ethan Nwaneri in Arsenal's starting line-up for the first time in the Premier League, with the teenager becoming the third-youngest player ever to start a top-flight game for the Gunners after Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott, and he proved his worth. It was Nwaneri’s corner that caused confusion in the Brentford box that led to Merino’s goal, before his teasing delivery resulted in Martinelli putting the result beyond doubt. Jesus could have added more gloss to the scoreline when Raya’s brilliant punt forward picked out Martinelli, who laid the ball on to his compatriot, but he could only prod wide of the mark. Arsenal will be hoping to keep up the pressure on Liverpool when they travel Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday. Match reports

572,572,chelsea,2024-12-15,"Chelsea claimed a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Brentford to record their fifth straight Premier League win and close gap to two points on Liverpool at the top. Nicolas Jackson’s strike proved decisive in Sunday’s west London derby at Stamford Bridge, where Marc Cucurella was sent off after full-time. It was Cucurella who put Chelsea in front in the 43rd minute, heading home at the end of a first half that the Blues had mostly dominated. After squandering a golden chance to double Chelsea’s advantage on the hour, Jackson atoned with a neat finish 10 minutes from time. Bryan Mbeumo dragged Brentford – who had earlier hit the crossbar – back into it in the final minute of normal time, but it was too little too late for the 11th-placed Bees, while Chelsea are now just two points behind Liverpool, who do have a match in hand. How the match unfolded
Jackson went close twice early on, first glancing wide from Malo Gusto’s cross before stinging the palms of Mark Flekken with a rasping drive. Flekken stood firm again to thwart Enzo Fernandez, this time stretching out a foot to keep out the Argentinian’s shot, before he denied Noni Madueke as the winger surged through on goal. Jackson skied an effort over after great work from Jadon Sancho on the hour mark, and Chelsea would have paid for that miss if not for Robert Sanchez – who kept out Christian Norgaard’s hooked volley – and the crossbar, which Fabio Carvalho struck from close range before Kevin Schade put the rebound over. Jackson made amends when he steered beyond Flekken to grab an insurance goal Chelsea ultimately required. Maresca’s men the main challengers?
With Arsenal dropping points at home to Everton and Manchester City losing to Manchester United, Chelsea were the only one of the teams most likely to mount a title challenge that managed to win this weekend. Despite head coach Enzo Maresca insisting that his side are not in the title race, a fifth straight league win, and one that came about in hard-fought fashion, will do little to temper the expectations of excitable Chelsea fans. Chelsea dominated large parts of the match but ended up holding on for the win after wasting numerous openings to make it far more comfortable, but there were plenty of positives to take. Sancho also continued his fine recent run of form, dovetailing nicely with Cole Palmer in central areas while also setting up that gilt-edged chance that Jackson wasted at 1-0. The Blues now host Shamrock Rovers in midweek in the Conference League before taking on Everton at Goodison Park next weekend. Away day blues continue for the Bees
Though their home form rivals the best in the Premier League, Thomas Frank’s Brentford continue to struggle on the road and this defeat now leaves them with just one point from their eight away matches in the top flight this season. Jackson’s goal just three minutes after that miss could have seen their heads drop completely, but the Bees kept buzzing, with Mbeumo’s late goal making sure that Chelsea were forced to hold on for a nervy victory.

Flekken stood firm again to thwart Enzo Fernandez, this time stretching out a foot to keep out the Argentinian’s shot, before he denied Noni Madueke as the winger surged through on goal. Brentford’s resistance was broken two minutes before the interval, however, as Cucurella headed home from a fine Madueke centre. Jackson made amends when he steered beyond Flekken to grab an insurance goal Chelsea ultimately required. Mbeumo made matters interesting as he finished coolly after bursting through – with Cucurella picking up his second booking after the final whistle was blown. Away day blues continue for the Bees
Though their home form rivals the best in the Premier League, Thomas Frank’s Brentford continue to struggle on the road and this defeat now leaves them with just one point from their eight away matches in the top flight this season. They were distinctly second-best during the first 60 minutes of this match as they struggled to find the attacking outlets of Mbeumo or Yoane Wissa, only really going close the when Mikkel Damsgaard looked set to sweep home, but Levi Colwill denied him with a fabulous block. Frank’s substitutions had a positive impact, though, and they offered far more of a threat going forward. Jackson’s goal just three minutes after that miss could have seen their heads drop completely, but the Bees kept buzzing, with Mbeumo’s late goal making sure that Chelsea were forced to hold on for a nervy victory. Brentford go up against Newcastle United in the EFL Cup quarter-finals next, before they host in-form Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Club reports

Noni Madueke punished a glaring error from City debutant Abdukodir Khusanov early on as Chelsea looked to move five points clear of the champions for UEFA Champions League qualification. However, City began to exert control towards the end of an action-packed first half, and Josko Gvardiol's fifth league goal of the season dragged them level. In the second half, Haaland latched on to Ederson's long ball and lobbed an out-of-position Robert Sanchez to put City ahead, then Foden raced clear to make the points safe in the 87th minute. The victory takes City up to fourth in the table on 41 points, ahead of fifth-placed Newcastle United on goal difference and one clear of Chelsea and AFC Bournemouth. Khusanov recovered to deny Jadon Sancho with a vital block, then Foden fired against a post as City grew into the contest. Sanchez made a smart save to keep out Haaland early in the second half, but the Norwegian would not be denied in the 68th minute. Chelsea's offside trap was sprung again as City added a late third, with Foden taking in Haaland's pass before cruising clear and slotting home. Khusanov’s wobble not costly for City
City have been uncharacteristically busy in the January transfer window, with a rebuild under way following an unconvincing first half of the season. The signings of young defenders Khusanov and Vitor Reis were clearly made with the long-term future in mind, but the former was thrown in at the deep end here, with Ruben Dias and Nathan Ake out and John Stones only making the bench. It was little surprise when he was withdrawn for Stones after 54 minutes, though another new arrival – Marmoush – enjoyed a more positive debut, showing some nice touches and linking well with Haaland. In the end, however, it was a route-one approach that paid off for City, with Ederson's long ball into the right channel earning him an assist for Haaland's goal. While City were far from flawless at the back, they proved they can still beat teams in a variety of ways. Maresca schooled by former colleague
Enzo Maresca served as Pep Guardiola's assistant coach during City's most successful season, aiding their treble in 2022/23. The Italian was making his first return to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, having whipped up plenty of optimism around Chelsea by instilling a proactive approach in and out of possession. But Guardiola had clearly done his homework, and City exploited Chelsea's high line as they earned a morale-boosting victory. City went direct for both of their goals after the break, with battering ram Haaland winning tussles with Chelsea centre-backs in the build-up to both. Club reports

Just three minutes in, Khusanov was at fault for a Chelsea goal as his attempted header back to Ederson was intercepted by Nicolas Jackson, who squared for Madueke to tap home. Chelsea's offside trap was sprung again as City added a late third, with Foden taking in Haaland's pass before cruising clear and slotting home.

Within two minutes of that latter miss, the Chelsea defence's failure to step up in time with his team-mates allowed Nunes to beat the offside trap, and Gvardiol was on hand to convert when the Portugal international saw his shot parried.

Just as he did in a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture in August, Joao Pedro, who won the spot-kick after being caught by William Saliba, netted in the second half to deny the Gunners all three points at the Amex Stadium. Brighton pushed for a late winner, but Arsenal dug in deep to at least ensure their unbeaten streak in the league stretched to 10 matches. Arsenal sit five points behind Liverpool in second, while Brighton, who are without a league win since November 23, are in 10th. Brighton responded well to going behind, with Simon Adingra curling wide, but the hosts struggled to test David Raya. That changed around the hour mark, when Saliba caught Joao Pedro as he attempted a headed clearance. Referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot, and Brighton’s forward duly sent Raya the wrong way. Yankuba Minteh could have won it late on for Brighton after a driving run down the right, but his low shot flashed across the face of goal, with Kaoru Mitoma unable to get a decisive touch. Another draw on the board
Brighton had been looking to end a run of three Premier League draws in a row, and after falling behind so early on, another draw may not seem a bad result. The Seagulls are now without a win in eight matches though, and given the positions they got into against Arsenal, Fabian Hurzeler may feel they should have come away with three points. The half-time introductions of Georginio Rutter and Minteh helped to make a difference, spurring Joao Pedro on after a quiet first half. Brighton’s hopes of European football next season may look slim after their recent run, but Hurzeler will take heart from this performance and aim to get back to winning ways when they return to Premier League action against Ipswich Town on January 16. Absences tell for Arsenal
Many of the pre-match questions continued to focus on how Arsenal would continue to cope without the influential Bukayo Saka, but he was not the only absentee, as Kai Havertz, who has scored in each of his last four league appearances against Brighton, also not involved. While Brighton were able to get their centre-forward more involved as the game wore on, however, Jesus’ influence faded. Thomas Partey did not look particularly comfortable in the role, and Brighton tried to exploit that. Club reports

The Seagulls are now without a win in eight matches though, and given the positions they got into against Arsenal, Fabian Hurzeler may feel they should have come away with three points.

Many of the pre-match questions continued to focus on how Arsenal would continue to cope without the influential Bukayo Saka, but he was not the only absentee, as Kai Havertz, who has scored in each of his last four league appearances against Brighton, also not involved. Eyebrows were raised further as Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli were left on the bench by Mikel Arteta, but Nwaneri, with England boss Thomas Tuchel watching on from the stands, repaid his manager’s faith, scoring his second Premier League goal with an excellent driving run and clean finish on what was just his second start in the competition. Yet Arsenal were never quite in control despite long spells of possession, though Jesus did show a threat when the ball came to him in the box. It was Arsenal’s defensive frailties that showed after that, with no recognised right-back in the squad due to Jurrien Timber’s suspension. Uncharacteristic sloppiness crept in during the second half, with Saliba’s challenge for the penalty before slack defending allowed Minteh to ghost in behind and almost snatch – or set up – a winner. Arteta will be keen to stamp those errors out of their game, with rivals Tottenham next up in the league after an EFL Cup meeting with Newcastle United and FA Cup tie against Manchester United.

578,578,manchester-city,2024-12-15,"Amad inspired a remarkable late turnaround as Manchester United came from behind to seal a dramatic 2-1 derby victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Out-of-form City looked set to move within six points of Premier League leaders Liverpool after Josko Gvardiol's header put them in the ascendency in the first half. However, Pep Guardiola's side were far from their best throughout Sunday's contest and were hit with two late sucker punches, with Amad playing a central role in both goals. Man Utd climbed to 12th after snapping a two-game losing run and are now just five points adrift of City, who remain fifth, nine points off the top. How the match unfolded
Phil Foden flashed a volley past the right-hand post as City dominated possession in the early exchanges without carving out clear-cut chances. Kevin De Bruyne played a one-two with Ilkay Gundogan from a corner, with the Belgian’s subsequent cross looping up off Amad and to Gvardiol, who powered his header into the left-hand corner. But City did not kick on in the second half and failed to heed two huge warnings. City were masters of their own downfall when United finally levelled – Nunes played a back pass directly to Amad then promptly fouled the winger inside the area, allowing Fernandes to drill home from the spot. More misery for makeshift Man City
Yet again, Guardiola was left stunned on the sidelines as City failed to win for the sixth time in seven Premier League matches. Since suffering the blow of losing Rodri to a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury, Guardiola and City have spent plenty of time searching for a way to take charge in midfield and cut down on chances conceded on the counter-attack. Injuries to Nathan Ake, Manuel Akanji and John Stones – who was back among the substitutes for this one – have not helped City's cause, and for this derby, Guardiola picked a starting XI featuring just three recognised defenders, with Nunes filling in at left-back. Given the makeshift nature of City's side, it was perhaps no surprise that they took their time to get going. Foden's miscued effort in the 21st minute was the first shot registered by either team in the match – the longest wait on record for a shot in a Premier League Manchester derby. The nervousness around the Etihad seemed to spread to those donning sky blue, and it was a glaring individual error from Nunes – followed by his desperate attempt to atone – that saw their lead evaporate. Shellshocked by Fernandes' equaliser, City were all over the place when Martinez launched a simple long ball down the middle, with Amad the benefactor, though he still had plenty of work to do. Having looked set to move back into the top four, City now have to regroup for a crucial matchup with Aston Villa next Saturday. The Red Devils got a huge slice of fortune when Nunes' moment of madness allowed them to equalise, but the character they showed to go on and snatch a winner will certainly please Amorim, who of course beat City with Sporting in the UEFA Champions League last month.

The 22-year-old drew a rash tackle from Matheus Nunes to win a penalty that Bruno Fernandes converted in the 88th minute, before scoring himself from a tight angle with stoppage time looming to hand Ruben Amorim a memorable win. Man Utd climbed to 12th after snapping a two-game losing run and are now just five points adrift of City, who remain fifth, nine points off the top.

City were masters of their own downfall when United finally levelled – Nunes played a back pass directly to Amad then promptly fouled the winger inside the area, allowing Fernandes to drill home from the spot. And the United fans were in derby dreamland two minutes later as a long ball over the top from Lisandro Martinez set Amad away. Shellshocked by Fernandes' equaliser, City were all over the place when Martinez launched a simple long ball down the middle, with Amad the benefactor, though he still had plenty of work to do. Statement victory for Amorim
For 88 minutes, it looked like being a frustrating day for Amorim and United, who were staring at a third successive Premier League defeat before launching their late comeback. Before kick-off, Amorim was forced to explain the surprise omissions of Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, both of whom were left out of the United squad entirely in decisions the Red Devils boss described as ""simple selection"". Amad and Fernandes both went close to levelling, while a Ruben Dias challenge on Hojlund was deemed not to be worthy of a penalty by the referee, with the VAR confirming that decision. Amorim's United may still be a work in progress, but results like this one will certainly serve to get fans onside. Match reports

There were encouraging signs for Juric in his first two matches as Southampton boss, as they performed well at times against West Ham despite ending on the losing side. This, however, was a different story and a major step back for the new manager, as Saints were well below-par, going behind early and struggling to assert themselves throughout.

Kevin Schade gave the Bees an early lead with a confident finish after combining nicely with Mikkel Damsgaard. That did not deter Thomas Frank’s side though and they doubled their advantage soon after with a brilliant finish by Bryan Mbeumo, before he netted a well-taken penalty. Keane Lewis-Potter and Yoane Wissa then wrapped things up with goals in stoppage time. Ivan Juric remains without a win as Southampton boss with the club bottom of the table, 10 points from safety, while Brentford move up to 10th. How the match unfolded
The Bees took the lead in the sixth minute as Schade finished coolly past Aaron Ramsdale after being played through by a superb pass from Damsgaard. The second half continued in a similar vein and Brentford thought they had a second after Van den Berg headed home from a corner, but referee Stuart Attwell disallowed the goal following a VAR review after a foul by Wissa on Jan Bednarek. Despite this setback, they were still handed another glorious chance to end the match as a contest, with a Schade flick sending Wissa clean through but he blazed his shot over the crossbar. Saints continued to be open at the back, with Wissa then supplying Mbeumo who made no mistake, thumping his shot into the roof of the net. Lewis-Potter and Wissa added further gloss to the scoreline with fine finishes in injury time. Brentford completely controlled both halves, with the home side second to loose balls and unable to create any opportunities of note. Southampton were ultimately lucky to still be in the contest for as long as they were given Brentford’s wastefulness in front of goal during the early part of the match. Bees finally off the mark on the road
Frank’s side were fully deserving of their first away win of the campaign and will hope this can provide a springboard to more consistent results on the road in 2025. The chances kept coming in the second half but it took some time to earn the second goal, with Wissa guilty of squandering a good chance when put clean through. But he deserves credit for unselfishly squaring to Mbeumo when put in a similarly-dangerous attacking situation just moments later, eventually getting his goal in injury time. Brentford now turn to FA Cup action, with a home tie against Plymouth Argyle next week. Club reports

582,582,brighton-and-hove-albion,2024-12-15,"Ismaila Sarr scored twice as Crystal Palace moved four points clear of the Premier League relegation zone following a 3-1 victory over rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. Brighton, who were often thwarted by the excellent Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson, controlled large periods after the interval, but Sarr’s second goal eight minutes from time condemned Fabian Hurzeler’s side to their first home defeat of the season. An unfortunate 87th-minute own goal from Marc Guehi provided a consolation for Brighton, who are ninth, while Palace move up to 15th. How the match unfolded
After Henderson denied Kaoru Mitoma early on, the visitors made their goalkeeper’s good work count in the 27th minute. Brighton looked rejuvenated after the break, yet could not find a way beyond Henderson, and Palace did the damage on the counter in the 82nd minute when Sarr raced clear and slotted beyond Bart Verbruggen. Henderson’s clean sheet was spoilt when Maxence Lacroix’s attempted clearance bounced in off his defensive partner Guehi, but it was too little too late for Brighton, who were fortunate that Eddie Nketiah subsequently squandered a chance to restore Palace’s three-goal cushion. Seagulls’ wings clipped?
Brighton had a fantastic start under Hurzeler, but they have found matters altogether more difficult in recent weeks, and Sunday’s contest proved to be a continuation of that form. Having succumbed to a late comeback in their 2-2 draw at Leicester City last week, Brighton were searching for a response against their rivals, yet instead they ended the game having surrendered their unbeaten run at home in the league this season. They started brightly, with Mitoma going close, but with Henderson in inspired form for Palace between the posts, the Seagulls were opened up defensively at the other end. As like against Leicester, Brighton conceded twice in quick succession. It took smart saves from Henderson to keep out a thumping Lewis Dunk header and Enciso’s curling attempt to prevent them from halving the deficit. A trip to West Ham United comes next for the Seagulls, who will be aiming to get their season firmly back on track after this bump in the road. Jordan Pickford was in excellent form for Everton at Arsenal on Saturday and his England team-mate Henderson put on another fine goalkeeping display, with his saves from Dunk and Enciso particular highlights.

583,583,crystal-palace,2024-12-15,"Ismaila Sarr scored twice as Crystal Palace moved four points clear of the Premier League relegation zone following a 3-1 victory over rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. Sarr netted in each half while Trevoh Chalobah was also on target for Oliver Glasner’s side, who made it back-to-back wins on the road and are now unbeaten in five games. Palace struck twice in the space of six first-half minutes, with Chalobah breaking the deadlock in scrappy fashion before Sarr’s header doubled the Eagles’ advantage. Brighton, who were often thwarted by the excellent Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson, controlled large periods after the interval, but Sarr’s second goal eight minutes from time condemned Fabian Hurzeler’s side to their first home defeat of the season. An unfortunate 87th-minute own goal from Marc Guehi provided a consolation for Brighton, who are ninth, while Palace move up to 15th. Palace were 2-0 up soon after as Sarr turned from provider to scorer as he headed in Tyrick Mitchell's deep cross to the back post. Brighton looked rejuvenated after the break, yet could not find a way beyond Henderson, and Palace did the damage on the counter in the 82nd minute when Sarr raced clear and slotted beyond Bart Verbruggen. Henderson’s clean sheet was spoilt when Maxence Lacroix’s attempted clearance bounced in off his defensive partner Guehi, but it was too little too late for Brighton, who were fortunate that Eddie Nketiah subsequently squandered a chance to restore Palace’s three-goal cushion. They started brightly, with Mitoma going close, but with Henderson in inspired form for Palace between the posts, the Seagulls were opened up defensively at the other end. Their failure to deal with the set-piece for Palace’s opener was followed up by Tariq Lamptey getting caught underneath the ball in the build-up to Sarr heading in just six minutes later. Yet they couldn’t find the breakthrough, and eventually Palace’s pace on the counter-attack punished them. Glasner’s Eagles click into gear
Unbeaten in four games heading into the match, Palace knew this was a decent opportunity to put distance between themselves and the relegation zone, and they took it with both hands. To go with their solid defending, Glasner will have been thrilled to see the pace and creativity with which his side attacked, with former Watford forward Sarr turning in a brilliant performance, with the only blip being that slice of bad luck for Guehi’s own goal, and Nketiah’s failure to convert when one-on-one with Verbruggen. Palace now have two games against Arsenal to come. Club reports

584,584,everton,2025-01-19,"Manager David Moyes oversaw the first victory of his second Everton spell, as the Toffees held on for a 3-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Goodison Park. Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Iliman Ndiaye were on target for the hosts, who ended a six-match winless streak in the Premier League. Moyes’ side struck twice inside the opening 30 minutes, with Calvert-Lewin netting his first goal in 16 league games before Ndiaye’s fine individual effort doubled their lead. An Archie Gray own-goal made it 3-0 before the break, but Dejan Kulusevski and Richarlison netted late on to ensure a nervy finish for Everton, who held on for victory. The Toffees remain in 16th place but move four points clear of the relegation zone – the same margin that now separates them from 15th-place Spurs, who are without a win in six league outings. How the match unfolded
Everton struck first in the 13th minute as Idrissa Gueye found Calvert-Lewin, who neatly jinked away from three Spurs challenges before slotting past goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky. The Toffees continued to be positive and after Orel Mangala saw a curling effort tipped against a post, the hosts doubled their lead in the 30th minute. Calvert-Lewin could not quite apply the finishing touch after James Tarkowski helped Jesper Lindstrom’s deep ball into the six-yard box, but Gray did, as he turned into his own net. Despite the introduction of former Everton forward Richarlison at half-time, it was not until the 77th minute that Spurs reduced their arrears as Kulusevski neatly lofted into an empty net. Everton deliver Moyes’ first win of second spell
Coincidentally, Everton’s last home Premier League victory against Spurs came during the final season of Moyes’ first spell in 2012/13, and it proved a good omen. Calvert-Lewin’s dry spell was epitomised when he missed a late chance to equalise against Villa in midweek. Ndiaye’s moment of individual quality doubled the advantage and when Gray put through his own net, Everton led a Premier League game at half-time by three goals for the first time in nearly eight years. The visitors responded well to Calvert-Lewin’s opener. It took a well-timed Tarkowski sliding challenge to deny Son Heung-min, who also shot straight at Jordan Pickford soon after. Club reports

Everton struck first in the 13th minute as Idrissa Gueye found Calvert-Lewin, who neatly jinked away from three Spurs challenges before slotting past goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky. A one-two with Gueye released Ndiaye, who drove at the Spurs defence, beat Radu Dragusin and fired into the roof of the net. Despite the introduction of former Everton forward Richarlison at half-time, it was not until the 77th minute that Spurs reduced their arrears as Kulusevski neatly lofted into an empty net. Richarlison then turned in Mikey Moore’s cross following a well-worked short corner in added time to set up a grandstand finish, but it was too late to deny the hosts a morale-boosting win. Everton deliver Moyes’ first win of second spell
Coincidentally, Everton’s last home Premier League victory against Spurs came during the final season of Moyes’ first spell in 2012/13, and it proved a good omen. Although they were given a scare towards the end, the hosts generally maintained their discipline to see out a victory that Moyes will hope proves to be the turning point in their season, which continues away at Brighton & Hove Albion next Saturday. Spurs’ struggles continue
Without a win in five league games, Spurs’ hopes of ending that streak were dented when Dominic Solanke was ruled out not long before kick-off, adding to their extensive injury woes. Spurs now have 10 senior players out injured. It took a well-timed Tarkowski sliding challenge to deny Son Heung-min, who also shot straight at Jordan Pickford soon after. Spurs struggled to generate a decent attacking threat for most of the second half, with their first attempt of the period not coming until the 73rd minute when James Maddison shot high and wide. Kulusevski – perhaps their best player of the match – offered a glimmer of hope, and Richarlison’s brave finish suddenly gave them a chance of snatching a dramatic point. But it was too little, too late for Postecoglou’s side, whose desperate need for a league win continues when they host struggling Leicester City next Sunday. Club reports

586,586,manchester-united,2025-01-19,"Brighton & Hove Albion became the second team to record three consecutive Premier League away wins at Old Trafford after beating Manchester United 3-1 on Sunday. In Man Utd’s first match since their legendary striker Denis Law passed away on Friday, aged 84, they fell behind early on. Yankuba Minteh put the visitors ahead in the fifth minute, only for Bruno Fernandes to restore parity from the penalty spot soon after following Carlos Baleba’s foul on Joshua Zirkzee. But the Seagulls took control after the break, with Kaoru Mitoma putting them ahead before substitute Georginio Rutter capitalised on a poor mistake by Andre Onana to seal the win. The result moves Brighton up to ninth in the table, while United’s first league defeat of 2025 leaves them 13th on 26 points. How the match unfolded
After tributes were paid to Law, including a wreath of flowers laid by Sir Alex Ferguson and a minute's applause, Brighton started the faster of the two sides, with Joao Pedro threatening Onana’s goal after just three minutes, but they would get the goal their performance merited early on. But the Seagulls relinquished control of the game, as an error from Bart Verbruggen saw Zirkzee hauled down by Baleba in the box, with Fernandes dispatching the spot-kick. However, Brighton would establish an advantage on the hour through Mitoma, who became the highest-scoring Japanese player in Premier League history with his 15th goal in the competition, before Onana spilled Yasin Ayari’s ball into the box, allowing Rutter the opportunity to pounce late on. United back to the drawing board
United have had a good few weeks, holding Liverpool to a draw at Anfield before knocking Arsenal of out of the FA Cup and beating Southampton 3-1 on Thursday. And at the other end, a Onana error undermined any efforts to ramp up the pressure in the final minutes. It is the latest Old Trafford disappointment for Amorim, who has now presided over defeat in four of United’s last five league home matches. United fan and darts world champions Luke Littler was in attendance, but his team didn’t look anything like world-beaters. Match reports

After tributes were paid to Law, including a wreath of flowers laid by Sir Alex Ferguson and a minute's applause, Brighton started the faster of the two sides, with Joao Pedro threatening Onana’s goal after just three minutes, but they would get the goal their performance merited early on. Baleba’s excellent pass was gathered by Mitoma, who squared the ball for Minteh to tap in his third Premier League goal of the season. But the Seagulls relinquished control of the game, as an error from Bart Verbruggen saw Zirkzee hauled down by Baleba in the box, with Fernandes dispatching the spot-kick. Brighton thought they had gone ahead when Pedro tucked the ball home, with the goal awarded on-pitch but overturned after a VAR review, with Jan Paul van Hecke fouling Diogo Dalot. However, Brighton would establish an advantage on the hour through Mitoma, who became the highest-scoring Japanese player in Premier League history with his 15th goal in the competition, before Onana spilled Yasin Ayari’s ball into the box, allowing Rutter the opportunity to pounce late on. Ruben Amorim’s side failed to create enough clear-cut chances to properly challenge Brighton’s second-half lead, taking just six shots, none of which were on target. They find life particularly difficult against Brighton, who became the second team in the league’s history – after Man City, who have done it twice – to win three straight matches at this venue. Seagulls soaring
Brighton may impress because of their array of young, attacking talent – but it is how difficult they are to beat that is standing them in good stead this season and they are currently on a six-match unbeaten run. Baleba was impressive again from the base of midfield, winning eight duels as well as a couple of tackles, while Joel Veltman and Lewis Dunk completed four and three clearances each. Mitoma and Minteh were the stars in attack with a goal and an assist each, while Rutter showed off Brighton’s strength in depth by scoring off the bench. Match reports

588,588,manchester-city,2025-01-04,"Erling Haaland scored twice as Manchester City claimed back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time since October with a rampant 4-1 win over West Ham United at the Etihad Stadium. Haaland netted either side of the break, first heading home from Savinho’s delivery to put City 2-0 up, with the Brazilian having played a key role in the hosts’ opener when his cross was turned inadvertently in by Vladimir Coufal. Savinho also teed up Haaland’s second to make it 3-0 after 55 minutes, before Phil Foden ruthlessly punished a mistake at the back by the Hammers three minutes later. Pep Guardiola’s team remain sixth, two points adrift of the top four, while West Ham are 13th. How the match unfolded
The hosts hit the front after 10 minutes when Savinho – on the back of scoring his first Man City goal in the win over Leicester City last time out – twisted and turned before his cross into the box was deflected beyond Alphonse Areola by the unfortunate Coufal. Savinho continued to cause problems down Man City's left wing and he was involved again for the second goal, brilliantly bypassing Coufal before delivering to the back post for Haaland to nod home. Savinho produced his second assist of the day 10 minutes after half-time, slipping Haaland in behind, with the Norwegian delicately lifting the ball over the onrushing Areola. Man City then capitalised on Mohammed Kudus’s poor pass, which allowed Kevin De Bruyne to put the ball on a plate for Foden to finish. New year, new City?
After a torrid end to 2024, Man City started the new year looking a lot more like the side who claimed a record fourth consecutive Premier League title last season. But ever the perfectionist, Guardiola will be striving for improvements moving forward, with West Ham threatening to score on several occasions in the closing stages. As City began to turn the screw in the first half, Areola was forced to save efforts from Bernardo Silva and Rico Lewis. Haaland then notched his side’s second goal to relieve the pressure before brilliantly dinking in for his double as he scored at home for the first time since 26 October. De Bruyne then marked his 400th appearance for City in all competitions with an assist for Foden, as the hosts netted a fourth goal in a match for the first time since August. Guardiola’s side will be in FA Cup action, at home to Salford City, before their next Premier League fixture, against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.

Julen Lopetegui had been dealt an attacking blow ahead of kick-off with talisman Jarrod Bowen ruled out with a fractured foot. The West Ham captain has been involved in more away goals than any of his team-mates in the top flight this season, and his absence was felt in Manchester. West Ham nevertheless started brightly when Kudus struck the side netting on the break, before the Ghanaian teed up an unmarked Soucek, who fired wide from inside the box. Lucas Paqueta then dragged an effort wide, with the Hammers missing that clinical presence in the final third that Bowen so often provides. Quickfire strikes from Haaland and Foden put the match beyond doubt, and West Ham have now conceded nine goals in their last two top-flight encounters. However, the Hammers continued to push forward, with Paqueta sending a free-kick narrowly over before Soucek's effort was repelled. West Ham will be hoping for a return to winning ways in the FA Cup against Aston Villa, before they host Fulham in the Premier League. Club reports

Elliot Anderson and Callum Hudson-Odoi struck with shots from distance before Chris Wood’s header put Forest in control at the break. Southampton’s much-improved display saw them denied by fine Matz Sels saves before Paul Onuachu set up a nervy finish in stoppage time, but Forest were able to hold on. Forest sit third on goal difference after matching Arsenal on 44 points while bottom side Southampton remain on six points, 10 behind 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers. How the match unfolded
The hosts made a quick start as Morgan Gibbs-White sent Anderson away with a brilliant backheel pass before the 22-year-old planted a low shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards for his first-ever Premier League goal 11 minutes in. Wood’s 14th goal of the season, a well-placed header from an Ola Aina cross, put Forest further ahead just before the break as the hosts raced into a comfortable half-time lead. Sels ensured Forest retained their advantage, though was beaten when Onuachu headed home his first Premier League goal in the first minute of stoppage time as Southampton threatened to rescue an improbable draw, before Aina cleared a Bednarek header off the line to preserve Forest’s three points. Forest cling on for victory
Forest went toe-to-toe with Premier League leaders Liverpool in a pulsating 1-1 draw at the City Ground on Tuesday to underline their lofty ambitions this season. Wood proved unstoppable yet again for Nuno’s side, scoring for the fourth consecutive league fixture, but some wasteful finishing almost cost them dearly here. Ramsdale did well to deny Anthony Elanga from close range in the 55th minute before Bednarek cleared Gibbs-White’s follow-up effort off the line, while Wood also failed to turn home from six yards out after Jota Silva knocked a header across the goal in the 73rd minute. In the end, it was some good defensive work from Murillo, Milenkovic and Aina that ensured a precious win for the hosts. Familiar problems for Saints
After a fighting display against Manchester United at Old Trafford where they conceded three goals in 12 minutes to lose 3-1, Southampton would have expected to build on the positives at the City Ground. Though there were glimpses of their midweek display after the interval here as they ran Forest close every inch of the way, it is still a fifth straight league defeat for Juric since first taking charge of the strugglers in a 1-0 defeat to West Ham United on Boxing Day.

However, the visitors pulled one back through Jan Bednarek on the hour-mark before Nikola Milenkovic’s goal was overturned by VAR after Wood was deemed to have interfered with play from an offside position. Southampton’s much-improved display saw them denied by fine Matz Sels saves before Paul Onuachu set up a nervy finish in stoppage time, but Forest were able to hold on. Forest sit third on goal difference after matching Arsenal on 44 points while bottom side Southampton remain on six points, 10 behind 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers. Bednarek's heavy touch, under pressure from Wood, then allowed Hudson-Odoi to double the lead in the 28th minute as another long-range strike got the better of Ramsdale. Southampton bagged a surprise goal when substitute Lesley Ugochukwu’s shot from distance was flicked up and over Sels by Bednarek before Milenkovic’s header at the other end four minutes later was overturned following a VAR review. Sels ensured Forest retained their advantage, though was beaten when Onuachu headed home his first Premier League goal in the first minute of stoppage time as Southampton threatened to rescue an improbable draw, before Aina cleared a Bednarek header off the line to preserve Forest’s three points. But they made things difficult for themselves against a struggling Southampton at the same venue five days later, despite only making one change to their starting line-up, having to dig deep to hold on for a hard-fought victory. Ramsdale did well to deny Anthony Elanga from close range in the 55th minute before Bednarek cleared Gibbs-White’s follow-up effort off the line, while Wood also failed to turn home from six yards out after Jota Silva knocked a header across the goal in the 73rd minute.

After a fighting display against Manchester United at Old Trafford where they conceded three goals in 12 minutes to lose 3-1, Southampton would have expected to build on the positives at the City Ground. But Saints boss Ivan Juric was seething on the touchline only 11 minutes in, as his defence applied little pressure on Anderson and were punished for it. As has been the case for much of the season, it was another individual error, this time from Bednarek, that led to the home side’s second goal, with less than half an hour played. He now has his work cut out to help his players sustain displays like the one in the second half for longer spells as another of the Premier League's high-flying sides, Newcastle United, visit St Mary's Stadium on Saturday.

Jesus plundered a hat-trick against Palace in a 3-2 victory for the Gunners in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, and the Brazilian was on top form again on Saturday with a brace. The Gunners are now back in third, three points behind leaders Liverpool and one shy of Chelsea, having played at least one game more than both, while Palace remain 15th. Arsenal, who wore black armbands in tribute to their former player George Eastham, who died at the age of 88, are back in third, three points behind leaders Liverpool and one shy of Chelsea, having played at least one game more than both, while Palace remain 15th. Palace were level five minutes later when Sarr drove forward from midfield and bent an exceptional low finish into the bottom-right corner. But Jesus proved Palace’s nemesis again just three minutes later, this time with a sublime first-time finish from Thomas Partey’s layoff at a corner. Raya then had to drag Arsenal’s defence out of trouble when he denied Jean-Philippe Mateta a swift equaliser. The Brazilian struck fear into Palace’s defence in a whirlwind opening 15 minutes, with his second goal a thing of beauty as he curled home from the edge of the area. He made himself big to close down Mateta when Arsenal led 2-1, before producing two brilliant saves to frustrate Sarr after the break. Eagles’ wings clipped
A resurgent Palace came into this London derby on the back of five games unbeaten in the league, while they had pushed Arsenal all the way at Emirates Stadium in the EFL Cup in midweek. That strong form was on show from Oliver Glasner’s team during the first half, when they were arguably the better side in terms of creating clear-cut opportunities. VAR may have been called into action had Mateta put away his one-on-one with Raya just after Jesus had put Arsenal back ahead, but Palace’s centre-forward should have done better regardless, even if the visiting goalkeeper did well. But once Martinelli put Arsenal three goals to the good, Palace struggled to assert themselves again in the match. Eberechi Eze, out with a knock, watched on from the stands, as well as his former team-mates Wilfried Zaha and Michael Olise, and Glasner will want his talisman back to action swiftly, as Palace look to make amends for this result when they head to Bournemouth on Boxing Day.

Jesus plundered a hat-trick against Palace in a 3-2 victory for the Gunners in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, and the Brazilian was on top form again on Saturday with a brace. He opened the scoring in the sixth minute and put Arsenal back ahead after Ismaila Sarr had restored parity, before the striker’s header off the post set up Kai Havertz to make it 3-1 to the Gunners before half-time. Arsenal had to rely on some sharp goalkeeping from David Raya before Gabriel Martinelli made matters even more comfortable, with Declan Rice then arrowing in a wonderful fifth. The Gunners are now back in third, three points behind leaders Liverpool and one shy of Chelsea, having played at least one game more than both, while Palace remain 15th. Arsenal, who wore black armbands in tribute to their former player George Eastham, who died at the age of 88, are back in third, three points behind leaders Liverpool and one shy of Chelsea, having played at least one game more than both, while Palace remain 15th. The joy of their victory was lessened by the sight during the first half of Bukayo Saka limping off to be substituted with an apparent hamstring issue. How the match unfolded
Jesus got the ball rolling in a scintillating start, tucking home from the edge of the six-yard box after Tyrick Mitchell had failed to deal with Saka’s cross. Raya then had to drag Arsenal’s defence out of trouble when he denied Jean-Philippe Mateta a swift equaliser. Jesus had a hand in Arsenal’s third in the 38th minute, as his towering header bounced off the upright for a grateful Havertz to tap in. Sarr was twice denied a second by Raya early in the second half, and Arsenal made their goalkeeper’s work count on the hour. Jesus squandered a great chance for his hat-trick when he shot at Dean Henderson, but Martinelli made no such mistake as he turned home from Rice’s follow-up. Rice himself added further gloss in the 84th minute, stroking home to round off an emphatic return to form and pulling off a celebration reminiscent of NBA star Steph Curry. Having seen Jesus star in midweek, Mikel Arteta – who celebrated five years in charge of Arsenal on Friday – would have been a brave man to leave the striker out. Not that Arsenal had it all their own way, and they must be grateful to their goalkeeper for coming up big when required. After an early wobble when attempting to play it out from the back, which almost resulted in Will Hughes robbing possession in Arsenal’s area, Raya pulled off a string of top-class stops. He made himself big to close down Mateta when Arsenal led 2-1, before producing two brilliant saves to frustrate Sarr after the break. Arteta’s introduction of Rice just before the hour helped the Gunners regain control following those Sarr chances, and it was ultimately a comfortable victory for Arsenal, who put the past draws against Fulham and Everton behind them in style. With Ipswich Town and Brentford to come over the festive period, Arsenal will hope any blip is well and truly over, albeit one worry for Arteta will be the fitness of Saka, after he hobbled off injured midway through the first half.

A resurgent Palace came into this London derby on the back of five games unbeaten in the league, while they had pushed Arsenal all the way at Emirates Stadium in the EFL Cup in midweek. Their high press had already drawn a mistake out of Arsenal before Sarr capitalised on some unsure defending from Gabriel and William Saliba, who stood off as the former Watford and Marseille attacker approached the Gunners’ box and were duly punished by an unerringly accurate finish. VAR may have been called into action had Mateta put away his one-on-one with Raya just after Jesus had put Arsenal back ahead, but Palace’s centre-forward should have done better regardless, even if the visiting goalkeeper did well.

594,594,bournemouth,2024-12-16,"Enes Unal's incredible 90th-minute free-kick earned AFC Bournemouth a point as they salvaged a 1-1 draw against West Ham United at Vitality Stadium on Monday. Bournemouth looked set for a frustrating defeat when Lucas Paqueta’s 87th-minute penalty put the Hammers ahead, the Brazilian converting coolly from the spot when Tyler Adams was ruled to have handled Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s cross following a VAR review. A string of excellent saves from Lukasz Fabianski had earlier kept Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth at bay, but West Ham's resistance was broken in remarkable fashion late on. With stoppage time looming, substitute Unal picked out the top-left corner with a tremendous dead-ball effort from 25 yards out, sparing Bournemouth's blushes. The Cherries move up to sixth in the Premier League table with 25 points, three points off the top four. How the match unfolded
Both sides struck the woodwork in a lively start, Bournemouth doing so in the 13th minute when Antoine Semenyo clipped the base of the post with his driven attempt. There was more drama to come, though, as Unal gave Fabianski no chance with his superb free-kick, extending Bournemouth's unbeaten run to four matches. Bournemouth dig deep
Pressing high and looking to attack directly wherever possible, Iraola's Bournemouth side have earned plenty of plaudits for their ability to master the chaos this campaign. Following three straight Premier League wins over Wolverhampton Wanderers, Tottenham Hotspur and Ipswich Town, the Cherries entered Monday's match knowing a victory would take them level in the standings with champions Manchester City. Bournemouth enjoyed plenty of dangerous moments, particularly when they made a rampant start to the second half as Fabianski's acrobatic stops denied Evanilson and Christie. Meanwhile, Semenyo's early effort that struck the left-hand post was the 12th time Bournemouth have hit the woodwork in the Premier League this season – the most of any team. The Cherries looked set to be left with a sour taste when Paqueta hit them with an 87th-minute sucker punch, but a moment of star quality from Unal got them out of jail. With such quality in reserve, Iraola's men have every opportunity to do something special this season. Club reports

A string of excellent saves from Lukasz Fabianski had earlier kept Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth at bay, but West Ham's resistance was broken in remarkable fashion late on. West Ham, meanwhile, stay 14th with 19 points, seven points clear of the relegation zone. Three minutes later, a rapid West Ham break resulted in Jarrod Bowen curling a shot towards the top-left corner, only for the ball to bounce off the crossbar. Fabianski continued to impress after the break, clawing Evanilson's header away and blocking Ryan Christie's rasping strike, before West Ham scored against the run of play. Paqueta a positive for Lopetegui
Julen Lopetegui's early months in the West Ham dugout have been anything but serene, but last week's 2-1 victory over Wolves eased the pressure on the head coach after a five-match winless run. He was hoping to build some positive momentum on Monday, and though Unal's late intervention denied the Hammers two points, there were plenty of positives for his team to take. Only two Premier League matches this season have contained more first-half efforts without a goal; Everton versus Brentford (19) in November and West Ham against Wolves last week (21). Another major positive will be the contribution made by Paqueta, who was left out of Lopetegui's starting lineup for West Ham's last two matches and caused some concern among fans with a social media post earlier on Monday, in which he said: ""I'm not from here. With Brighton & Hove Albion and Southampton up next, Lopetegui will be desperate for more from his Brazilian playmaker. Club reports

Cole Palmer fired the visitors ahead after 14 minutes at Selhurst Park, converting his 13th league goal of the season after a brilliant run by Jadon Sancho. Mateta had been Palace's chief threat throughout and he ultimately drew his side level when converting from Eberechi Eze's pass eight minutes from time. The draw moves Palace six points clear of the bottom three in 15th place, while Chelsea stay fourth, just one point ahead of in-form Newcastle United, who won 2-1 at Tottenham Hotspur earlier in the day. Jackson and Acheampong then went close, while a brief Palace flurry led to a Mateta effort that was deflected wide. But Mateta had the last word, tapping in Eze's pass after a slick move that also involved Ismaila Sarr to secure a valuable point for Palace. Palace find a way
The Eagles could not find much attacking momentum in the first half, with Eze initially unable to create chances in the way he so often does. Palace were perhaps fortunate to not fall further behind after a few near misses at the other end that kept the deficit at one while they were working their way into the game. While this was not a performance that contained some of the flowing play they so impressively ended last season with, Oliver Glasner will be pleased his side found a way to keep their points tally ticking over. Palace have only lost two of their last 12 league matches and positive results have been secured against the likes of Spurs, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Brighton & Hove Albion and now Chelsea. Matches like this one are unlikely to decide whether Palace are going to be relegated – their next league fixture, away to Leicester City, is a more important one – but the level of performances over recent weeks suggest they should be good enough to avoid a real scrap. And in Mateta, they certainly have a striker much of the league will be envious of. With Wesley Fofana and Benoit Badiashile out of action, Maresca looks likely to turn to Acheampong for further appearances, especially after the teenager acquitted himself well at Selhurst Park, notoriously a tough venue for visiting teams.

Cole Palmer fired the visitors ahead after 14 minutes at Selhurst Park, converting his 13th league goal of the season after a brilliant run by Jadon Sancho. Enzo Maresca's side had plenty of chances to increase their lead and secure a first league victory since 15 December but Nicolas Jackson and Josh Acheampong, among others, were guilty of spurning good opportunities. The draw moves Palace six points clear of the bottom three in 15th place, while Chelsea stay fourth, just one point ahead of in-form Newcastle United, who won 2-1 at Tottenham Hotspur earlier in the day. How the match unfolded
Chelsea dominated the first half, first going close when Sancho volleyed over on three minutes. The winger was heavily involved when the breakthrough did come, collecting a cross-field ball and sliding in Palmer to drive home the opener. Jackson and Acheampong then went close, while a brief Palace flurry led to a Mateta effort that was deflected wide. The Blues looked set to see out an important away win and could have doubled their lead through efforts from Jackson and Enzo Fernandez. However, the hosts improved as the match progressed and they started peppering the Chelsea goal more frequently in the second half. Palace have only lost two of their last 12 league matches and positive results have been secured against the likes of Spurs, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Brighton & Hove Albion and now Chelsea. Future bright for Chelsea despite late frustration
Chelsea's performance summed up what their boss Maresca has always said – they are an exciting work in progress. The Blues have not necessarily done as much wrong as the results in their three matches coming into this one suggested and they also did plenty right here, with some lovely play and almost full control of the contest for the first hour. But Chelsea could not take their chances or see out the win, with Palmer’s goal ending up as their only shot on target. The 18-year-old defender has impressed in UEFA Conference League action for the Blues this season and slotted into the backline seamlessly, taking the most touches of any player on the pitch in the first half and forming part of a solid defensive effort overall. Maresca will be eyeing upcoming home fixtures against AFC Bournemouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers as chances to end Chelsea’s wait for a first victory since 15 December. Club reports

The Cherries climb to sixth place and within a point of Eddie Howe’s side, who remain fourth after missing the chance to leapfrog third-place Nottingham Forest. Newcastle responded well and levelled the contest in the 25th minute when Guimaraes headed home Lewis Hall’s corner. However, the Magpies skipper was robbed of possession by Ryan Christie and Dango Ouattara just before half-time, with the latter feeding Kluivert, who neatly slotted in. However, the goal was ruled out by the referee following a VAR review, with the ball having gone out of play in the build-up. There was still time for Kerkez to add further gloss to the scoreline, with the left-back capping a swift counter with a fine finish across the Newcastle goalkeeper. High-flying Magpies brought down to earth
History beckoned for Newcastle as they looked to record 10 successive victories in all competitions for the first time ever. Not only that, but ex-Cherries boss Howe had never beaten his former employers in the Premier League, so this was always going to be a difficult one for the Magpies. Even the Premier League’s most in-form striker had no answer, with the Cherries’ stubborn defence keeping Alexander Isak quiet for most of the contest. At 2-1 down, Newcastle went close to an equaliser with Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon both seeing fierce volleys blocked. However, the home side were stunned when Kluivert flashed in his third goal, while Kerkez made it a rout afterwards. Nevertheless, Howe will hope his players can bounce straight back next weekend, when they travel to St Mary’s to face bottom side Southampton. Kluivert shines at father’s old patch

Bournemouth made a bright start and were ahead after just six minutes when Antoine Semenyo cut the ball back for Kluivert to sweep past Martin Dubravka. The Cherries thought they had increased their advantage after 61 minutes when Ouattara volleyed in David Brooks’ cross. Nevertheless, Bournemouth did get their third goal in stoppage time as Kluivert flashed a magnificent strike beyond a flat-footed Dubravka.

600,600,brentford,2025-01-18,"Darwin Nunez proved Liverpool's late hero as his stoppage-time double fired the Premier League leaders to a 2-0 victory away at Brentford. Mohamed Salah then went close with just minutes remaining at the Gtech Community Stadium, but substitute Nunez made no mistake with his late brace in the dying stages. The win moved Liverpool seven points clear of second-place Arsenal, who host Aston Villa later on Saturday, while Brentford remain 11th after suffering late heartbreak. How the match unfolded
Brentford almost made a rapid start just five minutes in. The unmarked Mikkel Damsgaard could not make the required contact, however, after Yoane Wissa’s slight deflection on Mads Roerslev's dangerous delivery. Salah went close when his 89th-minute curler from the edge of the D narrowly evaded Mark Flekken's bottom-right corner, though Slot's side would soon be saved by Nunez. Alexander-Arnold's driving run teed up the late first when his pull back from the right found Nunez, who converted from close range – he repeated the dose soon after when combining with Elliott and thumping past Flekken. Battling Brentford undone late on
Brentford rarely looked like a side that had managed just one win across their previous eight matches in all competitions – in fact, Thomas Frank's side shaded the opening stages on Saturday. Bryan Mbeumo was the chief tormentor of Liverpool, forcing an early caution for Kostas Tsimikas just minutes after his inside run freed Roerslev, whose delightful delivery should have ended with Damsgaard tapping home at the back post. Brentford star Mbeumo again had the beating of Tsimikas, twice testing the hands of Alisson in the opening 20 minutes, before the forward's wide free-kick was glanced over by Christian Norgaard. Another Mbeumo free-kick with 20 minutes remaining had Alisson scrambling to parry the cross before the Liverpool goalkeeper denied the Cameroonian's tame strike and a routine header in the closing stages. Yet, for all of Brentford's promise in attack from Mbeumo and Wissa, they were undone late on by Nunez's deadly finishing as the league leaders finally found the quality that has them in control of the title race. Having managed to come back in the closing stages in the midweek draw with Manchester City, a reverse outcome here will leave Frank desperate for a result when his side travel to Crystal Palace in eight days' time. Gakpo headed straight at Flekken early on after an inviting cross from Luis Diaz, who made a mess of his header from Ibrahima Konate's lob shortly after.

601,601,liverpool,2025-01-18,"Darwin Nunez proved Liverpool's late hero as his stoppage-time double fired the Premier League leaders to a 2-0 victory away at Brentford. Arne Slot's side seemed destined to make it three league matches without a win in 2025, having seen Dominik Szoboszlai denied by the woodwork and Cody Gakpo miss a glorious chance in the first half. Mohamed Salah then went close with just minutes remaining at the Gtech Community Stadium, but substitute Nunez made no mistake with his late brace in the dying stages. The Uruguayan striker first converted from Trent Alexander-Arnold's smart cutback pass in the 91st minute, before hammering home from Harvey Elliott's offload just two minutes later. The win moved Liverpool seven points clear of second-place Arsenal, who host Aston Villa later on Saturday, while Brentford remain 11th after suffering late heartbreak. Szoboszlai rattled the crossbar when driving a 20-yard attempt towards the top-left corner, while Gakpo dragged a brilliant opportunity wide from Salah's delightful right-sided offload six minutes before the break. Gakpo turned creator for Salah after the interval, though the Egyptian saw his placed attempt blocked by Keane Lewis-Potter before Nathan Collins headed clear on the line. Salah went close when his 89th-minute curler from the edge of the D narrowly evaded Mark Flekken's bottom-right corner, though Slot's side would soon be saved by Nunez. Alexander-Arnold's driving run teed up the late first when his pull back from the right found Nunez, who converted from close range – he repeated the dose soon after when combining with Elliott and thumping past Flekken. Bryan Mbeumo was the chief tormentor of Liverpool, forcing an early caution for Kostas Tsimikas just minutes after his inside run freed Roerslev, whose delightful delivery should have ended with Damsgaard tapping home at the back post. Another Mbeumo free-kick with 20 minutes remaining had Alisson scrambling to parry the cross before the Liverpool goalkeeper denied the Cameroonian's tame strike and a routine header in the closing stages. Liverpool overcome stuttering start to 2025
Liverpool remain the frontrunners in the title race but Slot may have been scratching his head after another performance lacking the decisive edge for large parts. A rapid counter-attack kick-started by Szoboszlai should have allowed Gakpo to convert Salah's well-timed pass into the box, though the Dutchman wasted a left-footed opening by touching wide of the onrushing Flekken. It looked like a frustrating outing when Nunez headed another chance wide, and Alexander-Arnold fired a late long-ranger off target before Salah's delicate finish just missed the bottom corner after cutting inside. Yet Nunez found his shooting boots, scoring in the league for the first time since November, to get Liverpool out of trouble. Despite their late show, Slot will still be demanding improvements when his side host struggling Ipswich Town next time out in the league at Anfield.",Liverpool_2025-01-18,brentford,arne-slot,thomas-frank,2,0,22,2,0,61,3.43,4,37,7,15,14,484,10,6,3,0,8,1,14,15,28,9,2,0,61,2,0,423,10,53,20,0,43,3,23,12,7,10,4,52,19,0,7,0.6504,0,0,3,39,0.72,2,11,6,2,6,319,12,14,2,0,6,0,4,1,9,2,2,0,24,2,6,252,11,30,26,0,57,9,33,13,8,12,10,48,35,0,6,0.2422,1,1,14

The Wales international climbed off the bench to settle matters at the Vitality Stadium with a neat 77th-minute volley. Despite generating the greater attacking threat, Andoni Iraola’s side had endured a generally frustrating afternoon as they struggled to break down the Toffees, who offered little going the other way. However, Brooks made the decisive impact, guiding home Milos Kerkez’s cross to extend the Cherries’ unbeaten streak to a club-record eight Premier League games. Bournemouth sit seventh but move within three points of fourth-place Chelsea, while Everton stay 16th, just two points clear of the relegation zone. How the match unfolded
The in-form Cherries – who fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 in dramatic fashion in the reverse fixture earlier this season – quickly settled into their rhythm, with Jordan Pickford thwarting Dango Ouattara in the eighth minute. Antoine Semenyo thought he had put Bournemouth in front when he turned in Ryan Christie's cross soon after, but the winger was denied by the offside flag. With the introductions of Nathan Patterson and teenager Harrison Armstrong, Everton looked more dangerous after the break, though it was Bournemouth who seemed the more likely to break the deadlock, with Semenyo testing Pickford from 20 yards. Buoyant Bournemouth
Never before had Bournemouth gone eight successive Premier League games without tasting defeat, but now they have, and Saturday’s win was richly deserved. The Cherries looked confident right from the kick-off, and it took a couple of smart saves from Pickford to keep them at bay. Bournemouth have scored a league-high 10 goals in the final five minutes of Premier League matches this season, but they did not need to wait that long here. It marks just the start to 2025 the Cherries were looking for and, though Chelsea, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool provide their next four Premier League opponents, they will certainly head into those games with their tails up. Another bleak trip south for Everton
Without a win in four league games ahead of this encounter, Everton will not have exactly been relishing the prospect of a trip to the Vitality Stadium – a ground on which they had never previously triumphed in the Premier League. Club reports

With the introductions of Nathan Patterson and teenager Harrison Armstrong, Everton looked more dangerous after the break, though it was Bournemouth who seemed the more likely to break the deadlock, with Semenyo testing Pickford from 20 yards. And the Toffees’ resolve was finally broken when Kerkez sat an inviting cross to the far post and Brooks volleyed home. Abdoulaye Doucoure went close to equalising when he volleyed narrowly wide in the 85th minute, but Everton succumbed to a second straight defeat. The Cherries looked confident right from the kick-off, and it took a couple of smart saves from Pickford to keep them at bay. He coolly did the rest to finally get the breakthrough, with Vitalii Mykolenko in no man’s land in the Everton defence. Another bleak trip south for Everton
Without a win in four league games ahead of this encounter, Everton will not have exactly been relishing the prospect of a trip to the Vitality Stadium – a ground on which they had never previously triumphed in the Premier League. Sean Dyche’s side had Pickford to thank for keeping the scoreline at 0-0 during the first half, and for large periods of the second. The Toffees – who lost striker Armando Broja to injury midway through the first half – certainly looked better from an attacking perspective after the break, yet nevertheless they finished the game without registering a shot on target. Things do not get any easier for Everton either. Indeed, the Toffees could even find themselves in the bottom three by the end of this matchweek, should other results go against them. Club reports

It was that lack of cutting edge that proved costly for Leicester, as Fulham seized their chance after restart when Smith Rowe nodded home Sasa Lukic's flick on. That seemed to knock Leicester's confidence and Ayew wasted a half-chance to equalise, before Traore calmly volleyed home from Harry Wilson's dinked cross. With the chances of a comeback diminishing, Leicester continued to battle away and Jamie Vardy snatched just wide in the closing stages. Vardy did almost grab a late consolation as Leno clawed away his close-range drive, before a delayed offside flag denied the Foxes captain anyway. Vardy fails to carry Foxes
Vardy remains a menace for Premier League defences but the veteran striker's potency could not get them anything here. His sharpness in and around the opposition penalty box means he continues to be Leicester's main attacking threat but Ruud van Nistelrooy will be acutely aware of the need for a Plan B to the 38-year-old. Successive Premier League games without a goal exemplifies just how much Leicester are struggling to drag themselves out of the relegation zone. Van Nistelrooy and Leicester now face successive away games at Tottenham and fellow strugglers Everton, and they need the supporting cast to lighten the load on Vardy. His bravery to dive in and convert Fulham's breakthrough goal at the King Power Stadium showed his tenacity and intelligence.

The hosts carved out the better chances in the opening stages, with Bernd Leno denying Jordan Ayew inside the first 90 seconds.

Fulham, meanwhile, stay ninth in the table, two points adrift of Aston Villa in eighth. Goalkeeper Bernd Leno turned Broadhead's volley wide just after the hour mark, and the hosts were level soon afterwards. Jimenez made no mistake after Sam Morsy trod on Harry Wilson's foot inside the area, with the penalty awarded by the referee after a VAR review. Jimenez on the spot
Fulham will have wondered how they found themselves a goal down at half-time, having dominated possession and played the majority of the first period in front of Ipswich's penalty area without being able to make the decisive breakthrough. They also felt aggrieved to still be playing against 11 men when Davis wiped Wilson out midway through the first period, halting a dangerous Fulham attack. In the end, Fulham may be somewhat relieved that Davis stayed on the pitch, given it was his trailing leg that felled Jimenez inside a crowded penalty area as the match entered seven minutes of stoppage time. Having slotted his first spot-kick into the bottom-left corner, Jimenez went the opposite way with his second, side-footing into the top-right corner to make it eight Premier League matches unbeaten for Marco Silva's side. However, if dreams of European qualification are to become a reality, they must start turning draws into wins. Fulham huffed and puffed throughout the first half but were unable to make their dominance count, with Walton standing firm between the sticks before Szmodics' predatory finish put the visitors ahead. With Fulham's penalty being scored in the 69th minute and Ipswich's in the 71st, it is the shortest gap between two penalty goals in a Premier League match since Opta began recording exact goal times in 2006/07.

Ipswich initially went ahead when Sam Szmodics pounced on a Calvin Bassey error late in the first half, but the rest of the match was a tale of three spot-kicks. Jimenez slotted home the first penalty in the 69th minute, but Ipswich were back ahead just two minutes later, Liam Delap powering home from 12 yards after he was fouled by Timothy Castagne. That put Ipswich on course for their first set of back-to-back Premier League wins this season, but Leif Davis' tired challenge on Jimenez allowed the Mexican to net his second penalty in the first minute of stoppage time. That denied Ipswich the opportunity to escape the relegation zone, and the Tractor Boys remain behind 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers on goal difference. How the match unfolded
Christian Walton denied Jimenez from the first major chance after 20 minutes, and Ipswich then went ahead against the run of play in the 38th minute. Ben Johnson headed Nathan Broadhead's cross against the crossbar, but Bassey then shanked his clearance for Szmodics to smash home.

Visiting a side tipped to challenge for a top-six finish, Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna may have taken a point before kick-off. When Ipswich emerged from a chaotic two-minute spell in the second half 2-1 ahead, it felt like it just might be their day. With Fulham's penalty being scored in the 69th minute and Ipswich's in the 71st, it is the shortest gap between two penalty goals in a Premier League match since Opta began recording exact goal times in 2006/07. But once again, Ipswich could not hold on, with another individual error proving costly when Davis felled Jimenez in a relatively unthreatening position, on the right side of a crowded penalty area with the angle to goal tight. That meant Ipswich failed to back up their memorable midweek win over Chelsea, and they have now dropped 17 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season. Club reports

Cody Gakpo netted a swift equaliser before Matthijs de Ligt's handball allowed Mohamed Salah to put Liverpool ahead from the penalty spot, but the hosts were far from their best and were pegged back late on. The draw lifts Ruben Amorim's side to 13th in the table, leapfrogging West Ham United, while Liverpool are six points clear of second-placed Arsenal with a match in hand. How the match unfolded
Liverpool went close to scoring a brilliant team goal in the 14th minute, but Gakpo flicked wide after great approach play from Ryan Gravenberch, before Andre Onana thwarted Alexis Mac Allister at his near post. Trent Alexander-Arnold's loose ball was cut out by Martinez, who exchanged passes with Bruno Fernandes before firing in off the crossbar. Eleven minutes later, Alexander-Arnold's cross was flicked on by Mac Allister onto the outstretched arm of De Ligt, with Michael Oliver awarding the spot-kick following a pitchside VAR review, allowing Salah to coolly convert. However, Liverpool could not press home their advantage as substitute Alejandro Garnacho raided down the left to tee up Amad, who tucked his low finish beyond Alisson. Liverpool get cold feet
Sunday's match was thrown into doubt when heavy snowfall struck Merseyside and, for much of the contest, it seemed the cold weather might have got to Liverpool's stars. Aside from a two-minute blitz in which they created good opportunities for both Gakpo and Mac Allister, the leaders failed to turn up the heat in the first half. Slot's half-time team talk failed to have the revitalising effect the home fans desired, with Alexander-Arnold – who struggled all match – guilty of a mistake in the build-up to Martinez's opener. Gakpo's quickfire equaliser stirred Liverpool into life and the Anfield crowd were in fine voice when Salah gave them the advantage. However, the Reds' frailties on the right continued to show, and it was no surprise when United's equaliser came via another raid down that side. Alexander-Arnold was withdrawn for Bradley shortly after another dangerous United attack came to nothing, and his struggles summed up what was a frustrating day for Slot's men.

United's lead lasted just seven minutes, though, as Gakpo brilliantly turned De Ligt on the left side of the area before blasting into the top-right corner. However, Liverpool could not press home their advantage as substitute Alejandro Garnacho raided down the left to tee up Amad, who tucked his low finish beyond Alisson. Conor Bradley struck the outside of the post but United had the best chance to win it, Harry Maguire somehow lifting over a gaping goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time.

Alexander-Arnold was withdrawn for Bradley shortly after another dangerous United attack came to nothing, and his struggles summed up what was a frustrating day for Slot's men. Amad the hero again
It is fair to say that Amorim needed a statement result at the end of a week that began with the United boss admitting relegation was a possibility, in comments made after his team were routed 3-0 by Newcastle United at Old Trafford. United could have lost four straight league matches within the same season for the first time since 1979, and could even have done so without scoring for the first time since 1909. While they were undoubtedly aided by Liverpool producing one of their most tepid displays of the season, United showed plenty of fight to reduce the Anfield crowd to groans of frustration, and they had already passed up several good chances before Martinez put them ahead. However, the 22-year-old, who has been the standout player of the Amorim era to date, kept plugging away and provided the moment of the match, peeling away from his marker to sweep Garnacho's cross home in the 80th minute. Things could have been even better for United, had Maguire not shot over the crossbar when teed up by Joshua Zirkzee deep into stoppage time. While Amorim has not enjoyed an ideal start to his United tenure, he can at least point to battling results at both the Etihad Stadium and Anfield as he sets about rebuilding the Premier League's fallen giants.

West Ham remain 14th on 20 points – five fewer than Brighton, who stay ninth after missing the chance to move as high as sixth as their winless run was extended to five matches. How the match unfolded
Jarrod Bowen and Kaoru Mitoma were denied from tight angles early on, with the former's cross deflecting narrowly wide, but that was the closest either side came to opening the scoring in a tepid first 45 minutes. Tomas Soucek released Bowen into space, with the England international’s fierce drive parried straight to Kudus, who made no mistake in nodding home the rebound. Hammers still seeking first Brighton home win
Though they had never beaten Brighton at home in the Premier League, West Ham had every right to feel confident. The Hammers had taken 10 points from their last five league games at the London Stadium. Although Julen Lopetegui brought Niclas Fullkrug in for his first start, the German was generally seeking better service from his team-mates during the opening half. Nevertheless, the hosts did respond swiftly to falling behind through Bowen, who had just adopted a more central position. His driving run forced a smart stop from Bart Verbruggen, but Kudus was on hand to apply the finishing touch. Crysencio Summerville looked lively upon his introduction, seeing a shot blocked late on, but that was as close as the Hammers came to grabbing all three points. Up next for West Ham is a Boxing Day trip to Southampton, who have just appointed Ivan Juric as their new manager. Nevertheless, they kept West Ham at bay during the first half, with their defensive stubbornness highlighted by Jan Paul van Hecke, who sported a bandage around his head after receiving an accidental boot from Konstantinos Mavropanos early on. But Brighton are without a clean sheet in eight league games, so West Ham will have always sensed an opportunity to hit back and did just that through Kudus. Club reports

Brighton, however, would break the deadlock six minutes after the break when Wieffer slotted in a controlled volley after Lewis Dunk had beaten Fabianski to Pervis Estupinan’s cross. The Seagulls squandered several opportunities to regain the lead late on, with Yankuba Minteh’s low cross turned on to the post by Mitoma, before Fabianski saved from Ayari from close range and Aaron Wan-Bissaka producing a remarkable clearance off the line to deny Tariq Lamptey a tap-in. Hammers still seeking first Brighton home win
Though they had never beaten Brighton at home in the Premier League, West Ham had every right to feel confident. Seagulls have their wings clipped
Without a victory in four matches, Brighton will not have been relishing a trip to London, where they had failed to win on any of their 10 previous Premier League visits. The Seagulls took the lead as Wieffer opened his account for the club, though it was a bittersweet day for the midfielder, who limped off injured a few minutes later. But Brighton are without a clean sheet in eight league games, so West Ham will have always sensed an opportunity to hit back and did just that through Kudus. Brighton did, however, look the more likely to snatch all three points late on. Unmarked in the six-yard box to meet Minteh’s low cross, Mitoma somehow skewed his effort against the post from inside the box. Brighton return to the AMEX Stadium to face Brentford next Friday.

The win sees Palace leapfrog West Ham in the league table. How the match unfolded
A good save from West Ham goalkeeper Fabianski after Mateta was played through by Daniel Munoz in the 12th minute was the main opportunity of note before the break. The result was put beyond doubt late on when the West Ham keeper fouled a lively Nketiah inside the box and Mateta squeezed his spot kick below a diving Fabianski to secure back-to-back road wins for Palace. West Ham need more firepower
It’s been a frustrating campaign for West Ham and their supporters, but they were hoping for a new manager bounce under Potter as they bid to rise up the table. The Hammers laboured to a 3-2 win over Fulham in Potter’s first home game in charge in midweek, a result that came despite only registering four total shots. Mohammed Kudus started centrally for West Ham supported by Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but they failed to find a way to trouble the Palace defence. But West Ham ultimately could not register a shot on target in a comfortable afternoon for Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson, which is a worrying sign for the new Hammers boss going into tough away games against Aston Villa and Chelsea.

613,613,crystal-palace,2025-01-18,"Jean-Philippe Mateta scored a second-half double as Crystal Palace continued their impressive recent form with a 2-0 away win over West Ham United on Saturday. After a quiet first half, Mateta – who has now netted in three straight Premier League matches – opened the scoring in the 48th minute as his low strike from outside the box out beat Lukasz Fabianski at the end of a quick break. Mateta then secured a Palace victory from the penalty spot in the 89th minute after Fabianski brought down substitute Eddie Nketiah, ensuring the visitors extended their unbeaten run to five top-flight matches. The win sees Palace leapfrog West Ham in the league table. How the match unfolded
A good save from West Ham goalkeeper Fabianski after Mateta was played through by Daniel Munoz in the 12th minute was the main opportunity of note before the break. The game needed a goal and, unsurprisingly, it came through Mateta. Oliver Glasner’s side turned defence into attack rapidly as Ismaila Sarr nodded down a clearance towards Eberechi Eze, who slipped in Mateta to race forward and slot past Fabianski with a composed finish. Fabianski remained busy in the second half, producing saves from Maxence Lacroix and Nketiah before the visitors found themselves in more trouble when Mavropanos was sent off for a high boot on Mateta. The result was put beyond doubt late on when the West Ham keeper fouled a lively Nketiah inside the box and Mateta squeezed his spot kick below a diving Fabianski to secure back-to-back road wins for Palace. Mateta stars for Palace again
Palace captain Marc Guehi was full of praise for striker Mateta in the build-up to the contest and the Frenchman’s display in east London once again demonstrated his value to Glasner. After a forgettable first half, Mateta broke the deadlock three minutes after the restart after being sent through by a delightful pass from Eze. Mateta had also struck late to rescue a 1-1 draw against Chelsea in Palace’s first game of 2025 before also opening the scoring in their 2-0 defeat of Leicester City on Wednesday. The striker and Eze have been Palace’s standout stars in their five-game unbeaten run in the league, with the England winger now having produced three assists in as many top-flight games. It meant they were looking for their first back-to-back wins of the Premier League season as they welcomed Palace, but with their only fit striker Danny Ings on the bench, Potter’s side hardly threatened in the first half and looked very much like a team in desperate need of shoring up their attack in the transfer window. Mohammed Kudus started centrally for West Ham supported by Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but they failed to find a way to trouble the Palace defence. But West Ham ultimately could not register a shot on target in a comfortable afternoon for Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson, which is a worrying sign for the new Hammers boss going into tough away games against Aston Villa and Chelsea.

Murphy brilliantly assisted Isak for his hat-trick goal early in the second half, when Ipswich were arguably fortunate to avoid further punishment. Ipswich stay 18th, two points adrift of Leicester in 17th. Ipswich then presented Newcastle with an early Christmas gift on the stroke of half-time, as Bruno Guimaraes dispossessed Jens Cajuste inside the hosts' area to leave Isak with a simple finish. Watching the Magpies tear through Ipswich at will, it was remarkable to think they were being criticised for a lack of attacking thrust as recently as late November, when they failed to record a shot on target in a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace just five days after a tame 2-0 loss to West Ham. Isak got them off to a dream start here, sending his volley bouncing off the wet turf and beyond Arijanet Muric before the Ipswich goalkeeper could even blink. Ipswich defended poorly, but Newcastle deserve plenty of credit for the way they ruthlessly exploited the space left by their hosts. Tractor Boys toil on home soil
Kieran McKenna was hoping last week's dramatic 2-1 win over fellow strugglers Wolverhampton Wanderers would serve as a turning point for Ipswich, but their poor form at Portman Road is threatening to undermine their bid to avoid the drop. Ipswich have now drawn four and lost five of their nine Premier League home matches this season. The Tractor Boys did threaten to make it a contest at 1-0 down, with Cajuste lashing over from the edge of the box before Sammie Szmodics snuck in behind a napping Newcastle backline, only to be denied by stand-in goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. While Newcastle's quality told for their second and fourth goals, their third will have disappointed McKenna. With just three minutes of first-half stoppage time to navigate, Muric was far too casual in attempting to play out to Cajuste and Ipswich were punished. Between now and the start of February, Ipswich face Arsenal, Chelsea, Fulham, Brighton, Manchester City and Liverpool. Club reports

Eddie Howe's side, who also beat Leicester City 4-0 last week before making the League Cup semi-final on Wednesday, led inside 25 seconds courtesy of Isak's volley. Jacob Murphy, whose run had helped tee up the opener, powered in a second shortly after the half-hour mark, then Isak punished some sloppy play from Ipswich to make it 3-0 before the break. Murphy brilliantly assisted Isak for his hat-trick goal early in the second half, when Ipswich were arguably fortunate to avoid further punishment. The convincing win takes Newcastle seventh in the Premier League table, just four points off the top four ahead of Arsenal's trip to Crystal Palace. How the match unfolded
Newcastle had the ball in the net almost instantly, Isak lashing home after Murphy's cross was half-cleared. Anthony Gordon and Isak went close before the rampant visitors doubled their lead in the 32nd minute, with Murphy rattling a ferocious finish off the crossbar. Ipswich then presented Newcastle with an early Christmas gift on the stroke of half-time, as Bruno Guimaraes dispossessed Jens Cajuste inside the hosts' area to leave Isak with a simple finish. Gordon sent a sliding effort over an open goal right before half-time and Newcastle's relentless pressure continued after the break, Guimaraes hitting the post with a diving header. Newcastle's main men combined for their fourth goal in the 54th minute, Murphy producing one of the assists of the season when his backheel found Isak for a prodded finish. Magpies soaring after big win
Newcastle have been up and down for much of 2024/25, but two 4-0 triumphs in the space of seven days suggests they have finally found their feet. Watching the Magpies tear through Ipswich at will, it was remarkable to think they were being criticised for a lack of attacking thrust as recently as late November, when they failed to record a shot on target in a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace just five days after a tame 2-0 loss to West Ham. Isak got them off to a dream start here, sending his volley bouncing off the wet turf and beyond Arijanet Muric before the Ipswich goalkeeper could even blink. It was Newcastle's earliest-ever away goal in the Premier League, and their fastest overall since Miguel Almiron netted after 20 seconds against West Bromwich Albion in December 2020. Going on to claim the match ball, Isak has now hit double figures for Premier League goals this season, contributing eight involvements in his last four matches (six goals, two assists). Ipswich defended poorly, but Newcastle deserve plenty of credit for the way they ruthlessly exploited the space left by their hosts. If not for some lacklustre finishing from Gordon and Willock, the scoreline could have been even more convincing. All of a sudden, Newcastle's frontline appears littered with goals, with their improvement coming at the perfect time as they gear up for festive clashes with fellow European hopefuls Aston Villa, Manchester United and Tottenham. The Tractor Boys did threaten to make it a contest at 1-0 down, with Cajuste lashing over from the edge of the box before Sammie Szmodics snuck in behind a napping Newcastle backline, only to be denied by stand-in goalkeeper Martin Dubravka.

It could have been a different story for Wolves if the excellent Matz Sels had not denied Jorgen Strand Larsen, who also saw an effort cleared off the line by Murillo, with the scoreline at 1-0. Vitor Pereira was left to rue those failed attempts as he suffered a first defeat as Wolves head coach - his team remain 17th, clear of Ipswich Town on goal difference. Strand Larsen somehow fired straight at Murillo with a near-open goal gaping soon after, before Sels parried the Wolves forward’s header. Forest had their goalkeeper to thank again soon after, as he kept out a thumping volley from Rodrigo Gomes. The inspired Sels once again frustrated Wolves after tipping away Strand Larsen's driven effort following fine link-up play with Goncalo Guedes in the second half. Problems to ponder for Pereira
Pereira's unbeaten start to life at Molineux came to an end as this defeat provided a timely reminder of issues that have left Wolves struggling. That gilt-edged chance came shortly after Wolves were cut open far too easily, with Gibbs-White afforded the freedom of his former stomping ground to burst away and exchange with Elanga to score. Strand Larsen rushed another equalising opportunity from debutant Pedro Lima's right-sided cross before somehow seeing his close-range header parried away by Sels after Gomes' delivery from the opposite flank. Pereira, who was missing suspended talisman Matheus Cunha, may have looked at Forest poacher Wood with envy after seeing his striker Strand Larsen pass up another chance in the second half, blasting a right-footed effort just within Sels' stretching reach. Wolves will hope to bounce back against Bristol City in the FA Cup third-round on Saturday, although Pereira will have much to ponder before visiting in-form Newcastle United in the league four days later.

617,617,nottingham-forest,2025-01-06,"Nottingham Forest claimed a SIXTH straight Premier League victory as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at Molineux. Nuno Espirito Santo's third-placed side moved level on points with Arsenal and just six shy of leaders Liverpool - who they host next time out in the league - after another clinical performance. Morgan Gibbs-White opened the scoring just seven minutes into Monday's match against his former side, before Chris Wood doubled Forest's advantage on the stroke of half-time and substitute Taiwo Awoniyi rounded off a brilliant display late on. It could have been a different story for Wolves if the excellent Matz Sels had not denied Jorgen Strand Larsen, who also saw an effort cleared off the line by Murillo, with the scoreline at 1-0. How the match unfolded
After a neat one-two with Anthony Elanga at the culmination of a swift counter, Gibbs-White silenced his old club when his deflected finish from near the penalty spot found the bottom-right corner. Strand Larsen somehow fired straight at Murillo with a near-open goal gaping soon after, before Sels parried the Wolves forward’s header. Forest had their goalkeeper to thank again soon after, as he kept out a thumping volley from Rodrigo Gomes. Forest wrapped the win up when Hudson-Odoi played through James Ward-Prowse, who selflessly offloaded for fellow sub Awoniyi to tuck into an empty net. Strand Larsen proved the hero with a late leveller in a 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur last time out, but the forward wasted a glorious opportunity here when directing at Murillo after Hwang Hee-chan's effort had fortuitously fallen his way inside the six-yard box. That gilt-edged chance came shortly after Wolves were cut open far too easily, with Gibbs-White afforded the freedom of his former stomping ground to burst away and exchange with Elanga to score. Pereira, who was missing suspended talisman Matheus Cunha, may have looked at Forest poacher Wood with envy after seeing his striker Strand Larsen pass up another chance in the second half, blasting a right-footed effort just within Sels' stretching reach. Forest mark Clough anniversary in style
Monday marked 50 years since Forest appointed Brian Clough, the legendary manager who guided them to back-to-back European Cups, the English First Division title, and masterminded nine of the club's 11 major honours in their entire history. Therefore, it was fitting on this anniversary that Forest secured their sixth straight top-flight win - heights they had not achieved previously since winning seven consecutive matches under Clough across two campaigns between May and September 1979. A new era of Forest heroes could now await, with Nuno getting one over his former team and masterminding a win that sees his side move five points clear of fifth-placed Newcastle. Nicolas Dominguez's well-timed interception and pass created the space for Gibbs-White's driving run that culminated in the opener, while Hudson-Odoi's rapid turn of pace paved the way for Wood's 12th league goal of the season. Forest had earlier seen penalty appeals for handball turned down - the VAR confirming referee Peter Bankes' call that Ait-Nouri's arm was in a natural position when the defender blocked Ola Aina's cross. Hudson-Odoi, who will surely have impressed the watching England boss Thomas Tuchel, headed over from Jota Silva's delightful delivery in the second period, though Awoniyi made sure of victory after another clinical counter-attack sealed three points on a milestone day for Forest.

Aina's strike seven minutes before the break was a reward for Forest's patience following a bright Brentford start, while it was a defensive error that handed Elanga an early Christmas gift shortly after the interval. Keane Lewis-Potter's mistake was seized upon by the former Manchester United winger, and Brentford never looked likely to mount a comeback from there. Nuno Espirito Santo’s team remain in fourth place, three points above Aston Villa, while Brentford sit 12th. How the match unfolded
The hosts flew out of the blocks as Mikkel Damsgaard forced a diving stop from Matz Sels after just four minutes before Yoane Wissa prodded over the bar following a defensive mix-up for Forest. Having failed to capitalise on those chances, Brentford needed goalkeeper Mark Flekken to be on top form to keep out Chris Wood’s stooping header, though he could do little to prevent Forest taking the lead in the 38th minute. Sels denied Kristoffer Ajer from close range just after the hour, but despite a flurry of changes from Thomas Frank, Brentford failed to test Forest’s resolve. Brentford's bubble burst
Injuries in defence have forced Frank's hand in recent weeks, as the Bees have survived due to the grit and experience still available in his back line, but this game proved to be a bridge too far. Brentford’s unbeaten home record has now been dashed, and Frank will hope to put this down as a bad day at the office ahead of festive fixtures against Brighton and Arsenal. Club reports

Sels denied Kristoffer Ajer from close range just after the hour, but despite a flurry of changes from Thomas Frank, Brentford failed to test Forest’s resolve. Forest’s winter wonderland
Forest fans heading back to Nottingham will be feeling the festive cheer thanks to another smart tactical tweak from Nuno on the road. Williams teed up Aina for the opener and the latter's fine performance helped Elanga to offer another potent threat. With Aina offering the consistent width needed down Forest's right-hand side, Elanga was able to operate slightly infield – as Callum Hudson-Odoi did in tandem with Williams on the opposite flank – and the winger showed great determination, pace and skill to make the most of Keane-Potter’s error. It is turning into a season to remember for Forest, who are guaranteed to go into Christmas in the top four. Both full-backs were targeted in the build-up to Forest's goals, as Williams' dart in behind caught out Ajer, and Lewis-Potter’s mistake was punished by Elanga. Two players covering in slightly unfamiliar positions always brings risk, and they produced positive moments in attack, but a lack of confidence in a fresh role was thrust under the spotlight by a Forest side drilled to perfection.",Nott'm Forest_2024-12-21,brentford,nuno-espirito-santo,thomas-frank,2,0,17,2,0,36,0.9,2,10,3,5,14,303,20,10,4,0,6,0,3,1,6,4,1,0,16,1,3,236,16,46,22,0,48,7,34,20,4,20,18,47,49,2,3,0.9785,2,1,10,64,0.72,1,7,4,9,10,532,17,14,3,0,3,0,2,2,7,0,1,0,37,4,1,452,14,72,26,0,52,10,42,17,11,17,13,51,18,0,4,-0.6411,1,0,6

Forest entered Tuesday's game on a seven-match winning run in all competitions and as the only team to have beaten Liverpool in league action, winning 1-0 at Anfield in September. The result keeps Liverpool six points clear of second-placed Forest, with a game in hand, though their advantage at the summit could be cut to four points if Arsenal can beat Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday. How the match unfolded
Forest demonstrated their counter-attacking prowess within eight minutes as Wood fired them ahead. Anthony Elanga charged through midfield before slipping a pass to the New Zealander, who slotted his finish across Alisson and into the bottom-right corner. Murillo sent a long-range effort whistling over the top as Liverpool struggled to cope with Forest's physicality, with the visitors failing to record a single shot on target before half-time. Sels saved his best stops for last, springing to his right to tip Mohamed Salah's curler over and turning Cody Gakpo's drive around the post, as Forest held on. Forest show their worth
Earlier this week, Liverpool boss Slot outlined his belief that Forest are genuine title challengers, and on Tuesday, they proved they are serious contenders for UEFA Champions League football at the very least. Forest's 3-0 victory at Wolves last week was their sixth in a row in the Premier League, giving them the opportunity to win seven straight league games for the first time since September 1979, when they were European Cup holders and on their way to defending that title. Under the legendary Brian Clough, Forest regularly battled Liverpool for major honours in those days, with the clubs finishing as the top two in the First Division in both 1977/78 and 1978/79, winning a title apiece. Forest's dream season really got going on Merseyside in September, when they produced a memorable rearguard action to clinch the win. Forest did not play like underdogs here though, unsettling Liverpool with their energy and physicality to take a deserved lead. Murillo and Wood – two of Forest's standout performers – allowed Jota to get between them from Tsimikas' corner, nodding home with Liverpool's first shot on target. It was a ruthless reminder that to stay the course in the title race, Forest will have to be perfect. For over an hour, it was more of the same at the City Ground. Club reports

Throughout the first half of the campaign, it appeared Slot's Liverpool could do no wrong. However, the Reds have not quite looked their imperious selves in 2025. Liverpool were lethargic in possession, too often outmuscled in midfield and saw their attackers struggle, with Salah struggling to have an influence. But Liverpool's advantage lies in their strength in depth. When Slot's starters struggled, he threw on Jota and was rewarded with a goal just 22 seconds later. That is the fastest Premier League goal by a Liverpool substitute on record (since 2006/07), and if not for Sels' brilliance between the sticks, the Portugal international – like Salah or Gakpo – might have been the matchwinner. Liverpool's lead at the summit will be cut if Arsenal win Wednesday's north London derby, but with a game in hand and meetings with Brentford, Ipswich Town and AFC Bournemouth up next, Slot's men are still in a strong position.

622,622,arsenal,2025-01-18,"Aston Villa once again dented Arsenal’s Premier League title charge after coming from two goals down to draw 2-2 at the Emirates Stadium. Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz fired the Gunners into the lead, with the hosts looking set to close the gap to leaders Liverpool, who beat Brentford earlier on Saturday. Arsenal thought they had won it when Mikel Merino’s strike deflected off Havertz, with the goal given on-field but overturned by the referee following a VAR review after the ball found its way in off the German’s hand. Villa’s turnaround sees them jump up to seventh in the table, while Arsenal stay second, but are now six points behind Arne Slot’s side, who also have a game in hand. How the match unfolded
The Villans survived Arsenal’s early wave of pressure and almost took the lead when Ian Maatsen stung the palms of Raya. Emiliano Martinez then denied Trossard at the other end, but he was unable to stop Martinelli giving Arsenal the lead, despite his best efforts of clawing the ball away on the line. The Gunners increased their lead 10 minutes after the restart when Trossard teed up Havertz who turned the ball home from close range. Tielemans led the Villa comeback after powerfully heading substitute Lucas Digne’s cross home, with Watkins on target against the Gunners once again with a fierce finish. Havertz thought he had earned a valuable three points when he turned in Merino’s strike, but he was adjudged to have used his hand by the referee following a VAR review. Merino then struck the post late on, with Trossard seeing his strike from close range brilliantly saved by Martinez as the Gunners were unable to find the breakthrough in stoppage time. Gunners falter against nemesis
In April 2024, Arsenal saw their title bid dented following a 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners started the contest strongly, being forward with their possession and deservedly taking the lead through Martinelli. Arsenal continued to go in search of their second goal, with Havertz heading Martin Odegaard’s free-kick over as Myles Lewis-Skelly’s teasing cross threatened to cause trouble for Villa, but no one in red was there to tuck the ball into the net. Havertz then grabbed the goal their dominance merited, but the hosts were unable to hold their lead as two goals in eight minutes saw them capitulate in front of their home supporters. But they had chances to win it late on, with Havertz’s ruled out goal followed up by efforts from Merino, who struck the post, and Trossard’s strike that was saved by Martinez. Arsenal will be looking to bounce back from the draw next week against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Villa play the villains once again
Much of the talk surrounding the fixture was Arsenal’s pursuit of leaders Liverpool, but Aston Villa lived up to their name to keep their own European ambitions alive. Having posed a threat to Arsenal in recent fixtures against them, Watkins was again troubling the hosts’ defence early on, who were without William Saliba through injury. Unai Emery’s gameplan seemingly allowed Arsenal to enjoy possession but looked to hit them on the break. Watkins proved a tricky customer to handle for Jurrien Timber and Gabriel Magalhaes, with the England international almost punishing Thomas Partey’s wayward throw-in just two minutes before Martinelli opened the scoring. Though handed a hammer blow by Havertz’s goal, the visitors continued to be a threat in the final third and grabbed a goal through Tielemans, with Emery’s substitute at half-time, Digne, providing the assist. Watkins scored in their 2-0 win over the Gunners last year and got himself on the scoresheet again with a fine finish. Club reports

624,624,ipswich-town,2025-01-16,"Brighton & Hove Albion ended a run of eight Premier League matches without a win by beating Ipswich Town 2-0 at Portman Road. Ipswich did threaten in the first half as Liam Delap and Omari Hutchinson forced Bart Verbruggen into decent stops. They are just four points adrift of sixth-placed Manchester City, while Ipswich drop back into the relegation zone on goals scored, with Wolverhampton Wanderers moving back up to 17th despite Wednesday's 3-0 loss at Newcastle United. Ipswich grew in confidence as the half wore on, with Nathan Broadhead, Delap and Hutchinson all making the Brighton stopper work from distance but failing to find the breakthrough. The Tractor Boys created the first clear chance of the second half, too, when Wes Burns' snapshot from a corner rolled wide. Tough lesson for Walton
Ipswich had taken four points from their previous two league matches against Chelsea and Fulham, matching their tally from their seven previous outings, and they showed glimpses of why in this match, particularly in the first half. The Tractor Boys had avoided conceding a goal from open play in either of those matches, which coincided with the return of goalkeeper Walton to the starting XI. Manchester City and Liverpool are Ipswich's next two opponents, ahead of a huge six-pointer against Southampton on February 1. The Seagulls had already finished all square against each of the league's bottom four clubs this season, drawing at home to Ipswich, Wolves and Southampton, as well as on the road at Leicester last month. And this was the type of match in which they could have been frustrated once more, with Ipswich putting plenty of pressure on in the first half. Club reports

Second-half goals from Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter were enough to seal victory for the Seagulls, boosting their hopes of European qualification. But Mitoma smuggled in an effort just short of the hour mark before Rutter's clever flick made the points safe nine minutes from time, taking Brighton up to ninth in the table. How the match unfolded
The visitors started a quiet first half on the front foot but only had a long-range Mitoma shot to show for it. Ipswich grew in confidence as the half wore on, with Nathan Broadhead, Delap and Hutchinson all making the Brighton stopper work from distance but failing to find the breakthrough. But they were undone a couple of minutes later as Brighton took the lead. Yasin Ayari and Matt O'Riley combined to tee up Mitoma inside the box, and the winger's shot squeezed under Walton and into the net. Fabian Hurzeler's side were in control from there, Joao Pedro forcing a good save from Walton before Rutter put the result beyond doubt, spinning to flick home from close range, with the on-field decision to award the goal confirmed after a VAR review for offside. Walton was generally in solid form again on Thursday, making three saves, but he will reflect that he could have done better with Mitoma's goal, the shot squeezing underneath his outstretched arm and into the net. Brighton find a way
Brighton have drawn far too many matches in their quest for European football, so a return to winning ways will come as a relief to Hurzeler. The Seagulls had already finished all square against each of the league's bottom four clubs this season, drawing at home to Ipswich, Wolves and Southampton, as well as on the road at Leicester last month. But they finally proved that they have a side capable of beating teams towards the bottom of the table when a nicely worked move ended with Mitoma giving them the lead. Rutter emerged from the bench to make it two, with Lewis Dunk, Yankuba Minteh and Danny Welbeck also producing impressive cameos to showcase Brighton's strength in depth. Club reports

626,626,manchester-united,2025-01-16,"Amad proved Manchester United's hero as his late hat-trick secured an unlikely 3-1 comeback victory over struggling Southampton. United seemed destined for a humbling home defeat to the Premier League's bottom side after Manuel Ugarte turned Tyler Dibling's flick-on past Andre Onana just two minutes before half-time. However, Amad – who levelled late on in United's 2-2 draw with Liverpool last time out in the league – equalised with just eight minutes remaining after steering under Aaron Ramsdale. The victory lifts United to 12th in the table, while Southampton – who still have just one win in the 2024/25 campaign – remain 10 points adrift of safety at the bottom of the league. How the match unfolded
Alejandro Garnacho steered a glorious chance wide in the 20th minute before Onana produced a remarkable double save to deny Dibling and Mateus Fernandes' follow-up attempt from point-blank range at the other end. However, Onana had no answer when Dibling's near-post header from Fernandes' corner deflected off Ugarte and squirmed past the United goalkeeper's right hand just minutes before the interval. Antony should have equalised in the second half but somehow guided Garnacho's left-sided cross straight at Ramsdale, though Amad made amends when drilling under the Southampton goalkeeper after linking up with Joshua Zirkzee. Amad gets United out of trouble
It appeared United would falter once again at Old Trafford, where they had lost their last three league matches before this eye-catching comeback. Garnacho should have opened the scoring midway through the first half, profiting from Rasmus Hojlund's fine turn of pace before directing wide when unmarked. Kobbie Mainoo then inexplicably attempted to square for Garnacho when one-on-one with Ramsdale and those missed chances came back to haunt Ruben Amorim's side before the break. Antony's close-range miss on the hour left all inside Old Trafford scratching their heads before Bruno Fernandes' delicate chip was turned away by Ramsdale as United increased the pressure late on. His work rate came to the fore once more with just seconds remaining, forcing Harwood-Bellis into an uncharacteristic mistake that sealed an emphatic performance from United's new hero. Amorim will hope his other United players can take inspiration from the brilliance of Amad when they host Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday. Slick Southampton punished again
Southampton did not look like a side that had managed just one league win – a 1-0 triumph over Everton in early November – after dominating for large periods against United. Kamaldeen Sulemana's quick feet made light work of Leny Yoro early on before his right-footed effort was pushed away by Onana, who was then on hand to stop a tame Mateus Fernandes effort soon after. Southampton's Fernandes then simply had to score before the half-hour mark, controlling inside the six-yard box after Dibling's attempt deflected into the area before blasting straight at Onana.

Rogers, formerly of Man City, made sure of the three points against Pep Guardiola’s out-of-form side at Villa Park in the 65th minute, slotting in from just inside the box after an impressive run. The 21-year-old had set up Villa’s first-half opener, unselfishly teeing up Jhon Duran, who netted for a third consecutive Premier League game. Unai Emery’s side leapfrog City into fifth, only outside the top four on goal difference, with the Citizens now 11 points behind leaders Liverpool as their title defence slips further out of their hands. How the match unfolded
Villa started with intent, John McGinn picking Josko Gvardiol’s pocket to tee up Duran inside the opening 20 seconds, but Stefan Ortega tipped the Colombian’s long-range strike wide. But Villa did eventually find a first-half breakthrough straight through the middle of City, with Rogers teeing up Duran to fire home first time. Rogers steals the show
While a lot has been made of City’s slump, Villa’s form has also been up-and-down in recent weeks, having given up two late goals in their defeat to Nottingham Forest last weekend. Another midfielder in Youri Tielemans, who was making his 200th Premier League appearance, made the first goal possible as he received the pass from Emiliano Martinez while under pressure from Mateo Kovacic, but he kept his cool to brush off the Croatian and pick out Rogers. He could have had a second assist late on too as he once again drifted through City’s midfield with little resistance, though Ollie Watkins’ shot was smothered by Ortega. City’s problems go on
Guardiola was downbeat after City's late defeat to Manchester United last weekend, but was back up for the challenge of turning their fortunes around ahead of their trip to Villa Park. But the ease with which Villa opened them up in the 16th minute will be a worry to Guardiola, as it took the hosts just two passes to get from Martinez to Rogers in the final third. City did up the pressure after going behind, with their best chance falling to Foden in the first half after playing a clever one-two with Rico Lewis, but Martinez stretched to tip it wide of the post. Guardiola will potentially think himself fortunate that the match only ended 2-0 given the chances Villa had, but he desperately needs solutions before they face Everton on Boxing Day. Club reports

629,629,manchester-city,2024-12-21,"Morgan Rogers scored one and assisted another as Aston Villa got back to winning ways with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday. Rogers, formerly of Man City, made sure of the three points against Pep Guardiola’s out-of-form side at Villa Park in the 65th minute, slotting in from just inside the box after an impressive run. After struggling to pose a threat for much of the match, City got a stoppage-time consolation goal through Phil Foden. Unai Emery’s side leapfrog City into fifth, only outside the top four on goal difference, with the Citizens now 11 points behind leaders Liverpool as their title defence slips further out of their hands. But Villa did eventually find a first-half breakthrough straight through the middle of City, with Rogers teeing up Duran to fire home first time. Duran beat Ortega one-v-one six minutes after the break, only to be denied by the offside flag, but shortly after the hour mark, Rogers picked up the ball deep in his own half and brushed off City’s midfield to play a one-two with McGinn before slotting it into the far bottom corner. In stoppage time, Savinho’s weaving run opened the space for Foden, who got a bit of fortune as the ball ricocheted back to him, and calmly slotted in his first league goal of the campaign.

Guardiola was downbeat after City's late defeat to Manchester United last weekend, but was back up for the challenge of turning their fortunes around ahead of their trip to Villa Park. Even with more defensive injury worries piling up – both Ederson and Ruben Dias were missing for the champions – City’s backline looked capable. But the ease with which Villa opened them up in the 16th minute will be a worry to Guardiola, as it took the hosts just two passes to get from Martinez to Rogers in the final third. City did up the pressure after going behind, with their best chance falling to Foden in the first half after playing a clever one-two with Rico Lewis, but Martinez stretched to tip it wide of the post. Erling Haaland endured another quiet game with little service, while Jack Grealish’s threat from the first half did not carry into the second. They will be boosted by Foden getting off the mark in the league, but it is a crumb of comfort.

630,630,chelsea,2025-01-14,"A stoppage-time free kick by Reece James rescued a point for Chelsea as they drew 2-2 with AFC Bournemouth, although their winless run in the Premier League stretched to five matches. The home side dominated the opening stages of the encounter and went ahead early on through a nerveless finish by Cole Palmer after great work by Nicolas Jackson. The visitors looked to have hung on for a first win at Stamford Bridge since 2019 but were undone through James’ sumptuous effort in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Chelsea remain fourth in the table, while Bournemouth stay seventh and trail fifth-placed Newcastle United by just one point, having played one match more. How the match unfolded
The Blues took the lead with their first opportunity of the match as Jackson saw him wriggle away into space and thread a perfectly-weighted pass to Palmer, who coolly slotted home. Chelsea then broke quickly, with Jackson also rattling the woodwork. Bournemouth were awarded a penalty five minutes into the second half after Moises Caicedo bundled over Semenyo, with Kluivert sending Robert Sanchez the wrong way. Chelsea offered little as an attacking threat during the latter stages of the match but still earned a point following a moment of quality from substitute James. Late point doesn’t paper over Chelsea cracks
Despite a 5-0 victory over Morecambe in the third round of the FA Cup at the weekend, Enzo Maresca’s side have endured a worrying slump in league form which has seen his side slide down the table after almost going top before Christmas. They did start well, going ahead early on through Palmer. Jackson could have scored a hat-trick before the half-time whistle and his lack of ruthlessness in front of goal once again will cause concern for Maresca and Chelsea. Another running theme has been Chelsea’s inability to hold onto leads, with the Blues now squandering one-goal advantages against Fulham, Crystal Palace and tonight’s opponents during this recent run. A positive, however, will be the return of James and a moment of quality by him towards the end in another season that has been blighted by injury. Chelsea next play Wolves at home in five days as they look to get their league form back on track and earn their first Premier League win of 2025. But they defended their box brilliantly, with defender Illia Zabarnyi blocking everything in sight and managing to keep a free-flowing Chelsea at bay for large swathes of the half. They were much-improved going forward after the break, earning an early penalty and stretching Chelsea’s backline before Semenyo popped up with a goal that looked to have handed them all three points before James’ late free kick.

Former Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea boss Potter, who was appointed by the Hammers last week, saw his side overcome a slightly slow start to lead 2-0 at half-time, with Carlos Soler pouncing on Andreas Pereira's error before Tomas Soucek netted a second goal. Alex Iwobi pulled one back as his cross floated in, but West Ham restored their two-goal advantage after another Fulham mishap, Danny Ings tackling Bernd Leno before Lucas Paqueta finished. Another unorthodox Iwobi goal brought Fulham back into the game once more at London Stadium, yet Marco Silva's men could not force an equaliser. Victory moves West Ham up to 12th, now just four points behind ninth-placed Fulham. How the match unfolded
Visitors Fulham were superior in the opening exchanges and went close when Harry Wilson volleyed Iwobi's cross onto the bar, but West Ham rode out that difficult period and struck twice in quick succession just after the half-hour mark. Another gift had West Ham two in front again, though, as Ings pinched the ball from Leno to leave Paqueta a straightforward finish. Potter weaves his magic
Potter's first Premier League match in charge West Ham produced three points, providing some overdue positivity at London Stadium. The Hammers had won just two of their previous eight league games, a run that concluded with the departure of Julen Lopetegui, but moved 10 points clear of the bottom three with this win and can now breathe easy. In the absence of injured trio Jarrod Bowen, Michail Antonio and Niclas Fullkrug, Potter fielded a system with no out-and-out striker and lots of fluidity in attack – a hallmark of his previous teams that may be on show again against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Fulham were the better side at the London Stadium until Pereira's mistake, while Paqueta's goal came just as the away side were coming on strong again. Club reports

Visitors Fulham were superior in the opening exchanges and went close when Harry Wilson volleyed Iwobi's cross onto the bar, but West Ham rode out that difficult period and struck twice in quick succession just after the half-hour mark. Pereira hit a misdirected pass across the face of his own box straight to Soler, who caressed the ball into the far corner as Leno rushed back, before Soucek dispatched Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross into the roof of the net only 131 seconds later. Raul Jimenez also hit the frame of the goal before the break, and Fulham did hit back shortly after the restart when Iwobi's delivery crept in without a touch from a team-mate. Another gift had West Ham two in front again, though, as Ings pinched the ball from Leno to leave Paqueta a straightforward finish. Iwobi scored a goal almost identical to his first with 12 minutes to play, yet the nearest Fulham came to an equaliser saw Adama Traore blast over in stoppage time. Fulham struck the woodwork twice in the opening 45 minutes, with the impressive Iwobi teeing up both efforts. Cottagers keep conceding
Fulham have earned deserved plaudits for their performances this season, never looking in any danger of relegation and threatening to put themselves in the race for European football. But Silva will be frustrated that his side's habit of shooting themselves in the foot is derailing those efforts. Fulham were the better side at the London Stadium until Pereira's mistake, while Paqueta's goal came just as the away side were coming on strong again. The Cottagers have now conceded seven goals in three league games, and while they managed to take a point from each of the previous two, needing to score three times to do the same was one step too far. While Fulham were unbeaten in eight prior to this defeat, six of those matches had ended as a draw, and Silva must work to cut out the errors at the back to ensure this season does not fizzle out.

634,634,tottenham-hotspur,2024-12-22,"Liverpool stormed four points clear at the top of the Premier League heading into Christmas with a thrilling 6-3 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Having been buoyed by Chelsea’s earlier draw at Everton, Liverpool took full advantage of the Blues’ slip-up with a dominant display at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where Spurs did briefly offer hope of a fightback. Liverpool led 3-1 by the interval – Luis Diaz, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai on target, with James Maddison having scored for the hosts. The Reds will top the tree at Christmas for the first time since the 2020/21 season, while 11th-placed Spurs must lick their wounds ahead of a tough trip to in-form Nottingham Forest on Boxing Day. Liverpool added a second 13 minutes later – Mac Allister gambling on a loose ball to send a looping header over Fraser Forster – though the Argentinian was at fault when Maddison robbed him of possession and bent in a low finish. Salah scored again just after the hour, slotting in from Szoboszlai’s neat pass, though Spurs rallied, first through Kulusevski’s excellent volley and then Solanke’s close-range prod. Rampant Reds get their Christmas wish
Liverpool will top the table on Christmas Day for the first time since the 2020/21 season, though it is worth noting that only once in the last seven top-flight campaigns in which they have sat at the summit on 25 December, have they gone on to win the title. They exposed Spurs’ high line time and time again, in counter-attacks reminiscent of the very best of the Jurgen Klopp era. Salah was, as he has been all season, supreme – his two second-half finishes took him fourth on Liverpool’s all-time goalscorer list. Spurs’ second-choice goalkeeper denied Alexander-Arnold twice, first from a fantastic free-kick and then from a shot from a tight angle. That full-throttle approach from Slot did leave Liverpool fragile at the back, but they took on Spurs at their own game and came out on top. Spurs given something to cheer, but form must pick up
At 5-1 down, matters really did look grim for Ange Postecoglou, who was left shaking his head on the sideline. It was Solanke’s clever chip that was deflected on into the area for Kulusevski to volley home, before the former Bournemouth striker diverted Brennan Johnson’s header beyond Alisson Becker. Postecoglou will not change his approach – that much is certain – but the fans may not be as forgiving as they were on Sunday, when Spurs did come up against what is arguably the best team in Europe as it stands. A trip to the City Ground is no small challenge for Spurs next, and they are far from where they want to be in the standings. Indeed, a defeat at Forest would see them drop 11 points adrift of the top four, so the time for Spurs to show some consistency is now. Club reports

After seeing a glut of chances fall by the wayside – including Salah hitting the woodwork – Liverpool deservedly went ahead in the 23rd minute when Trent Alexander-Arnold’s exquisite cross was headed home by Diaz. Liverpool added a second 13 minutes later – Mac Allister gambling on a loose ball to send a looping header over Fraser Forster – though the Argentinian was at fault when Maddison robbed him of possession and bent in a low finish. Yet Liverpool’s two-goal cushion was restored on the stroke of half-time when Salah slipped in Szoboszlai, who finished coolly, and the Egyptian turned from provider to scorer nine minutes after the restart as he tapped into a gaping net following a blistering counter-attack. Salah scored again just after the hour, slotting in from Szoboszlai’s neat pass, though Spurs rallied, first through Kulusevski’s excellent volley and then Solanke’s close-range prod.

Liverpool will top the table on Christmas Day for the first time since the 2020/21 season, though it is worth noting that only once in the last seven top-flight campaigns in which they have sat at the summit on 25 December, have they gone on to win the title. The Reds were held to frustrating draws by Fulham and Newcastle United in their last two league outings, but when they are on top form in attack, they can be unstoppable, and at times on Sunday they were just that. They set the tone early when Salah pounced on Forster’s error, only to fire into the side netting. He then saw an attempt clatter the crossbar and two efforts blocked by Djed Spence, before Alexander-Arnold delivered a sensational cross from which Diaz could hardly miss. This Liverpool display was different to many that have come so far under Arne Slot, though. Salah was, as he has been all season, supreme – his two second-half finishes took him fourth on Liverpool’s all-time goalscorer list.

636,636,everton,2025-01-15,"Ollie Watkins’ second-half strike ensured David Moyes’ second stint in charge of Everton began with a 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa. Following Sean Dyche’s departure, the Scotsman returned to Goodison Park this week – just under 12 years after his successful first spell came to an end with him leaving for Manchester United. Villa climb a place to seventh and within three points of the top four, while Everton remain 16th and just a point clear of the relegation zone. How the match unfolded
Villa carried the greater attacking threat early on as Jordan Pickford pushed away Rogers' curling effort and James Tarkowski's strong block thwarted Youri Tielemans before a loose pass from Ashley Young released Watkins, who shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat. Everton gradually found their way into the match and Dominic Calvert-Lewin drilled narrowly wide from Vitalii Mykolenko's long ball, with the striker also seeing a shot cleared off the line by Boubacar Kamara. Rogers pounced on a loose ball in midfield and released Watkins, who calmly slotted past Pickford. Everton generally struggled to trouble their opponents’ defence, though they saw a golden opportunity to equalise go begging in stoppage time, with Calvert-Lewin firing over from Jesper Lindstrom’s cross. No happy homecoming for Moyes
Back in March 2002, Moyes stepped out at Goodison Park as Walter Smith’s successor, commencing an 11-year stay with the Toffees, who he would lead to nine top-eight finishes in the Premier League. Just shy of 23 years later, it was a case of déjà vu for Moyes after replacing Dyche at the start of the week. But the fact they have now failed to score in nine of their last 11 league matches was epitomised by Calvert-Lewin’s late opportunity that he could not keep down. While there were positives to build on, the lack of goals is a cause for concern, and something Moyes will look to address by the time his side welcome Tottenham Hotspur to Goodison Park on Sunday. Nevertheless, the visitors were quickly into their stride at Goodison Park, where they had kept a clean sheet on their three most recent visits. Aside from Calvert-Lewin’s last-gasp chance, the Villa defence were untroubled after taking the lead and eventually saw out all three points. Match reports

Starting a calendar year with back-to-back league wins for the first time since 2009 under Martin O’Neill, Emery will return to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal on Saturday with his side carrying momentum.

638,638,leicester-city,2025-01-15,"Crystal Palace condemned Leicester City to a sixth straight Premier League defeat with a 2-0 win at King Power Stadium. Two second-half goals were enough for Palace, who rode some early pressure from Leicester before pulling clear, with Jamie Vardy notably going close in the opening exchanges. The defeat leaves Leicester in 19th, two points from safety, while Palace leapfrog Manchester United into 14th. How the match unfolded
Vardy was typically at the centre of the action early on with two efforts on goal in the first two minutes, the second whistling just beyond a post. Leicester threatened an equaliser, with Soumare’s rifled effort from the edge of the box beating Henderson, only to smack the crossbar. Foxes fizzle out
Leicester laid the foundations for a much-improved performance within the first two minutes, Facundo Buonanotte winning the ball back deep in Palace’s half and teeing up Vardy, whose shot was blocked. Vardy twice went close again as his side played with the type of gusto not always evident at home this season. Soumare will feel unlucky that he was denied by the bar, while Stephy Mavididi headed wide, but a sixth straight loss can largely be blamed on failing to capitalise on those early chances. Palace have beaten the current bottom three – Ipswich Town, Southampton and now Leicester – on that run, as well as a memorable victory away at rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. On-loan defender Trevoh Chalobah was recalled by Chelsea hours before kick-off but a back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Guehi managed to keep Leicester at bay. Match reports

639,639,crystal-palace,2025-01-15,"Crystal Palace condemned Leicester City to a sixth straight Premier League defeat with a 2-0 win at King Power Stadium. Two second-half goals were enough for Palace, who rode some early pressure from Leicester before pulling clear, with Jamie Vardy notably going close in the opening exchanges. However, Jean-Philippe Mateta was the more clinical of the two strikers, neatly rounding Jakub Stolarczyk to give Palace the lead seven minutes into the second half. The defeat leaves Leicester in 19th, two points from safety, while Palace leapfrog Manchester United into 14th. Palace grew into the game as the half went on – Mateta volleying over after Daniel Munoz closed down Victor Kristiansen’s clearance, while Will Hughes drilled over from distance. The visitors came flying out of the blocks after the break though, with Mateta latching onto Ismaila Sarr’s wonderful pass before rounding Stolarczyk, who was left scrambling, to fire into an empty net. Guehi then put the match beyond doubt late on, meeting Eberechi Eze’s scooped set-piece to volley it into the roof of the net. Foxes fizzle out
Leicester laid the foundations for a much-improved performance within the first two minutes, Facundo Buonanotte winning the ball back deep in Palace’s half and teeing up Vardy, whose shot was blocked. The defensive frailties that have set them back were on show again after half-time, Sarr managing to thread a ball through for Mateta to take one of the few clear chances the visitors created. Sturdy Eagles soar
Palace may not have played the swashbuckling football they are capable of in this win, but they proved they are such a solid team that it does not matter. Oliver Glasner’s side have now only lost one of their last 10 Premier League matches, against title-chasing Arsenal, as they climbed eight points clear of the relegation zone. Palace have beaten the current bottom three – Ipswich Town, Southampton and now Leicester – on that run, as well as a memorable victory away at rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. Those results suggest a comfortable mid-table finish is likely, but this win warrants particular credit considering the defensive reshuffle Glasner had to oversee in the build-up. At the other end, Sarr stood out in attack, the forward continuing to grow in confidence on his return to English football by setting up Mateta’s goal with an intelligent through-ball, before forcing Stolarczyk into a stoppage-time save that would have put the icing on the cake.

640,640,newcastle-united,2025-01-15,"Newcastle United extended their Premier League winning streak to six matches and climbed into the top four as Alexander Isak's outstanding form continued in a 3-0 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Isak scored a goal in each half at St James' Park, with his 34th-minute opener making him just the fourth different player to net in eight successive Premier League matches. Isak added an assist for Anthony Gordon's goal as Newcastle leapfrogged Chelsea to go fourth in the table. Eddie Howe's Magpies are just three points behind third-placed Nottingham Forest, while Wolves slip below Ipswich Town on goal difference and into the relegation zone, ahead of Ipswich hosting Brighton and Hove Albion on Thursday. How the match unfolded
Jacob Murphy fired two early warning shots, with Jose Sa brilliantly thwarting the Magpies winger from close range on one occasion, before Isak took centre stage. But Newcastle stepped things up in the second half, with Isak finding space to take in Bruno Guimaraes' clever pass and finish from the centre of the box for 2-0. Isak then took advantage of more slack Wolves defending to tee up Gordon for a tap-in in the 74th minute. Murphy the unsung hero
The headlines will all go to Isak after he scored in an eighth successive Premier League game, a feat only previously achieved by Jamie Vardy (twice), Ruud van Nistelrooy (twice) and Daniel Sturridge. Gordon joined the Swede on the scoresheet late on, but they were not the only Newcastle attackers to make an impact, with Murphy putting in another energetic performance on the right-hand side. Howe's men continually targeted Wolves' left-hand side in the early stages, and if not for a brilliant reflex save from Sa, Murphy would have hit a 24th-minute opener. That approach continued to pay dividends after the break, and the moves for Newcastle's second and third goals were both started on the right flank and finished from the left side of the box. The right side of Newcastle's attack was viewed as a question mark at the start of the campaign as Murphy prepared to battle for minutes with Harvey Barnes and Miguel Almiron. However, Murphy has enjoyed an excellent season to date and, despite not getting among the goals on Wednesday, he should get another chance to impress against AFC Bournemouth on Saturday. While there was more than a hint of fortune about Isak's first goal, he could hardly have wished for an easier second, being played onside by Emmanuel Agbadou and left totally free near the penalty spot by Bueno.

641,641,wolverhampton,2025-01-15,"Newcastle United extended their Premier League winning streak to six matches and climbed into the top four as Alexander Isak's outstanding form continued in a 3-0 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Wolves twice hit the woodwork through Jorgen Strand Larsen and saw a late Santiago Bueno goal overturned by VAR for handball, but some poor defending proved costly for the visitors. Eddie Howe's Magpies are just three points behind third-placed Nottingham Forest, while Wolves slip below Ipswich Town on goal difference and into the relegation zone, ahead of Ipswich hosting Brighton and Hove Albion on Thursday. After a promising Wolves break collapsed in the 34th minute, he fired home the opener via a big deflection off Rayan Ait-Nouri. The visitors went close to levelling just before half-time as Larsen struck the outside of the post from 12 yards out following good work from Rodrigo Gomes. Isak then took advantage of more slack Wolves defending to tee up Gordon for a tap-in in the 74th minute. Wolves could not launch a fightback, with Bueno's close-range finish chalked off when a VAR review found he had handled the ball immediately before scoring, while Strand Larsen saw a late effort tipped onto the crossbar by Martin Dubravka. Howe's men continually targeted Wolves' left-hand side in the early stages, and if not for a brilliant reflex save from Sa, Murphy would have hit a 24th-minute opener. Cunha comeback a positive for Wolves
In Wolves' previous league outing they suffered the first setback of the Vitor Pereira era as they went down 3-0 to surprise package Nottingham Forest. Star forward Matheus Cunha missed that one through suspension, and he made his return from the bench here, replacing Hwang Hee-chan at half-time after the South Korean struggled to make an impact. Wolves did manage a few dangerous forays forward without Cunha on the pitch, with Goncalo Guedes dragging one shot wide from a promising position prior to Strand Larsen striking the woodwork for the first time. The visitors continued to generate opportunities in the second half, with Cunha seeing one effort flash wide of the bottom-right corner, while he also teed up fellow substitute Pablo Sarabia to fire straight at Dubravka late on. But Wolves' problems this season have predominantly come at the other end of the field. Cunha's return is a major positive for Wolves, but they must improve at the other end of the pitch if they are to get out of trouble, particularly with a trip to Chelsea up next on Monday.

642,642,manchester-united,2024-12-22,"AFC Bournemouth stunned Manchester United with a thumping 3-0 victory to move up to fifth spot in the table as Ruben Amorim's mixed start in charge at Old Trafford continued. Man Utd beat Manchester City with a late turnaround last weekend, though this showing was more in keeping with Thursday's chaotic EFL Cup loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Dean Huijsen silenced the home crowd by heading home Ryan Christie's free-kick, his 29th-minute opener exposing United's set-piece frailties again on Sunday. This win lifts high-flying Bournemouth - unbeaten in five matches - to fifth in the table and just three points adrift of the top four, while United's struggles leave them 13th. It is the first time in Premier League history that Man Utd will be in the bottom half of the table at Christmas. How the match unfolded
Chances were hard to come by in the opening stages as Amad tamely fired straight at Kepa Arrizabalaga, while Semenyo tested Andre Onana's handling from range at the other end. United were unhappy that Tyrell Malacia's lunge on Adam Smith was deemed a foul, and home frustration heightened when Huijsen deftly headed Ryan Christie's resulting free-kick into the top-left corner. Bruno Fernandes went close three times to levelling before the break, twice pulling narrowly wide either side of forcing a smart stop from Kepa after Kobbie Mainoo's offload. Semenyo followed that up by sweeping beyond Onana from Dango Ouattara's low pullback before Leny Yoro somehow failed to score from close range as disappointed United supporters were already heading for the exit. Much to ponder for Amorim
A 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth at Old Trafford last season marked one of many low points under Erik ten Hag, and this loss by an identical scoreline against the same opponents shows just how much work Amorim has to do. An otherwise slow opening from the hosts saw Amad rush a low drive after smart work from Mainoo and Fernandes, who then dipped a long-range effort straight at Kepa. Set-piece troubles proved Man Utd's undoing once more for Huijsen's opener that left Onana motionless before captain Fernandes went on a one-man conquest in search of a leveller. Fernandes dragged a shot wide from the edge of the area from Amad's pass, aimed at Kepa following Mainoo's quick feet, and finished the half by arrowing narrowly wide from long distance. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho were introduced before the hour and both had chances after the damage was already done; the former drew a smart Kepa stop after the latter had raced through and been denied by the Bournemouth goalkeeper. Another disappointing performance at both ends of the pitch means United – who visit a Wolverhampton Wanderers side on Boxing Day fresh from a 3-0 win at Leicester City – will spend Christmas in the bottom half of the table for the first time since the 1989/90 season, when they were 12th. Andoni Iraola's side asserted their authority from the off, with Semenyo driving straight at Onana from range before Kluivert slipped when attempting a similar effort. United may have had complaints about Malacia's foul on Smith, but Bournemouth deservedly capitalised on a strong opening when Christie's floated free-kick delivery found the almighty leap of Huijsen. Huijsen's erroneous pass almost allowed Mainoo to tee up Fernandes for a first-half leveller, but Kepa stood firm to parry away as United increased the pressure. Semenyo blazed over immediately after the interval when Onana's positioning was questionable, though the Bournemouth man made no mistake from near the penalty spot to make it 3-0 after Kluivert's left-sided run brought the earlier spot-kick.

This win lifts high-flying Bournemouth - unbeaten in five matches - to fifth in the table and just three points adrift of the top four, while United's struggles leave them 13th.

The Cottagers were restricted to speculative efforts in the first half but went closest in the 67th minute as Harry Wilson’s close-range effort was kept out by the fit-again Southampton goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. While Southampton remain bottom of the table with six points from 17 matches, Fulham sit ninth on 25 points. How the match unfolded
Fulham started the brighter of the two sides, with Southampton managing to limit them largely to shots from distance in the first half. Wilson saw two strikes from the edge of the box sail over the crossbar in the space of two minutes while Iwobi narrowly missed with his attempt to curl a shot into the top corner just after the half-hour mark. Southampton pushed forward after the break, eventually testing Bernd Leno for the first time in the 56th minute, though Adam Armstrong’s effort was straight at the goalkeeper. Ramsdale made his best save of the match to deny Wilson shortly after, as the midfielder met a Traore cross at the far post with a fierce shot. Fulham had one last chance for a breakthrough with three minutes left on the clock when Traore picked up possession at the edge of the box, but his left-footed strike sailed inches wide of the goal. Encouragement for Juric
Newly-appointed Southampton manager Juric only had a watching brief at Craven Cottage as Rusk continued in interim charge for the second consecutive match. Frustration for Silva
Fulham came into the fixture having scored in their last 15 Premier League outings and would have fancied their chances to keep that run going against a Southampton defence that had conceded 36 goals over their first 16 matches. Though the hosts dominated the possession and chances in the first half, Marco Silva would not have been pleased with his side’s toothless display as they only really tested Ramsdale once, when Iwobi’s cross whistled dangerously close to the goal in the third minute. The Nigeria international would go close with a strike from outside the box again before the end of the half as Silva’s side failed to find a breakthrough despite the introductions of Raul Jimenez and Traore in the second half. Wilson was also a threat, missing his own gilt-edged chance to snatch a win in the second half, but he could not beat Ramsdale after finding a way through Southampton’s stubborn defence. A win would have moved Fulham level on points with champions Manchester City in seventh place, but Fulham will now hope to get back on track when they face west London rivals Chelsea on Boxing Day.

646,646,leicester-city,2024-12-22,"Wolverhampton Wanderers made a dream start to life under Vitor Pereira, who oversaw a 3-0 victory over Leicester City in his first Premier League match in charge. The visitors hit the ground running under Pereira, who replaced Gary O’Neil earlier this week, while also notching their first ever top-flight triumph at King Power Stadium. Matheus Cunha was also on target before the break to put the contest beyond the Foxes, who suffered their first home defeat under Ruud van Nistelrooy. Wolves’ victory saw them leapfrog Ipswich Town to 18th place and move within two points of the Foxes, who remain in 17th. Leicester looked to respond after the break, with Jamie Vardy hitting the side-netting from a tight angle, before heading straight at Jose Sa minutes later. The Foxes carried the greater attacking threat for large periods of the second half, with Vardy again thwarted by the Wolves goalkeeper late on from inside the penalty area. Leicester draw first home blank
The Foxes made a decent start under Van Nistelrooy, with four points from his opening two matches in charge, before the Dutchman was handed a reality check courtesy of last weekend’s resounding 4-0 defeat at Newcastle United. After Sa raced out of goal to deny Vardy early on, his side’s defensive frailties were exposed once more. Vardy went close to halving the deficit, though Toti Gomes’ excellent goalline clearance to deny him proved crucial, with the visitors quickly going down the other end and making it 3-0. However, it never looked likely that Leicester would return the favour, as they failed to find the net at home for the first time this season, with leaders Liverpool up next on Boxing Day.

647,647,wolverhampton,2024-12-22,"Wolverhampton Wanderers made a dream start to life under Vitor Pereira, who oversaw a 3-0 victory over Leicester City in his first Premier League match in charge. Goals from Goncalo Guedes and Rodrigo Gomes put Wolves in charge of the Midlands derby between two of the division’s bottom four sides. Matheus Cunha was also on target before the break to put the contest beyond the Foxes, who suffered their first home defeat under Ruud van Nistelrooy. Wolves’ victory saw them leapfrog Ipswich Town to 18th place and move within two points of the Foxes, who remain in 17th. How the match unfolded
Wolves opened the scoring in the 19th minute when Nelson Semedo's lofted ball into the box was neatly hooked into the far-left corner by Guedes. The visitors doubled their advantage in the 36th minute, with a breakdown in communication between James Justin and Danny Ward allowing Gomes to bundle home Matt Doherty's searching pass. Wolves then grabbed a third goal a minute before the break, with Guedes this time turning provider for Cunha to fire home his ninth goal of the season, with the aid of a touch from Ward. The Foxes carried the greater attacking threat for large periods of the second half, with Vardy again thwarted by the Wolves goalkeeper late on from inside the penalty area. Wolves could have added further gloss to the scoreline when an unmarked Joao Gomes headed wide in the 83rd minute, though at that point, the three points were safely in the bag. Justin and Ward were then clearly on different wavelengths for Wolves’ second goal, as the former let Doherty’s hopeful ball run on, expecting his goalkeeper to come and collect. Vardy went close to halving the deficit, though Toti Gomes’ excellent goalline clearance to deny him proved crucial, with the visitors quickly going down the other end and making it 3-0. Wolves famously overturned a 3-0 half-time deficit to win 4-3 in the first Premier League meeting between the sides back in October 2003. Victory for Vitor on Premier League bow
Fresh from four successive defeats that culminated in the departure of O’Neil, Wolves would not necessarily have been relishing the prospect of visiting a Premier League ground on which they had never previously won. Yet, within 45 minutes, Pereira had already made Wolves history. Wolves will have been wary heading into the second half, having conceded 40 Premier League goals already this season, with their only clean sheet coming in a win over bottom side Southampton. Following unsavoury endings to their two previous matches, Wolves will hope to see more of this going forward.",Wolves_2024-12-22,leicester-city,vitor-pereira,ruud-van-nistelrooy,3,0,17,2,0,46,1.11,2,8,4,1,16,479,20,15,0,0,4,1,3,1,6,2,1,0,11,2,1,400,8,38,26,0,46,9,37,8,2,20,7,65,22,1,4,0.7936,0,2,5,54,0.8,1,9,1,6,15,546,18,16,2,0,5,0,2,2,7,2,1,3,17,2,1,473,20,66,20,0,54,7,41,11,8,18,9,45,8,0,1,-2.4746,0,0,6
648,648,brentford,2025-01-14,"Manchester City missed the chance to move up in the Premier League table after they let a 2-0 lead slip in Tuesday night's 2-2 draw at Brentford. Phil Foden, who was the hat-trick hero when the sides met at the Gtech Community Stadium last season, struck twice in the second half to put Pep Guardiola’s side on course for a third consecutive Premier League win and fourth in all competitions. However, Brentford refused to lie down and Yoane Wissa pulled a goal back in the 82nd minute to set up a grandstand finish. In the second minute of stoppage time, Christian Norgaard headed in Keane Lewis-Potter’s cross to snatch a share of the spoils for Thomas Frank’s side. Man City sit sixth in the table, having failed to capitalise on Newcastle United not playing until Wednesday, while Brentford moved up to 10th following their dramatic fightback. How the match unfolded
Despite City’s bright start, Brentford went closest to breaking the deadlock, with Stefan Ortega getting down well to push away Bryan Mbeumo’s low drive. Both sides went close after the break - Savinho struck the post following a swift counter, while Josko Gvardiol made a superb last-ditch intervention to deny Wissa. In the 65th minute, Damsgaard was thwarted by the offside flag, and, within 60 seconds, City were in front as Foden brilliantly cushioned Kevin De Bruyne’s fierce cross beyond goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Nathan Ake’s superb goalline block then denied Wissa an immediate response before City doubled their lead. Savinho robbed Mads Roerslev of possession before Flekken parried his fierce strike to Foden, who made no mistake from close range. The Bees halved the deficit as Roerslev kept a deep cross alive by cushioning the ball into the six-yard box for Wissa to neatly tuck beyond Ortega. The hosts also came within inches of winning the game, but Ake cleared Mbeumo’s last-second drive off the line. Wissa landmark strike launches Bees fightback
Brentford found themselves in increasingly unfamiliar territory. Having only recently been unbeaten at the Gtech Community Stadium all season, they welcomed the defending Premier League champions having lost their last three matches in all competitions on home soil. Nevertheless, the Bees more than held their own against Guardiola’s resurgent side, with only a combination of impressive last-ditch City defending and the offside flag denying them the game’s opening goal. Even after falling behind, Frank’s side refused to lie down and continued to generate a decent attacking threat. It eventually culminated in their route back into the contest, with Wissa’s finish his 37th Premier League goal - making him Brentford’s all-time top scorer in the division as he surpassed Ivan Toney. Had it not been for Ake’s impressive blocks, Brentford’s day could have been even better but, with Premier League leaders Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur the next two visitors to the Gtech, the Bees will enter those matches with plenty of momentum. City had not won back-to-back Premier League away matches since August, but quickly settled into their stride against Brentford. However, there was to be a late twist as a couple of slight defensive lapses were ruthlessly pounced upon by the stubborn Bees. Wissa was completely unmarked to drag them back into the contest, while Norgaard stole a march on his marker to head home the equaliser. Club reports

City had not won back-to-back Premier League away matches since August, but quickly settled into their stride against Brentford. After Savinho hit the post early in the second half, City eventually hit the front with Foden discovering the goalscoring touch again on the ground where he bagged three last season. Nevertheless, Guardiola’s side must quickly dust themselves down with Champions League games against Paris Saint-Germain and Club Brugge on the horizon while, in between, Chelsea visit the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League.

Leandro Trossard’s strike four minutes after the equaliser proved the difference between the two sides as the Gunners did the double over Spurs, having won the reverse fixture 1-0 in September. Kai Havertz, Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard all passed up chances to increase the home side’s lead in the second half, meaning they had to survive a nervy finish to secure the victory. Arsenal reclaim second place from Nottingham Forest following the victory, while Spurs are 13th. How the match unfolded
The Gunners were dominant early on, but Spurs scored against the run of play in the 25th minute when captain Son’s side-footed effort from the edge of the box nestled in the back of the net after taking a deflection off William Saliba. Arsenal found a way back through a Rice corner, as Gabriel’s run towards the far post put Radu Dragusin under pressure, with the Arsenal defender's header going in off Solanke in the 40th minute. Trossard then put Mikel Arteta’s side ahead four minutes later as his powerful low drive beat Antonin Kinsky at the end of a quick break. Arsenal’s set-pieces continued to create problems for Spurs, with Havertz heading inches wide in the 53rd minute, while Rice produced a good save from Kinsky later on. Arsenal get statement win
Arteta and Arsenal were desperate for a victory against Spurs, coming into the derby on the back of consecutive cup defeats to Newcastle United and Manchester United. With high-flying Nottingham Forest holding Liverpool to a draw on Tuesday, it was also an opportunity for the Gunners to cut the gap to the leaders and underline their title credentials. Gabriel Jesus became the latest attacker to join Bukayo Saka and Ethan Nwaneri on Arsenal’s injury list this week and his team-mates paid tribute to the  Brazilian with their pre-match shirts.

Isak continued his rich form when he nudged home to put Newcastle ahead in the 38th minute of Saturday’s contest at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs, ravaged by injury and illness, had named their youngest Premier League starting XI (23y, 336d) since March 2015 (23y, 290d). Though Spurs’ defensive issues came back to bite when Gordon swiftly restored parity, just 140 seconds later. While Newcastle consolidated their place in fifth, Ange Postecoglou’s Tottenham remain 11th as they suffered their 10th defeat in the league this season. Solanke got the better of Sven Botman to head in from Pedro Porro’s excellent cross. But Spurs’ lead lasted just 140 seconds, as Gordon slotted in coolly from a tight angle, with the goal confirmed after the VAR checked for handball by Joelinton in the build-up. Brennan Johnson hit the woodwork as Spurs searched for a response after the restart, though Gordon squandered a gilt-edged chance at the other end when he blazed over. Substitute James Maddison curled just wide to spark a frantic conclusion in which Johnson and Sergio Reguilon flashed across the face of goal as an equaliser evaded Spurs. An (Un)happy New Year
Tottenham conceded the first goal in 15 Premier League home games in 2024 and, even though they hit the front this time out, their makeshift defence could not cope with Newcastle’s quality in the final third. But Postecoglou must look at the scenario from which Newcastle’s equaliser came about. Only two minutes after taking the lead, Spurs took an unnecessary risk when playing out from the back, and were made to pay. Dragusin was forced off at half-time as Spurs woes continued to mount, with Djed Spence having to partner Archie Gray in defence. To their credit, Tottenham held their own at the back from then on, but they could not find an equaliser at the other end – Johnson and Maddison going close before multiple cross-shots somehow avoided a glut of players in the box and Solanke headed just over. Postecoglou needs his key players back, though, if Spurs – who face rivals Arsenal in their next league outing – are to get a season that is threatening to slip away completely, back on course.

Tottenham conceded the first goal in 15 Premier League home games in 2024 and, even though they hit the front this time out, their makeshift defence could not cope with Newcastle’s quality in the final third. They were unhappy with the decision to award Newcastle’s opener, with Lucas Bergvall’s pass having struck Joelinton’s arm before Bruno Guimaraes fed Gordon, but it was deemed that the Brazilian’s arm was in a natural position and the contact was accidental. But Postecoglou must look at the scenario from which Newcastle’s equaliser came about. They also had a couple of warning signs prior to Isak putting Newcastle ahead. Gordon tested debutant goalkeeper Brandon Austin – standing in for the ill Fraser Forster – and Murphy found space down the right on multiple occasions before he eventually put in the cross that Dragusin bundled into Isak’s stride. Isak powering Newcastle’s Champions League charge
Howe was able to welcome back defender Botman from injury for his first start of the season, though the Dutchman – who went off with what looked like cramp late on – was caught out when Solanke stole in to open the scoring. Howe will have been delighted with how his team responded to going behind, especially when considering that was the first top-flight goal Newcastle had conceded since their 4-2 loss at Brentford on 7 December. Gordon got things going for the visitors, as he sent a message to the onlooking Tuchel with a superb finish low into the far corner from the left-hand side of the box. Isak, though, is Newcastle’s man of the moment. He showed rare profligacy when he diverted wide in the 32nd minute, but he swiftly atoned with what was his sixth league goal against Spurs. Gordon should probably have supplied a pass for another potential tap-in for Isak in the second half, but lashed over instead. Though Newcastle were not made to pay for that miss as they held on, including through 10 minutes of stoppage time, to apply further pressure to the top four. Club reports

654,654,wolverhampton,2024-12-26,"Manchester United suffered their fourth Premier League defeat in the space of five matches as Bruno Fernandes was sent off in a 2-0 defeat to a resurgent Wolverhampton Wanderers. Fernandes received his marching orders early in the second half at a misty Molineux, where Matheus Cunha bent in directly from a corner just before the hour. Cunha then teed up Hwang Hee-chan to make sure of the points deep in stoppage time. Thursday’s result marks a winning home debut for new Wolves head coach Vitor Pereira, who got one over on his Portuguese compatriot Ruben Amorim. With two wins from two under Pereira, Wolves moved – at least temporarily – into 17th, three places behind out-of-form United. How the match unfolded
An early half-chance for Fernandes aside, Wolves had the better of the first half, and forced Andre Onana into the first meaningful save when he tipped over Jorgen Strand Larsen’s header. Nelson Semedo went close with a deflected long-range effort before half-time, and Wolves received a huge boost less than two minutes into the second half when the full-back was on the end of a rash challenge from Fernandes. Semedo was in the thick of it again moments later as he crossed in for Larsen to head home, but Wolves’ celebrations were cut short by the offside flag – with the VAR confirming that decision. Yet there was no such reprieve for United in the 58th minute, as Cunha curled an inswinging, right-footed corner over the bodies in a crowded box and into the far corner. Cunha raced clear on the break and squared for substitute Hwang, who slammed in his first league goal of the season. Yet that is what happened when Cunha swung his corner into the back of Onana’s net to put Wolves ahead, just a week after Son Heung-min had done the same for Tottenham Hotspur, in United’s defeat to Ange Postecoglou’s team in the EFL Cup. Fernandes pled his innocence, but he left his right boot in on Semedo when he stretched to meet a loose touch on the edge of Wolves’ box, giving referee Tony Harrington little choice but to hand him a second yellow card. Shorn of their playmaker, United surrendered territory to Wolves, and then lacked the cutting edge to respond after falling behind, with hopeful headers from Alejandro Garnacho and Harry Maguire the best they managed. United might have been handed a lifeline prior to Wolves’ second goal, when the VAR checked for a possible foul in the hosts’ box, but no on-field review was required as the Red Devils’ dismal run of form rolled on, with daunting fixtures against Newcastle United and Liverpool coming up. Pereira’s perfect start
Two wins and two clean sheets from his opening two Premier League matches is all that Pereira could have hoped for after taking charge at Molineux, where the doom and gloom that was present at the end of Gary O’Neil’s tenure has well and truly lifted. Their win owed much to Cunha. Cunha then capped off a superb individual display with that assist for Hwang, meaning he has now been involved in 11 goals in his last 10 league matches, and Pereira will know that ensuring the former Atletico Madrid attacker keeps up that kind of form, while ensuring Wolves stay tight at the back, could be the key to dragging his new team away from danger. There is, however, the lingering issue of a potential ban for Cunha, who faces an FA charge after his actions in the wake of Wolves’ loss to Ipswich Town.",Wolves_2024-12-26,manchester-united,vitor-pereira,ruben-amorim,2,0,18,1,1,51,0.86,1,7,4,4,12,474,26,12,2,0,4,0,1,2,3,4,0,0,14,1,3,394,18,53,32,0,56,18,47,16,9,26,14,58,21,0,4,1.0594,1,1,6,49,0.44,0,11,2,4,12,457,24,12,4,1,4,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,20,4,1,366,19,64,17,0,44,12,40,9,4,24,13,53,21,0,2,-0.3539,1,0,6
655,655,manchester-united,2024-12-26,"Manchester United suffered their fourth Premier League defeat in the space of five matches as Bruno Fernandes was sent off in a 2-0 defeat to a resurgent Wolverhampton Wanderers. Fernandes received his marching orders early in the second half at a misty Molineux, where Matheus Cunha bent in directly from a corner just before the hour. With two wins from two under Pereira, Wolves moved – at least temporarily – into 17th, three places behind out-of-form United. How the match unfolded
An early half-chance for Fernandes aside, Wolves had the better of the first half, and forced Andre Onana into the first meaningful save when he tipped over Jorgen Strand Larsen’s header. Nelson Semedo went close with a deflected long-range effort before half-time, and Wolves received a huge boost less than two minutes into the second half when the full-back was on the end of a rash challenge from Fernandes. United’s captain picked up his second booking, with VAR upholding the referee’s call. Yet there was no such reprieve for United in the 58th minute, as Cunha curled an inswinging, right-footed corner over the bodies in a crowded box and into the far corner. Yet that is what happened when Cunha swung his corner into the back of Onana’s net to put Wolves ahead, just a week after Son Heung-min had done the same for Tottenham Hotspur, in United’s defeat to Ange Postecoglou’s team in the EFL Cup. His team’s vulnerability from set-pieces will be of real concern for Amorim, as will their reaction after the dismissal of their captain Fernandes. Fernandes pled his innocence, but he left his right boot in on Semedo when he stretched to meet a loose touch on the edge of Wolves’ box, giving referee Tony Harrington little choice but to hand him a second yellow card. Shorn of their playmaker, United surrendered territory to Wolves, and then lacked the cutting edge to respond after falling behind, with hopeful headers from Alejandro Garnacho and Harry Maguire the best they managed. United might have been handed a lifeline prior to Wolves’ second goal, when the VAR checked for a possible foul in the hosts’ box, but no on-field review was required as the Red Devils’ dismal run of form rolled on, with daunting fixtures against Newcastle United and Liverpool coming up.",Man Utd_2024-12-26,wolverhampton,ruben-amorim,vitor-pereira,0,2,18,1,0,49,0.44,0,11,2,4,12,457,24,12,4,1,4,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,20,4,1,366,19,64,17,0,44,12,40,9,4,24,13,53,21,0,2,-0.3539,1,0,6,51,0.86,1,7,4,4,12,474,26,12,2,0,4,0,1,2,3,4,0,0,14,1,3,394,18,53,32,0,56,18,47,16,9,26,14,58,21,0,4,1.0594,1,1,6
656,656,chelsea,2024-12-26,"Substitute Rodrigo Muniz scored a dramatic 95th-minute winner as Fulham registered their first league win at Stamford Bridge since October 1979 with a 2-1 victory over Chelsea. Wales international Wilson levelled with a close-range header in the 82nd minute before Muniz secured the points, his cool finish into the bottom corner deep into stoppage time giving Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez no chance. Before Fulham's late double it had looked like Cole Palmer’s outstanding solo effort in the 16th minute was going to be enough, but Chelsea instead suffered their first league defeat since 20 October, and only their third of the season so far. Enzo Maresca's side missed the chance to move within one point of leaders Liverpool, and now trail Arne Slot’s men by seven points following their 3-1 win against Leicester City on Boxing Day. How the match unfolded
Palmer opened up the game out of nowhere in the early stages, spinning away from two Fulham players before nonchalantly dispatching a finish into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Marc Cucurella should have doubled Chelsea’s lead after 35 minutes when he peeled away at the far post on a free-kick, but his diving header was straight at Bernd Leno. The Fulham goalkeeper superbly denied Enzo Fernandez with a fingertip save shortly after the break, and although Levi Colwill nodded in from the edge of the six-yard box on the resulting corner, he had strayed offside. Palmer’s brilliance not enough
Chelsea missed the chance to go temporarily top of the Premier League last weekend after their 0-0 draw at Everton, and the Blues have lost further ground on Liverpool with their first loss since their trip to Anfield two months ago. It looked like they were set to return to winning ways, especially in the first half with Palmer leading from the front. Chelsea had barely had a sniff before his goal, but the England international simply shrugged off Andreas Pereira and Lukic with a clever turn before picking out the bottom corner with a brilliant shot that resembled a pass. Palmer was a constant threat for Chelsea before the break and arguably could have doubled his tally on the stroke of half-time after being slid in by Fernandez, but Bassey took it off his toe with an exceptional block. However, Chelsea failed to get him in the game as much in the second half and Fulham upped the pressure. Palmer still had his moments - his brilliant cross set up Colwill for the disallowed goal - but his influence diminished. With their main threat more subdued, Chelsea's pressure started to show. After Wilson’s goal, the hosts committed too many bodies forward in search of a winner and Muniz profited from the space to dampen the festive mood at Stamford Bridge. Given their track record, a trip to Stamford Bridge - where Fulham had never won in the Premier League - would not have had many away fans hopeful of enjoying some festive cheer, and it looked like that poor run would continue to haunt them. Silva’s men started well in the opening 15 minutes, especially after changing shape to a back five, and they would have felt unlucky to be undone by individual brilliance from Palmer. They responded well, with Jimenez and Bassey both unlucky not to get on the scoresheet in the first half, and Fulham stayed brave throughout the contest, unwilling to let up on Chelsea’s backline no matter what. Sanchez had initially proved his worth for Chelsea with some key stops, but he was helpless against Wilson and Muniz’s late goals and Silva will be keen to kick on from another impressive away day against AFC Bournemouth next time out.

Marco Silva’s late changes paid off in spectacular fashion on Boxing Day, with Muniz and Harry Wilson both coming off the bench to engineer an impressive turnaround win. Wales international Wilson levelled with a close-range header in the 82nd minute before Muniz secured the points, his cool finish into the bottom corner deep into stoppage time giving Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez no chance.

Fulham, meanwhile, move up to eighth, just one point behind Newcastle United in fifth as part of a keenly contested top half of the table. How the match unfolded
Palmer opened up the game out of nowhere in the early stages, spinning away from two Fulham players before nonchalantly dispatching a finish into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Fulham fought back as Raul Jimenez burst down the right before dragging an effort wide, while Calvin Bassey drove down the opposite flank, but Robert Sanchez held his shot. Marc Cucurella should have doubled Chelsea’s lead after 35 minutes when he peeled away at the far post on a free-kick, but his diving header was straight at Bernd Leno. The Fulham goalkeeper superbly denied Enzo Fernandez with a fingertip save shortly after the break, and although Levi Colwill nodded in from the edge of the six-yard box on the resulting corner, he had strayed offside. Having sent a looping shot wide shortly after his introduction, substitute Wilson made no mistake with his next opportunity, losing his marker to nod in at the far post after Timothy Castagne had headed across the face of goal. Chelsea had barely had a sniff before his goal, but the England international simply shrugged off Andreas Pereira and Lukic with a clever turn before picking out the bottom corner with a brilliant shot that resembled a pass. However, Chelsea failed to get him in the game as much in the second half and Fulham upped the pressure. After Wilson’s goal, the hosts committed too many bodies forward in search of a winner and Muniz profited from the space to dampen the festive mood at Stamford Bridge. The perfect present
Fulham would now have the top four in their sights had they not dropped points against Southampton before Christmas, but their European hopes are very much alive after another late show. Given their track record, a trip to Stamford Bridge - where Fulham had never won in the Premier League - would not have had many away fans hopeful of enjoying some festive cheer, and it looked like that poor run would continue to haunt them.

Southampton had the better of the chances in the first half despite a bright West Ham start, with Paul Onuachu guilty of missing a host of opportunities and West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski making a number of crucial saves before he was forced off with a serious-looking head injury after a collision with Nathan Wood. Onuachu and Tyler Dibling passed up presentable chances late on as West Ham made it four league games unbeaten and moved above Manchester United into 13th, while Southampton remain bottom. Fernandes dragged wide, Dibling sliced over and Onuachu headed off-target as Southampton searched for an equaliser that did not arrive. Positive signs for Juric, but no points
The new Southampton boss will have been pleased with many elements of his side’s first half display, but ultimately they lacked the finishing touch. Both Yukinari Sugawara and Walker-Peters offered width and attacking intent, with Southampton finding plenty of joy down the flanks. As it stands, the situation looks bleak for Southampton, who are six points behind 19th -place Ipswich Town. Juric will look to take the positives, but if he is to drag Southampton to safety, they need to take points, and quickly. Club reports

The deadlock was broken just before the hour – Bowen poking home from close range after latching onto Niclas Fullkrug’s flick-on. Onuachu and Tyler Dibling passed up presentable chances late on as West Ham made it four league games unbeaten and moved above Manchester United into 13th, while Southampton remain bottom. Fabianski thwarted Mateus Fernandes and Onuachu, but he had to be taken off on a stretcher after a collision with Wood from a corner, and his replacement Alphonse Areola saved well from another gilt-edged Onuachu chance on the stroke of half-time. Rodriguez seemed to have received his marching orders when he went in on Walker-Peters, but West Ham received a lifeline after the VAR recommended an on-field review. West Ham made their luck count in the 59th minute, with Bowen poking in from Fullkrug’s header. Juric will know that missed chances on a regular basis will prove costly at this level, and that came to pass, with Bowen’s goal coming at a time when the home side had been the better team. Hammers getting it together
Julen Lopetegui has been under pressure at various points already this season, but that is now four matches unbeaten for the Hammers, who are only five points behind seventh-place Manchester City. Though they could have taken the lead early on through Soler, West Ham were second best for large parts of the first 45, with Bowen posing the greatest threat. Bowen stole a march on his marker to meet Fullkrug’s flick-on from Tomas Soucek’s header into the area, and duly turned in a neat finish.

Andrew Robertson and Mohamed Salah both struck the woodwork before Liverpool finally broke through with an outstanding strike from Cody Gakpo, and it was one-way traffic from then on. Curtis Jones put the Reds 2-1 up early in the second half, and Salah scored his 100th home Premier League goal to end the contest in the 82nd minute. Liverpool's lead at the summit could be cut to six points when Arsenal host Ipswich Town on Friday, while Leicester are 18th, one point behind Wolverhampton Wanderers, following Vitor Pereira's side's win over Manchester United. How the match unfolded
After surviving one early goalmouth scramble, Leicester stunned the Anfield crowd when Ayew swivelled on Stephy Mavididi's cross and squeezed a finish inside the near post. Liverpool immediately laid siege to the Leicester area and twice hit the frame of the goal. Robertson headed Trent Alexander-Arnold's delivery against the foot of the post, then Salah curled a shot against the crossbar. Darwin Nunez side-footed over early in the second half but Liverpool doubled their advantage in the 49th minute, Jones tapping home from Alexis Mac Allister's cross, with the goal confirmed following a VAR check for offside. Gakpo was frustrated by the flag when lashing home for what appeared to be Liverpool's third in the 68th minute, with a lengthy VAR check confirming the on-field decision to disallow his strike due to Nunez being offside in the build-up. But the Reds would not be denied a two-goal cushion, with Salah driving forward and stroking into the bottom-left corner. Leaders dig deep
Liverpool capitalised on a slip-up from Chelsea last Sunday, tearing Tottenham Hotspur apart in a 6-3 victory after their nearest title rivals were held to a goalless draw by Everton. Arne Slot made a pair of changes in advanced areas as Jones and Nunez replaced Dominik Szoboszlai and Luis Diaz, both of whom were on target at Spurs. It initially appeared that his tinkering may backfire, with the Reds producing a flat display in front of a frustrated crowd. However, Gakpo's moment of magic in first-half stoppage time was the turning point, with Liverpool utterly dominant from then on. Having been quiet by his usual standards in the first half, Salah was influential in the second, playing Mac Allister into the area in the build-up to Jones' goal and then applying his own unerring finish to net the home side's third. It brought up Salah's 100th Premier League goal at home, with 98 of those coming for Liverpool and two for Chelsea. Slot's men now prepare to face West Ham in their final league game of 2024. Will 2025 bring their second Premier League crown?

Having seen their team dismantled in back-to-back defeats versus Newcastle United and Wolverhampton Wanderers, shipping seven goals without reply, Leicester's travelling fans had cause for concern as they arrived at Anfield. Their tensions may have been heightened ahead of kick-off, with Wolves' earlier win dropping the Foxes into the bottom three, while Jamie Vardy was ruled out after sustaining an injury in training. Mavididi showed good pace to escape down the left and awareness to find the feet of Ayew, who left Robertson reeling with a swivel of his hips before finishing into the bottom-left corner. Leicester then defended stoically, only to be undone by a moment of brilliance, with Polish goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk, making his Premier League debut, left clawing at thin air when Gakpo sent a magnificent effort dipping into the far corner. Having conceded mere seconds before the half-time whistle, Leicester looked shorn of confidence after the restart and Liverpool ultimately cruised to victory, despite being far from their best. Worryingly for the Foxes, they now have the league's joint-worst defensive record this season, matching Wolves' 40 goals conceded. With their relegation rivals starting to gain form, Leicester need to find a way to solve that problem, with Manchester City next up. Club reports

662,662,newcastle-united,2024-12-26,"Newcastle United beat Aston Villa's 10 men in a feisty Boxing Day encounter at St James' Park, with Anthony Gordon, Alexander Isak and Joelinton all scoring in a comprehensive 3-0 home win. Gordon netted with a stunning effort just 80 seconds into the match, before in-form striker Isak and returning midfielder Joelinton put Newcastle out of sight in the second half. Newcastle's assistant manager Jason Tindall was also shown a red card as tensions boiled over at half-time, but the Magpies kept their cool on the pitch and could have won by a greater margin, with Isak, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes all having goals correctly disallowed and Jacob Murphy hitting the crossbar. A third straight Premier League win moves Eddie Howe’s team into fifth place with 29 points, as Villa slip to ninth. How the match unfolded
Newcastle scored from the match's first attack, Gordon bending an unstoppable effort into the top-right corner after being fed by Joelinton. Joelinton had a strike chalked off due to Isak carrying the ball out of play, then Emiliano Martinez made a miraculous save to deny Sandro Tonali just before half-time. However, there was nothing Martinez could do when Newcastle went 2-0 up in the 59th minute, Isak tapping Murphy's cross home from six yards out. Isak was offside when finishing emphatically from another Murphy pass moments later, before Murphy somehow rattled the crossbar with the goal gaping. Newcastle's third goal was delayed when Ezri Konsa's clearance deflected in off Guimaraes but was disallowed for handball after a VAR review, but Joelinton eventually made it 3-0 with a curling effort in stoppage time. Goals galore for Magpies
Speaking after last Saturday's 4-0 dismantling of Ipswich Town, which came one week after Leicester City were trounced by the same scoreline, Howe said Newcastle's attackers were back to their best after enduring a difficult start to the season. Gordon, who should arguably have had a couple of goals at Portman Road last time out, wasted no time in getting on the scoresheet here, giving Martinez no chance with a wonderful curling effort from the left corner of the box. The match became stretched from there, with Lucas Digne and Schar working the goalkeepers with strong free-kick efforts, but when Duran's moment of madness gave Newcastle a numerical advantage, they made it count. Isak and Murphy combined brilliantly to put Ipswich to the sword last time out, and their latest link-up means Isak has scored in five straight Premier League matches (seven goals in total), with Murphy assisting four in his last four. Only a marginal offside call denied Isak his brace as he blasted into an unguarded net following fine footwork from Murphy. But this Newcastle team now appears full of goals, and Joelinton – reinstated by Howe after serving a one-match suspension – capped another rampant attacking display by bending home the final goal one minute into stoppage time. Having scored 11 goals without reply in their last three league matches, Newcastle are ending 2024 on a high. However, Duran – who often uses his physicality and aggression to unsettle opponents – was on the wrong side of the line at St James' Park, receiving a belated (and unwanted) Christmas card.",Newcastle_2024-12-26,aston-villa,eddie-howe,unai-emery,3,0,18,1,1,63,2.76,3,22,1,9,15,550,11,10,2,0,8,1,7,7,16,6,2,1,49,2,5,504,7,56,23,0,47,13,27,14,6,11,8,54,19,0,1,0.182,0,1,3,37,0.34,0,4,4,6,10,316,15,15,1,1,1,0,2,1,2,2,0,0,9,3,3,254,11,34,14,0,53,7,39,8,10,15,5,42,18,3,4,0.3117,2,2,10

Villa played the majority of the match with 10 men after Jhon Duran was sent off for violent conduct midway through the first half, having aimed a needless kick at Fabian Schar. A third straight Premier League win moves Eddie Howe’s team into fifth place with 29 points, as Villa slip to ninth. Matters got worse for Villa when Duran left his foot in on Schar in the 32nd minute, with Anthony Taylor brandishing a straight red card and VAR confirming the referee’s decision. Joelinton had a strike chalked off due to Isak carrying the ball out of play, then Emiliano Martinez made a miraculous save to deny Sandro Tonali just before half-time. However, there was nothing Martinez could do when Newcastle went 2-0 up in the 59th minute, Isak tapping Murphy's cross home from six yards out. Newcastle's third goal was delayed when Ezri Konsa's clearance deflected in off Guimaraes but was disallowed for handball after a VAR review, but Joelinton eventually made it 3-0 with a curling effort in stoppage time. Gordon, who should arguably have had a couple of goals at Portman Road last time out, wasted no time in getting on the scoresheet here, giving Martinez no chance with a wonderful curling effort from the left corner of the box. The in-form winger only had himself to blame, though, when he crashed against the crossbar with Martinez grounded mere moments later. Duran gets unwelcome Christmas card
Duran finally looked to have established himself as a regular starter for Villa, scoring 12 goals in all competitions this season – seven of them in the league – to displace Ollie Watkins up front. Indeed, Thursday's match was the fourth in a row in which Villa left Watkins out of their starting line-up in the Premier League, the first time that has happened since he arrived from Brentford back in 2020. Villa always faced an uphill task from there, though they almost forced a nervy finish when Pau Torres headed just over at 2-0 down, seconds after Murphy had nearly put through his own net. Things do not get much easier for Unai Emery's men on 30 December, as they face another top-ten side - Brighton and Hove Albion - in their final match before the turn of the year.",Aston Villa_2024-12-26,newcastle-united,unai-emery,eddie-howe,0,3,18,1,0,37,0.34,0,4,4,6,10,316,15,15,1,1,1,0,2,1,2,2,0,0,9,3,3,254,11,34,14,0,53,7,39,8,10,15,5,42,18,3,4,0.3117,2,2,10,63,2.76,3,22,1,9,15,550,11,10,2,0,8,1,7,7,16,6,2,1,49,2,5,504,7,56,23,0,47,13,27,14,6,11,8,54,19,0,1,0.182,0,1,3
664,664,nottingham-forest,2024-12-26,"Anthony Elanga scored for the third Premier League match in a row to move Nottingham Forest up to third as they beat Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 at the City Ground. Elanga, who had scored in wins over Aston Villa and Brentford, put the hosts into a 28th-minute lead after being brilliantly picked out by Morgan Gibbs-White, before prodding the ball home. Spurs rarely threatened Matz Sels throughout the contest, with the returning Brennan Johnson unable to find a way past the Forest goalkeeper with his three efforts on target. It was also an unhappy return for former Forest defender Djed Spence, who was given a second yellow card late on to hand Ange Postecoglou another defensive issue, having seen Radu Dragusin go off injured moments earlier. The win lifts Forest above Arsenal and into third ahead of the Gunners’ home encounter with Ipswich Town on Friday, while Spurs stay in 11th, 10 points off the top four. How the match unfolded
Son Heung-min was the first to test Sels in the opening exchanges following Murillo’s poor giveaway, before Callum Hudson-Odoi curled over after a quick Forest counter-attack. But the hosts would get themselves in front soon after when Gibbs-White’s pass in behind was poked home by Elanga. Johnson then saw his effort tipped over the bar by Sels shortly before the break after Dejan Kulusevski had done brilliantly to pick out the Welshman in the Forest box. Johnson continued to threaten after the break, brilliantly touching the ball beyond Murillo but was again met by Sels, with Elanga going close to doubling his tally but miscuing his effort. Fraser Forster then denied Gibbs-White from close range after parrying Elliot Anderson’s cross away, before Spence was handed his marching orders in second-half stoppage time for a mistimed tackle on Jota Silva. Forest advance on Europe
Nuno Espirito Santo continues to play down Forest’s chances of reaching European football next season, but he is building something special at the City Ground this campaign, something he was unable to do during his short tenure with Spurs three years ago. After a slow start, which saw Ryan Yates booked for a foul on Son, meaning he will miss Forest’s trip to Goodison Park to face Everton on Sunday, they eventually found their groove when Elanga tucked home his third Premier League goal in as many matches in the competition. Forest continued to impress at both ends of the pitch, with Sels producing some important stops to deny Johnson, as Forster tipped away Anderson’s cross into the box before springing back to his feet to save from Gibbs-White. Though Spurs dominated possession, they were unable to carve out any meaningful chances, though Forest could have doubled their advantage late on when substitute Taiwo Awoniyi fired into the side-netting from a tight angle, despite having better options around him. Forest will be hoping to continue their impressive form but face a tough test against Everton at Goodison Park this Sunday, with the Toffees having held Manchester City 1-1 on Boxing Day. Spurs remain without Guglielmo Vicario, Richarlison, Ben Davies, Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, but started strong at the City Ground when Son tested Sels before Johnson stung the palms of the Forest goalkeeper moments later. But Elanga’s opener seemingly clicked Forest’s slick football into gear, though Johnson was again thwarted by Sels before Son closed out the first half by sending a free-kick into the side-netting, and that effort was arguably the closest Spurs came to getting themselves level. James Maddison was introduced from the bench but was unable to find the target, and amid Spurs’ pressure, they were unable to penetrate Forest's goal.",Nott'm Forest_2024-12-26,tottenham-hotspur,nuno-espirito-santo,ange-postecoglou,1,0,18,1,1,30,1.12,2,10,4,2,12,261,21,13,3,0,3,0,5,2,7,3,1,1,18,2,4,191,12,39,19,0,54,7,43,12,9,21,10,50,32,0,4,0.9263,1,1,9,70,0.9,1,13,2,7,13,620,11,12,4,1,4,0,4,5,7,6,1,0,30,5,1,545,18,77,9,0,46,11,33,13,10,11,7,55,3,1,2,0.3601,0,0,7

Spurs’ defensive woes continue
Following their defeat against Liverpool last time out, Postecoglou believed he was being unfairly judged given his side’s long list of injuries, but his position will only be put further under the microscope after falling to defeat here. Spurs remain without Guglielmo Vicario, Richarlison, Ben Davies, Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, but started strong at the City Ground when Son tested Sels before Johnson stung the palms of the Forest goalkeeper moments later. But Elanga’s opener seemingly clicked Forest’s slick football into gear, though Johnson was again thwarted by Sels before Son closed out the first half by sending a free-kick into the side-netting, and that effort was arguably the closest Spurs came to getting themselves level. James Maddison was introduced from the bench but was unable to find the target, and amid Spurs’ pressure, they were unable to penetrate Forest's goal. Postecoglou will have to do plenty of thinking on how to solve Spurs’ defensive issues ahead of facing Wolverhampton Wanderers at home on Sunday. Club reports
