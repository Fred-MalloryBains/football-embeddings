      "{'Bournemouth': 'Rasmus Hojlund\\'s stoppage-time strike salvaged a point for Manchester United as they drew 1-1 with 10-man AFC Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Sunday. Antoine Semenyo’s 23rd-minute goal had put the Cherries ahead before Evanilson received a red card following a VAR review in the 70th minute, having lunged in on Noussair Mazraoui. The draw sees Bournemouth stay 10th, missing the chance to go eighth in the table, while Ruben Amorim’s visitors climb to 14th. How the match unfolded\\nBournemouth deservedly went ahead after winning the ball high up the pitch midway through the first half, with Evanilson’s neat flick powered home by Semenyo at Andre Onana’s near post. United improved as the half went on and came close to an equaliser, but Kepa Arrizabalaga tipped Alejandro\\xa0Garnacho’s chipped effort behind after confusion in the Cherries\\' defence. But the Cherries were forced to play the final 20 minutes, plus stoppage time, without Evanilson after the Brazilian was sent off for a two-footed challenge on Mazraoui. Sour taste for Cherries\\nBournemouth have never finished higher than ninth in the Premier League, doing so under Eddie Howe in 2016/17, but they had an opportunity to climb back above Fulham into eighth – a position that could bring UEFA Conference League qualification. The Cherries showcased their attacking intent from the off, with Ouattara’s teasing delivery narrowly evading Evanilson on the slide inside the opening three minutes, while Justin\\xa0Kluivert went close from distance. But just as the Cherries looked to kill the game off, Evanilson was given his marching orders. Bournemouth defended stoutly from then on but were undone by Hojlund, with his last-gasp leveller a potentially huge blow for Andoni Iraola\\'s men. The visitors were caught napping from the free-kick that followed that foul, with their intent on playing out from the back punished by Bournemouth’s high press. Bournemouth continued to boss proceedings after the break, before Evanilson\\'s red card turned the tide.

      "{'Chelsea': \"Nicolas Jackson's first goal in 13 Premier League matches provided a major boost to Chelsea's UEFA Champions League qualification hopes as they beat Everton 1-0 at Stamford Bridge. Jackson fired home from just outside the area in the 27th minute, with this the first of his 24 Premier League goal since joining Chelsea to come from outside the box, as the Blues took advantage of Manchester City, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa being in FA Cup action this weekend. Jackson also had a potential second disallowed for offside late on, as Enzo Maresca's hosts claimed back-to-back Premier League wins. The result takes Chelsea fifth, one point behind City and above Forest on goal difference. How the match unfolded\\nChelsea monopolised possession early on but needed 15 minutes to test Jordan Pickford, with the England goalkeeper tipping Noni Madueke's drive around his left post. Marc Cucurella failed to punish a wayward punch from Pickford when he volleyed wide in the 26th minute, but Chelsea did hit the front 51 seconds later. After Beto lost possession just inside his own half, Jackson turned on Enzo Fernandez's pass and picked out the bottom-left corner with a wonderful finish from 20 yards out. In the second half, Nathan Patterson's poor header forced Pickford to block at Jackson's feet, but Everton finally threatened through Beto, who drew a good stop from Sanchez. Jackson was then flagged offside when tapping home on the rebound from a Cucurella effort, and Everton almost snatched a point through McNeil, only for Sanchez to make a glorious save from his effort in the 87th minute. Heroes at both ends for Chelsea\\nBefore Saturday, Jackson's most recent goal was the winner in a 2-1 derby victory over Brentford on 15 December, with a lack of fitness and form frustrating him since the turn of the year. But Maresca has continued to show faith in the Senegal international, insisting upon his return from a hamstring injury that Chelsea are a better team with him leading the line. Jackson had plenty to do when receiving Fernandez's pass with his back to goal, but a neat turn set him up for a pinpoint finish beyond Pickford's grasp. With Cole Palmer struggling for form, it has often felt like Chelsea have missed a focal point in attack. Jackson provided exactly that, linking the play well and leading the Blues' press admirably. And the Blues had another hero at the other end in the form of Sanchez. Everton felt he was fortunate to escape unpunished from a first-half collision with Vitalii Mykolenko, but his reflex save from McNeil was just as valuable as Jackson's goal. Arguably tasked with the most challenging run-in of all the top-five contenders, Chelsea knew the importance of a win here. Depleted Everton fall short\\nEverton suffered a blow this week when James Tarkowski – who had started 111 consecutive Premier League matches dating back to his time with Burnley – was ruled out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury. O'Brien acquitted himself well enough, but Patterson had a more difficult time against the lively Madueke, and if not for some proactive sweeper-keeping from Pickford, his weak header back might have gifted Jackson a second goal early in the second half. However, it was Beto, the other player brought into Everton's line-up due to Armando Broja being ineligible, that played a part in Chelsea's goal. Everton wanted a spot-kick when Sanchez collided with Mykolenko in the 39th minute, but they struggled in attack until the dying stages, when they found Chelsea's goalkeeper in inspired form.

After Yasin Ayari had given Brighton an early lead on Saturday, Mohammed Kudus and Tomas Soucek turned the game on its head in the second half, and the Hammers led 2-1 after 88 minutes. However, Kaoru Mitoma then equalised, and Baleba sent the home fans into raptures with his stunning stoppage-time strike, leaving former Brighton boss Graham Potter scratching his head on the sidelines. Brighton move up to ninth, while West Ham stay 17th, now safe from relegation after Ipswich Town's defeat to Newcastle ensured the Tractor Boys will complete the bottom three. How the match unfolded\\nIt took just 13 minutes for Brighton to find the opener. Simon Adingra saw a second Brighton goal disallowed in the 36th minute. Bowen was the provider again as he teed up Soucek to nod past Verbruggen in the 83rd minute, but the lead only lased for six minutes as Mitoma nodded in from close range. And Brighton ensured the spoils were theirs when Baleba bent home a sublime long-range strike in the 92nd minute. Brighton stay in the race for Europe\\nBrighton’s 4-2 defeat to Brentford last time out looked to have dented their chances of claiming a European spot this season, but the Seagulls have reignited those hopes. AFC Bournemouth are not in action until Sunday, but with Fulham also beating Southampton, Brighton kept pace in the hunt for Europe, avoiding what could have been a costly slip-up. And even when West Ham grabbed the initiative in the second half, Brighton always posed a threat – Wieffer seeing a header kept out before Hinshelwood’s strike was deflected over. The resilience Brighton showed after Soucek’s header will delight Fabian Hurzeler, and that never-say-die attitude will be required in the run-in. They showed signs of promise in the first half, with Soucek their standout performer – he turned Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s cross into the side netting from a tight angle before almost catching Verbruggen out with a looping header, with Brighton only saved by the bar. Soucek thought he had snatched West Ham’s first win since 27 February, but their shaky defence could not stand up against Brighton’s late pressure.

Brighton move up to ninth, while West Ham stay 17th, now safe from relegation after Ipswich Town's defeat to Newcastle ensured the Tractor Boys will complete the bottom three. West Ham went close to a response as Soucek headed Maximilian Kilman’s cross onto the crossbar, with Bart Verbruggen getting fingertips to it. Alphonse Areola had made a double save to deny Pervis Estupinan and Mats Wieffer before the winger rifled in, but it was adjudged that Danny Welbeck had interfered with the initial effort from an offside position. West Ham drew level three minutes into the second half, with Jarrod Bowen crossing to Kudus, who shot through Verbruggen’s legs. Bowen was the provider again as he teed up Soucek to nod past Verbruggen in the 83rd minute, but the lead only lased for six minutes as Mitoma nodded in from close range. They started well, with Ayari’s stunning finish giving Areola no chance, but they failed to take control for large parts of the game. Only the slightest of margins denied them a second goal, though – Welbeck was inches past the last man when he tried to help on Estupinan’s strike, with Areola making two smart stops before Adingra’s strike was ruled out.

Potter makes unhappy return\\nWest Ham knew they needed a point, or an Ipswich defeat, to confirm their Premier League status, even if they had likely been confident of it for a good while. Niclas Fullkrug’s second-half introduction helped, giving West Ham a focal point, and his movement in the six-yard box opened up the space for Kudus to meet Bowen’s cross.

Ben Johnson was sent off after receiving two first-half bookings – the first for simulation – to give Ipswich a gargantuan task, and Newcastle made their numerical advantage count. While Ipswich will join Southampton and Leicester City in the Championship next season, Eddie Howe enjoyed a triumphant return to the St James' Park dugout after recovering from pneumonia. Ipswich remain 18th in the table, with this defeat ending any mathematical chance of catching West Ham United. After wasting two decent chances, Isak played a key role in Ipswich going down to 10 men in the 37th minute, as Johnson dragged him down while on a booking. Ipswich were penned back for the rest of the half, with Luke Woolfenden heading Guimaraes' overhead kick off the line before Sandro Tonali rattled the crossbar from distance. But Ipswich could not make it to half-time without conceding as Julio Enciso pulled Jacob Murphy back inside the area, with Isak converting after a VAR review saw the penalty awarded. Rather than overplay with the extra man, Newcastle upped the tempo considerably and made Ipswich defend a barrage of crosses. That relentless pressure told when a quickly taken corner led to the penalty incident, and rather than sit on their lead, Newcastle continued to force Ipswich back and got a second through EFL Cup final hero Burn. Mistakes cost relegated Ipswich\\nIpswich entered this game knowing only an improbable victory on Tyneside – coupled with Brighton beating West Ham – would stave off relegation, at least for another week. With Brighton keeping up their end of the bargain, ultimately beating the Hammers 3-2, Ipswich briefly had hope of prolonging the fight. But competing in the Premier League means keeping mistakes to a minimum, and some poor decision-making from Johnson and Enciso cost Kieran McKenna's men. With Ipswich enjoying a decent spell, Johnson threw himself over Burn's outstretched leg and received his first booking, and less than seven minutes later, he was trudging to the changing rooms after making the senseless choice to drag Isak down. Ipswich were never likely to fight back from that position, and their defeat means all three relegation places have been confirmed with as many as four games remaining for the first time in Premier League history. With matches against Everton, Brentford, Leicester and West Ham remaining, Ipswich will now hope to build some positivity ahead of a potential promotion push in 2025/26.

Southampton in 20th, looked primed to surpass the record-low Premier League points tally of 11 they share with the Derby County team of 2007/08 thanks to an early goal from Jack Stephens. But against the run of play, Southampton struck two minutes later when Stephens flicked in Ryan Manning’s set-piece, leaving Bernd Leno rooted to the spot.

The Brazilian scored and provided two assists as the resurgent hosts extended their record streak of successes in the competition at Molineux, where Jamie Vardy's second-half penalty was denied. Cunha broke the deadlock with a close-range finish for his 15th league goal of the season for Wolves, who secured their top-flight status after last weekend's 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. The Brazilian then turned provider after the break for Jorgen Strand Larsen and Rodrigo Gomes to condemn the Foxes to a 10th defeat in 11 games. How the match unfolded\\nWolves carried the greater attacking threat from the off. Cunha was marginally off target from distance, while he also shot straight at Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Although, the Algerian played a key role as Wolves broke the deadlock in the 33rd minute, with his fizzing low ball across the six-yard box turned in by Cunha. Strand Larsen should have doubled the hosts’ lead when he fired over from two yards out, but the Wolves striker was not to be denied in the 56th minute; receiving a well-timed pass from Cunha and slotting past Hermansen. Leicester were given a lifeline in the 70th minute when Jose Sa felled Vardy in the box, but the Wolves goalkeeper atoned for his error by guessing correctly to deny Leicester's captain. The hosts had the final word five minutes from time, with substitute Gomes’ neat finish from a Cunha pass rounding off a swift counter and sealing the victory. Six in a row for Wolves\\nTo say Wolves are currently riding the crest of a wave would be an understatement. After sounding out several warnings, Wolves finally broke the deadlock with Cunha in the right place at the right time to direct Ait-Nouri's cross home. Strand Larsen, who was off target from close range on two separate occasions, was third time lucky with a neat finish from Cunha's through-ball that was ultimately enough to put the game beyond Leicester. Wolves face reigning Premier League champions Manchester City next Friday and will travel to the Etihad Stadium full of confidence as they aim to maintain their strong finish to the campaign. However, Ruud van Nistelrooy will have known it would be difficult to do that against a Wolves side brimming with confidence. The Foxes failed to heed their early warnings and were eventually punished as Cunha struck from close range. Bilal El Khannouss went close from distance in the 55th minute but, within 60 seconds, the visitors were 2-0 down as Wolves cut through the defence courtesy of Cunha and Strand Larsen.

The Brazilian scored and provided two assists as the resurgent hosts extended their record streak of successes in the competition at Molineux, where Jamie Vardy's second-half penalty was denied. The Brazilian then turned provider after the break for Jorgen Strand Larsen and Rodrigo Gomes to condemn the Foxes to a 10th defeat in 11 games. Vitor Pereira's side climb above Everton and Manchester United, who play AFC Bournemouth on Sunday, to 13th place, while Leicester remain 19th. Cunha was marginally off target from distance, while he also shot straight at Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Strand Larsen should have doubled the hosts’ lead when he fired over from two yards out, but the Wolves striker was not to be denied in the 56th minute; receiving a well-timed pass from Cunha and slotting past Hermansen. Leicester were given a lifeline in the 70th minute when Jose Sa felled Vardy in the box, but the Wolves goalkeeper atoned for his error by guessing correctly to deny Leicester's captain. Strand Larsen, who was off target from close range on two separate occasions, was third time lucky with a neat finish from Cunha's through-ball that was ultimately enough to put the game beyond Leicester. The hosts were given a scare when the referee awarded the Foxes a penalty in the final 20 minutes, but after Sa thwarted Vardy, it was fairly plain sailing to the finish line thereon with Rodrigo subsequently putting the icing on the cake. Leicester outfoxed\\nWith their Premier League fate already sealed, Leicester are now playing for pride in an attempt to build some momentum before returning to the Championship next season. The Foxes failed to heed their early warnings and were eventually punished as Cunha struck from close range. Leicester lost Bobby De Cordova-Reid to injury before the break, while Van Nistelrooy then made three changes at half-time. Vardy, who announced in the week he will leave Leicester at the end of the season, had the opportunity to begin his farewell tour with a goal, but his tame penalty was kept out by Sa in his bottom-right corner. Rodrigo then put the contest well and truly beyond the Foxes later on, as they failed to score in a 16th Premier League game this season.

Palace never led but were the better side for long stretches, responding to Jakub Kiwior's early opener with a fine Eberechi Eze goal before working hard to cancel out Leandro Trossard's strike shortly before half-time. The second equaliser arrived late and came in bizarre fashion as Saliba gifted the ball to Palace substitute Jean-Philippe Mateta, who executed a sublime lob that clipped the crossbar on its way in. The draw means Arsenal are 12 points off the pace with only four matches to play, while Palace are still 12th but a point closer to the European places. How the match unfolded\\nAn enthralling encounter began with the league's two most effective set-piece sides trading blows, with Kiwior's towering header from beyond the penalty spot after three minutesfollowed by Eze's volley from a right-wing corner on 27 minutes. A succession of Palace headers then had David Raya sweating in the second half as Justin Devenny notably miscued, while Daniel Munoz nodded across the face of goal. Dean Henderson then instinctively kept out Bukayo Saka, before Saliba's mistake was punished ruthlessly by Mateta, who saw Raya off his line, in the 87th minute, yet eight minutes of stoppage time did not bring the decisive goal. Perfect pre-Wembley pick-me-up for Palace\\nPalace head into their FA Cup semi-final clash with Aston Villa at Wembley with just one win in their six matches since the quarter-finals, having won four in a row in all competitions prior to that. But this was a return to form for Oliver Glasner's side, with the Austrian joining Mikel Arteta in making changes ahead of a big semi-final, and they might have seen off Arsenal had their first XI been on the pitch at the same time. Ex-Arsenal man Eddie Nketiah was wasteful with a couple of sights of goal in the first half, with Mateta making a big impact later on. By that point, fellow star men Adam Wharton and Eze had made way, but Palace kept pushing. If this was a missed opportunity, it is one Palace will be able to move on from quickly if they can upset high-flying Villa on Saturday.

The Cherries doubled their advantage in the second half through Evanilson’s dinked effort, only for Pape Sarr to reduce the deficit soon after with a fortuitous cross that sailed into the net. Bournemouth miss the chance to go sixth in the Premier League and instead only climb one place to eighth, above Newcastle United on goal difference. However, Bournemouth did take advantage of their opponents’ sloppy play in the 42nd minute, catching Spurs on the break as Kerkez’s excellent run and cross from the left was finished by the sliding Tavernier. After seeing a Justin Kluivert strike ruled out for offside following a VAR check, the Cherries doubled their lead in the 65th minute, the Dutch creator slipping in Evanilson, who dinked the ball over Vicario. Spurs, though, gave themselves a lifeline two minutes later when Sarr’s attempted cross looped over Kepa, and that would not be the Bournemouth goalkeeper's last involvement. His team were buoyed by the returns of Dominic\\xa0Solanke and Romero to their starting line-up, but the latter endured a difficult start and showed signs of rust, with the Argentinian making his first Premier League start since a 4-3 defeat to Chelsea back in December. Postecoglou’s side also looked unassured in possession, with several loose passes picked off by Bournemouth. The Cherries’ ferocious press caused Spurs plenty of early problems, and they were indebted to Vicario for making a couple of big saves. Indeed, it was Pedro\\xa0Porro’s giveaway that led to Bournemouth flying forward for the opener, with the Spurs players leaving the field to boos from their supporters at half-time. Cherries' European hopes falter\\nTalk of Bournemouth gatecrashing the European picture gathered pace as they made a strong start to 2025, but their momentum has faltered somewhat, having now gone three Premier League matches without a win. Having seen three chances come and go in the opening five minutes, Bournemouth stamped their authority on this contest and looked fitter and sharper than their under-pressure hosts. After Solanke’s tame header into Kepa's gloves gave them a warning, Bournemouth hit the front following a real moment of quality from Kerkez, who put the ball on a plate for Tavernier to tuck home. Iraola’s side had another sensational counter-attacking strike chalked off early in the second half due to an offside decision against Antoine Semenyo in the build-up, though they shook off that setback to go 2-0 up through Evanilson. Sarr’s goal swung the balance of the contest, though Bournemouth had their chances at 2-1.

However, Sarabia climbed off the bench to curl a superb 20-yard free-kick into the top corner 13 minutes from time to mathematically seal Wolves' top-flight status for another season. Wolves moved level on points with Ruben Amorim's side after a fifth straight victory, and now 17 clear of 18th-place Ipswich Town, who were beaten 4-0 by Arsenal on Sunday. Christian Eriksen's free-kick was tipped over by Dan Bentley, who was a late replacement in the Wolves goal after Jose Sa was injured during the warm-up, while Kobbie Mainoo curled wide from just outside the box. As the breakthrough continued to elude United, Wolves struck against the run of play in the 78th minute. Sarabia – shortly after replacing Jorgen Strand Larsen – curled a free-kick from just outside the box beyond the helpless dive of Andre Onana. The visitors had to stand firm for the remainder as United pushed for the equaliser, but did so to extend their superb run of form and, more importantly, ensure Premier League football will now officially return to Molineux next term. They were ultimately punished with Sarabia’s moment of magic bringing them right back down to earth. Wonderful Wolves secure safety\\nThey may have occupied 17th place before taking to the field at Old Trafford, but Wolves certainly arrived with a huge spring in their step. Matheus Cunha was back in the starting line-up, but it was Wolves’ defence that had to be on guard with United carrying the greater attacking threat. Nevertheless, the rejuvenated backline refused to budge and it was Cunha who was fouled for the awarding of the free-kick, which Sarabia bent into the top-right corner in sublime fashion.

It had looked like a comfortable afternoon for the Toffees. Bruno Fernandes pulled one back with a stunning free-kick in the second half, and almost scored a late winner, though he was denied by Jordan Pickford. Everton, meanwhile, saw a stoppage-time penalty decision overturned by the referee following a VAR review. Everton move up to 12th in the table, though remain one point above United, who stay 15th on 30 points. Jack Harrison’s low drive was parried into the air by Onana, and the Malian followed in to nod it over the line. Everton kept pushing in the second half and should have scored a third as Jake O’Brien clipped a cross into Beto, but his sweetly-hit volley was superbly saved by a stretching Onana. It took just eight more minutes for the visitors to flip the script, with Fernandes’ free-kick only headed as far as Ugarte, and his half-volley was just out of Pickford’s reach. Fernandes saw a long-range effort tipped over the bar shortly before Everton were awarded a stoppage-time penalty for a tug on Ashley Young by Harry Maguire but, after a VAR review, the on-field decision was overturned by referee Andy Madley. Everton falter late on\\nEverton’s resurgence under David Moyes has certainly impressed, and it looked set to continue with a win over his former club. However, while the Toffees enjoyed a late comeback against rivals Liverpool earlier this month, they found themselves on the wrong end of one this time. Beto, who made life difficult for Onana with his finish, will claim a lot of plaudits once again after becoming the first Everton player to score in four consecutive top-flight games since Richarlison in 2021. His driving run in behind cut open the United defence before he picked out Harrison, who might feel disappointed after hitting his shot straight at Onana. For 70 minutes, Everton were in cruise control. Beto and Harrison both had more chances to score, with the former’s volley their best chance of the second half, but they struggled to take advantage of United’s defence. The Everton fans were clearly aggrieved with the late penalty decision, with it deemed there was not enough contact on Young. Amorim’s first league win in charge of United was a 4-0 thrashing of Everton – then under Sean Dyche – but much of their final trip to Goodison Park could not have been further from that showing. They needed a moment of magic to get back into the game, with Fernandes’ free-kick leaving Pickford static on his line. The captain was at the heart of the comeback, having also delivered the free-kick that led to Ugarte’s superb finish, while his looping effort in the 89th minute was just tipped over the bar by Pickford.

Saints’ misery continues despite admirable second half\\nAny momentum taken from Ivan Juric’s first win as manager away to Ipswich Town was extinguished with last weekend’s FA Cup fourth-round defeat to Championship side Burnley, and Southampton’s latest defeat at home only compounds a season of struggles. Christie was afforded too much time to deliver the cross for the first goal while a wayward pass from Jan Bednarek just outside his own penalty area resulted in the Scotsman putting the game beyond the Saints after just 16 minutes. Substitute Tyler Dibling was at the centre of their most promising attacks, and Sulemana also carried a threat, capping his display with a fine goal to hand the Saints a lifeline. Southampton must take encouragement from that battling second-half display when they host another south-coast rival next weekend, as Brighton & Hove Albion visit St Mary’s.

The 26-year-old opened his City account with a lob from Ederson’s raking pass, then fired low into the bottom corner for his second before side-footing in his third just after the half-hour. Marmoush went off to a standing ovation before substitute James McAtee rounded out a comprehensive victory that leaves City three places and as many points clear of seventh-placed Newcastle. How the match unfolded\\nCity’s reward for a fine start came in the 19th minute as Ederson floated a sublime pass over Newcastle’s defence and Marmoush lofted a weighted finish over Martin Dubravka. Ederson beat away a fierce attempt from substitute Lewis Miley as Newcastle showed green shoots of recovery in the second half, though City swiftly quashed any further signs of revival. Marmoush was able to receive the plaudits from the home faithful when he made way off in the 76th minute, eight minutes before McAtee added further gloss as he hooked in from point-blank range following Haaland’s flick-on from a corner. Magnificent Marmoush makes his mark\\nOnly Harry Kane had scored more Bundesliga goals this season than Marmoush prior to the Egyptian’s move from Eintracht Frankfurt to City last month, so Pep Guardiola knew he was getting a top-tier finisher. And after some bright signs in his opening matches, Marmoush’s City career is now truly up and running. His hat-trick was City’s fourth-fastest in the club’s Premier League history (between the first and third goals), and his finishes displayed the variety he has in his locker. It might have been more for City in the first half – Savinho should have done better when put through by Phil Foden, and Erling Haaland saw a dangerous cross diverted just wide by Dan Burn. It will particularly please Guardiola that, on this occasion, City did not run the risk of allowing Newcastle back into the match. Guardiola, who was dealt some concern when Haaland went down clutching his knee late on, though the striker appeared to be okay as he made his way to the bench, will now want to see this level of performance in City’s huge encounters next week. Newcastle leave the Etihad empty-handed again\\nNewcastle have now lost their last 16 visits to City in the Premier League and remain winless at the Etihad Stadium in the competition. But even accounting for the Magpies’ torrid record at City, their first-half display will have deeply disappointed Howe.

Liverpool went ahead in the 30th minute as Gakpo went down in the area after being tripped by Cook, with the penalty confirmed following a VAR review that checked both the foul and a possible offside. Bournemouth continued to press, though, and Brooks drilled in an equaliser only to be denied by an offside call against Milos Kerkez, which was confirmed following a VAR review. The hosts did not let up in the second half, with Alisson making a close-range stop from Semenyo before Bournemouth missed their best chance to level in the 70th minute. Substitute Marcus Tavernier struck the post from distance, and in-form forward Kluivert somehow skewed wide of an open goal on the rebound. Cherries fall just short\\nBournemouth\\'s second season under Andoni Iraola has featured many high points, but perhaps last week\\'s 5-0 thrashing of high-flying Nottingham Forest – a result accomplished without injured strikers Evanilson and Enes Unal – was the pick of the bunch.

Wolves get their bite back\\nVitor Pereira had a fantastic start as Wolves boss, though his team came into this encounter on the back of four straight league defeats. Yet they showed their intent from the off, and the move that resulted in Bellegarde’s opener was not one that would necessarily be associated with a team scrapping for safety at the foot of the table, as Wolves worked it patiently from the left wing before Sarabia provided the incisive pass. Cunha and Guedes might feel they should have done better with their one-on-one opportunities, though Martinez did make himself big to keep Villa in contention. It looked as though Wolves would be punished for a defensive lapse – and those earlier misses – when Malen nudged home, but the offside flag and the subsequent VAR check ensured a reprieve. From there, Wolves defended stoutly, with Sa only called upon late in the match.

That has left Emery shorn of a backup striker, though, and if media reports are to be believed, Villa are making a move for Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford on loan. And after Saturday, that is a move that could well be vital for Villa to complete, with talisman Ollie Watkins having sustained an injury during the first half. That meant Malen had to fill in up front as Villa looked to turn the tide after the break, and the visitors were largely toothless despite the Dutchman’s endeavour. Villa may well feel hard done by when it comes to Malen’s disallowed goal, but this was a poor display by their high standards – indeed, they only went close again when Malen forced Sa into action in the 90th minute. Konsa’s blunder at the back for Cunha’s victory-sealing strike summed up the visitors' below-par display. While time will tell if they get a deal for Rashford over the line, Villa's immediate concern could well be Watkins’ fitness ahead of an FA Cup clash with Tottenham Hotspur next week, before they take on Ipswich on 15 February.

Palace grew into the game as the half went on – Mateta volleying over after Daniel Munoz closed down Victor Kristiansen’s clearance, while Will Hughes drilled over from distance. The visitors came flying out of the blocks after the break though, with Mateta latching onto Ismaila Sarr’s wonderful pass before rounding Stolarczyk, who was left scrambling, to fire into an empty net. Guehi then put the match beyond doubt late on, meeting Eberechi Eze’s scooped set-piece to volley it into the roof of the net. Foxes fizzle out\\nLeicester laid the foundations for a much-improved performance within the first two minutes, Facundo Buonanotte winning the ball back deep in Palace’s half and teeing up Vardy, whose shot was blocked. The defensive frailties that have set them back were on show again after half-time, Sarr managing to thread a ball through for Mateta to take one of the few clear chances the visitors created. Sturdy Eagles soar\\nPalace may not have played the swashbuckling football they are capable of in this win, but they proved they are such a solid team that it does not matter. Oliver Glasner’s side have now only lost one of their last 10 Premier League matches, against title-chasing Arsenal, as they climbed eight points clear of the relegation zone. Palace have beaten the current bottom three – Ipswich Town, Southampton and now Leicester – on that run, as well as a memorable victory away at rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. Those results suggest a comfortable mid-table finish is likely, but this win warrants particular credit considering the defensive reshuffle Glasner had to oversee in the build-up. At the other end, Sarr stood out in attack, the forward continuing to grow in confidence on his return to English football by setting up Mateta’s goal with an intelligent through-ball, before forcing Stolarczyk into a stoppage-time save that would have put the icing on the cake.

      "{\"Nott'm Forest\": \"Anthony Elanga scored for the third Premier League match in a row to move Nottingham Forest up to third as they beat Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 at the City Ground. Elanga, who had scored in wins over Aston Villa and Brentford, put the hosts into a 28th-minute lead after being brilliantly picked out by Morgan Gibbs-White, before prodding the ball home. Spurs rarely threatened Matz Sels throughout the contest, with the returning Brennan Johnson unable to find a way past the Forest goalkeeper with his three efforts on target. It was also an unhappy return for former Forest defender Djed Spence, who was given a second yellow card late on to hand Ange Postecoglou another defensive issue, having seen Radu Dragusin go off injured moments earlier. The win lifts Forest above Arsenal and into third ahead of the Gunners’ home encounter with Ipswich Town on Friday, while Spurs stay in 11th, 10 points off the top four. How the match unfolded\\nSon Heung-min was the first to test Sels in the opening exchanges following Murillo’s poor giveaway, before Callum Hudson-Odoi curled over after a quick Forest counter-attack. But the hosts would get themselves in front soon after when Gibbs-White’s pass in behind was poked home by Elanga. Johnson then saw his effort tipped over the bar by Sels shortly before the break after Dejan Kulusevski had done brilliantly to pick out the Welshman in the Forest box. Johnson continued to threaten after the break, brilliantly touching the ball beyond Murillo but was again met by Sels, with Elanga going close to doubling his tally but miscuing his effort. Fraser Forster then denied Gibbs-White from close range after parrying Elliot Anderson’s cross away, before Spence was handed his marching orders in second-half stoppage time for a mistimed tackle on Jota Silva. Forest advance on Europe\\nNuno Espirito Santo continues to play down Forest’s chances of reaching European football next season, but he is building something special at the City Ground this campaign, something he was unable to do during his short tenure with Spurs three years ago. After a slow start, which saw Ryan Yates booked for a foul on Son, meaning he will miss Forest’s trip to Goodison Park to face Everton on Sunday, they eventually found their groove when Elanga tucked home his third Premier League goal in as many matches in the competition. Forest continued to impress at both ends of the pitch, with Sels producing some important stops to deny Johnson, as Forster tipped away Anderson’s cross into the box before springing back to his feet to save from Gibbs-White. Though Spurs dominated possession, they were unable to carve out any meaningful chances, though Forest could have doubled their advantage late on when substitute Taiwo Awoniyi fired into the side-netting from a tight angle, despite having better options around him. Forest will be hoping to continue their impressive form but face a tough test against Everton at Goodison Park this Sunday, with the Toffees having held Manchester City 1-1 on Boxing Day. Spurs remain without Guglielmo Vicario, Richarlison, Ben Davies, Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, but started strong at the City Ground when Son tested Sels before Johnson stung the palms of the Forest goalkeeper moments later. But Elanga’s opener seemingly clicked Forest’s slick football into gear, though Johnson was again thwarted by Sels before Son closed out the first half by sending a free-kick into the side-netting, and that effort was arguably the closest Spurs came to getting themselves level. James Maddison was introduced from the bench but was unable to find the target, and amid Spurs’ pressure, they were unable to penetrate Forest's goal.\", 'Spurs': '.'}\n",

Morgan Gibbs-White doubled Forest’s tally just after the hour, with Wood turning provider, and only a fine double save from Pickford denied the visitors a third late on. Forest’s win moves them, at least temporarily, above Chelsea and Arsenal ahead of their respective fixtures on Monday and Wednesday, while Everton sit 16th.

Yet Forest dealt the first blow, with Wood finishing coolly over Pickford after a neat headed exchange with Elanga. But Nuno’s side doubled their advantage in the 61st minute when they pounced on a mix-up in Everton’s defence, with Gibbs-White chopping inside before finishing beyond Pickford.

Dyche’s defensive resilience broken\\nEverton have prided themselves on defensively solidity in recent weeks, but despite holding the Premier League’s elite sides to draws in December, the Toffees came unstuck against Forest, who remained compact at the back and ruthless in attack. Ndiaye’s early attempt offered the Goodison faithful some hope, but the stern defensive rearguard that had seen Everton concede just once across their previous four league matches was punctured by a moment of quality from Wood. Everton pushed for the equaliser, with Jarrad Branthwaite heading over Ashley Young’s inviting corner, before Armando Broja, making his first start for the club, wildly lashed his strike wide moments before the break. Jesper Lindstrom’s introduction at the interval attempted to inject some pace into the Everton attack, with the Dane curling an effort over the bar after good work from Abdoulaye Doucoure. But Everton were punished when a combination of Doucoure’s poor pass and Vitalii Mykolenko’s hesitation allowing Gibbs-White to seal the win for Forest, with substitutes Calvert-Lewin and Beto seeing headers saved in the closing stages. While Everton ended 2024 with a defeat, they will be hoping for a winning start to 2025 away to AFC Bournemouth next Saturday.

      "{'Man City': \"Amad inspired a remarkable late turnaround as Manchester United came from behind to seal a dramatic 2-1 derby victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Out-of-form City looked set to move within six points of Premier League leaders Liverpool after Josko Gvardiol's header put them in the ascendency in the first half. However, Pep Guardiola's side were far from their best throughout Sunday's contest and were hit with two late sucker punches, with Amad playing a central role in both goals. Man Utd climbed to 12th after snapping a two-game losing run and are now just five points adrift of City, who remain fifth, nine points off the top. How the match unfolded\\nPhil Foden flashed a volley past the right-hand post as City dominated possession in the early exchanges without carving out clear-cut chances. Kevin De Bruyne played a one-two with Ilkay Gundogan from a corner, with the Belgian’s subsequent cross looping up off Amad and to Gvardiol, who powered his header into the left-hand corner. But City did not kick on in the second half and failed to heed two huge warnings. City were masters of their own downfall when United finally levelled – Nunes played a back pass directly to Amad then promptly fouled the winger inside the area, allowing Fernandes to drill home from the spot. More misery for makeshift Man City\\nYet again, Guardiola was left stunned on the sidelines as City failed to win for the sixth time in seven Premier League matches. Since suffering the blow of losing Rodri to a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury, Guardiola and City have spent plenty of time searching for a way to take charge in midfield and cut down on chances conceded on the counter-attack. Injuries to Nathan Ake, Manuel Akanji and John Stones – who was back among the substitutes for this one – have not helped City's cause, and for this derby, Guardiola picked a starting XI featuring just three recognised defenders, with Nunes filling in at left-back. Given the makeshift nature of City's side, it was perhaps no surprise that they took their time to get going. Foden's miscued effort in the 21st minute was the first shot registered by either team in the match – the longest wait on record for a shot in a Premier League Manchester derby. The nervousness around the Etihad seemed to spread to those donning sky blue, and it was a glaring individual error from Nunes – followed by his desperate attempt to atone – that saw their lead evaporate. Shellshocked by Fernandes' equaliser, City were all over the place when Martinez launched a simple long ball down the middle, with Amad the benefactor, though he still had plenty of work to do. Having looked set to move back into the top four, City now have to regroup for a crucial matchup with Aston Villa next Saturday. The Red Devils got a huge slice of fortune when Nunes' moment of madness allowed them to equalise, but the character they showed to go on and snatch a winner will certainly please Amorim, who of course beat City with Sporting in the UEFA Champions League last month.

Rayan Ait-Nouri pulled one back for Wolves at the death, but they stay bottom with just one point, while Brentford go ninth in the table with 10. How the match unfolded\\nBrentford, who had scored in the first minute of their previous three Premier League matches, needed just 75 seconds to hit the front as Collins headed in from Mikkel Damsgaard's cross. Brentford inched back into the lead after Collins was hauled over by Mario Lemina at a corner, allowing Mbeumo to convert from the penalty spot, but again Wolves responded as Larsen flicked Ait-Nouri's cross home. Yet less than 90 seconds later, Brentford were back ahead – Norgaard drilling into the bottom-left corner. Pinnock subsequently nodded another Damsgaard cross past Johnstone just before half-time.

But the scoring wasn't over as Ait-Nouri fired through Mark Flekken’s legs at the other end for a stoppage-time consolation. Brentford fired set-piece after set-piece into the Wolves area, and the visiting backline – deprived of centre-back Yerson Mosquera after an anterior cruciate ligament injury – was simply unable to cope.

Brentford bombarded Johnstone's goal at every opportunity, especially from set-pieces, and just over a minute had passed when Collins – who endured one difficult season at Molineux in 2022/23 – ghosted into the area to nod home. Pinnock took advantage of more miserable back-post defending from the visitors to add the Bees' fourth, and from there they could simply sit back and pick Wolves off on the break, with Janelt and Schade both close to extending their lead before Carvalho did the honours.

Fourteen minutes later, Collins was involved again as he stole a march on Lemina from a corner, the Wolves captain dragging him to the ground to concede a needless spot-kick. Pinnock took advantage of more miserable back-post defending from the visitors to add the Bees' fourth, and from there they could simply sit back and pick Wolves off on the break, with Janelt and Schade both close to extending their lead before Carvalho did the honours.

Wissa and Mbeumo and rule after Toney’s exit\\nDespite the exit of their most high-profile name in Ivan Toney, Brentford fans were confident over the Wissa-Mbeumo axis thriving in the post-Toney era, and the signs look very positive. Wissa\\'s breakthrough strike in the Bees’ first-half comeback, and his key role in forcing Clarke\\'s own goal, combined with Mbeumo taking centre stage after the interval, showed just how adept the duo are at pulling defences out of shape. Mbeumo\\'s sharpness to drop in and link with the midfield eases the pressure on Brentford\\'s engine room with Wissa\\'s pace and directness in behind giving the feel of a throwback front two. There was a touch of fortune about Mbeumo’s winner, but his confidence from the spot earlier on proves he is excelling as one of Brentford’s go-to men. Thomas Frank’s side had a tough time of it last season, but if Mbeumo and Wissa stay fit, then a top-half finish is on the cards.

Kepa's questionable positioning when attempting to cut out Konate's long ball created Diaz’s well-taken opener, before the Colombian produced another confident low finish after Alexander-Arnold's marauding inside run. Nunez capped a ruthless first-half display in style after being played through in a give-and-go with Salah, and that dominance allowed Slot to further flex his attacking muscle in the second half.

Bruno Fernandes had earlier squandered United’s best chances, with Leno in excellent form for the visitors.

However, on both occasions he fluffed his lines when one-on-one with Leno. Fulham’s goalkeeper was then on hand to deny Mason Mount in the second half.

While Fernandes should have done better in those one-v-ones, Leno made himself big and reacted sharply to charge off his line, as he did to thwart Mount early in the second half. Marco Silva may be frustrated with his attackers, though. Fulham created openings, with Traore particularly impactful down the right flank, yet the Cottagers could just not apply the finishing touch, or find the final pass, when it mattered most. With new England interim manager Lee Carsley watching on from the stands, Emile Smith Rowe had a rather quiet debut, though if Leno shows the same level of form throughout the campaign, there is no reason for the Cottagers not to have high hopes for this season, as long as that composure and guile does arrive in the final third.

Encouraging signs for Forest\\nDespite the sucker punch they suffered near the end of the match, Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo will surely be encouraged by his side’s performance.

But with two of the division’s leading marksmen in Wissa and Mbeumo up front, they always have the firepower to win games – a fact proven on Saturday. Mbeumo took his first goal nicely with his wrong foot, before he enjoyed some luck as a left-footed shot found the corner via a big deflection off Dunk to restore Brentford’s lead early in the second half. He then turned provider for his partner, teeing up Wissa to slam in a third just before the hour mark, seemingly putting Brentford in control, and despite a slightly nervy ending, they held out for a vital three points. The goals took Mbeumo to 18 and Wissa to 16 Premier League strikes this season, with only Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak, Erling Haaland and Chris Wood keeping pace.

City had to wait until the 84th minute to break the deadlock on their final trip to Goodison Park, where Nico O’Reilly put them in front with a close-range finish after Everton’s defence had largely frustrated Pep Guardiola’s side. Everton had earlier hit a post through James Tarkowski, who subsequently went off injured, while Jarrad Branthwaite saw a close-range header saved by Stefan Ortega. City move into fourth place, a point behind Newcastle United in third, while Everton remain 13th, having lost a Premier League game at home for the first time since January. Matheus Nunes hit a low drive on target, though it was dealt with by Jordan Pickford, before Tarkowski’s glancing header from James Garner’s corner struck the right-hand post. That Everton opportunity sparked City into life – Kevin De Bruyne’s curling left-footed attempt seemed destined for the bottom-left corner until Jake O’Brien stooped low to head it wide. Ortega reacted well to keep out Branthwaite’s looping header after the restart, while Abdoulaye Doucoure saw an effort bravely blocked by Josko Gvardiol, though an apparent hamstring injury to defensive stalwart Tarkowski knocked Everton’s rhythm. An error from replacement Michael Keane gifted Omar Marmoush a chance the Egyptian failed to take, but O’Reilly made no mistake when he got in front of the Everton centre-back moments later to tap in from Nunes’ centre.

Toffees come unstuck at Goodison\\nThere are now just two games left for Everton at Goodison Park, with strugglers Ipswich Town and Southampton visiting in May. David Moyes’ team gave a good account of themselves, but he will have probably been disappointed they did not offer more of an attacking threat, despite showing some positive signs with those big chances for Tarkowski and Branthwaite. Doucoure was Everton’s hero last time out, snatching three vital points with a stoppage-time winner in an evenly-matched contest against Nottingham Forest, but he could not make a telling impact, while Iliman Ndiaye cut a frustrated figure out on the left, and Jack Harrison flitted in and out of things, although he did get close to a perfectly-weighted cross from Vitalii Mykolenko at one point. Moyes may well point to that injury to Tarkowski as the turning point. An ever-present since he joined Everton from Burnley, the centre-back left a void in defence when he trudged off, and Keane was at least partially at fault for City’s opener. Everton round off April with a trip to London to face Chelsea, before they are back at home for that visit of Ipswich – Moyes will not want Goodison Park to witness another Toffees defeat.

Mario Lemina had given the hosts the lead by rounding off a free-flowing counterattack late in the first half, sweeping home following a clever dummy from Joao Gomes. The result keeps Wolves in the bottom three with just a single point, while Newcastle move up to third with 10, ahead of their meeting with Fulham next week. But Wolves grew in confidence as the first half went on and took the lead nine minutes before the break. Jorgen Strand Larsen’s cross was cleverly dummied by Gomes, allowing captain Lemina to tap home from close range. Lemina could then have doubled his tally after being picked out by the industrious Andre, but he failed to test Nick Pope in the Newcastle net as he scuffed his left-footed effort wide. Wolves continued to threaten on the break in the second half, with Larsen's effort striking the base of the post, but two bolts from the blue took the game away from them late on. A huge deflection off the head of Craig Dawson carried Schar's 25-yard effort out of Johnstone's reach and into the top-left corner, then Barnes cut inside from the left to beat the Wolves goalkeeper with a rasping strike from range. Only a stunning save from Pope kept Matheus Cunha's stoppage-time volley out, but Newcastle clung on, almost adding a third when Barnes sent a dinked effort wide at the death. Brazilian duo impress in defeat\\nWolves’ return from the international break ended in heartbreaking fashion as one moment of misfortune and one piece of individual brilliance made the difference. But there were positives for Gary O'Neil to take despite the result.

Ian Maatsen and Amadou Onana struck either side of a Dan Burn own goal in the second half at Villa Park, where Unai Emery's team thoroughly deserved their victory. Ollie Watkins had scored Villa's opener in the first minute and could have had a perfect hat-trick before half-time, but he twice rattled the woodwork, with those chances coming either side of Fabian Schar’s equaliser. Villa always carried the greater threat, though, and they pulled clear after Maatsen scored his first Premier League goal, climbing to sixth in the Premier League on 57 points. How the match unfolded\\nJust 33 seconds were on the clock when Villa went ahead, with Watkins' strike deflecting off Schar to wrong-foot Nick Pope after the hosts pressed high to recover possession. Watkins almost had another in the fifth minute, but his effort cannoned back off the crossbar and Newcastle hit back in the 18th minute, Schar ghosting in to nod Harvey Barnes' cross home. Marco Asensio scuffed his shot when presented with an immediate chance to restore Villa's lead, then Watkins again hit the woodwork, his bullet header bouncing off the left post. Not deterred by those near-misses, Villa picked up where they left off in the second half and retook the lead when Watkins played in Maatsen for a powerful finish across goal in the 64th minute. Villa had the third goal their pressure warranted nine minutes later, with Jacob Ramsey's low cross being deflected in by the unfortunate Burn. Watkins back with a bang\\nThe loan signing of Marcus Rashford has led to a reduction in playing time for Watkins, who declared after a 3-0 win at Southampton last week that he was not happy with playing a supporting role. Watkins started on the bench in both legs of Villa's Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, but was restored to the line-up here and produced a talismanic performance. His early strike drew him level with Gabriel Agbonlahor as Villa's joint-leading Premier League scorer, with 74 goals in the competition. Rogers' strong hold-up play and Asensio's slick ball out to the left had Watkins running at the Newcastle backline, and he timed his pass to perfection to tee up Maatsen. Watkins has now both scored and assisted in eight separate Premier League matches since the start of last season, and with the England international at the top of his game and plenty of other options available, Villa will feel momentum is on their side in the European race as they look for an immediate return to the Champions League, after their midweek exit. Reality check for Newcastle\\nNewcastle have enjoyed facing Villa lately, winning three straight games against them by scorelines of 5-1, 3-1 and 3-0 coming into this one. But perhaps the effort required in Wednesday's 5-0 rout of Crystal Palace told here, as they simply failed to deal with Villa's dynamism. The visiting defence was nowhere to be seen when Watkins took Youri Tielemans' pass under his spell on the left side of the area early on, and Schar's weak attempt to block only sent the ball spinning in at the near post. And while Schar redeemed himself to equalise with the aid of a magnificent cross from in-form winger Barnes, Newcastle buckled in the face of relentless Villa pressure after the break. Villa's substitutes Onana, Rashford, Ramsey, Donyell Malen and Ross Barkley injected more running power and the game was up at 4-1, with Tindall replacing Alexander Isak and Barnes to rest them for upcoming assignments.

But Brighton offered a warning of their attacking quality when Joao Pedro struck the woodwork and, albeit against the run of play, they took a 25th-minute lead when Mitoma finished from close range after he was picked out at the back post by Minteh. Everton seemed to have been handed a lifeline when Dominic Calvert-Lewin tangled with Lewis Dunk in Brighton’s area, but after awarding a penalty on-pitch, the VAR Chris Kavanagh advised referee Simon Hooper to review the decision. After watching a replay on the backup monitor Hooper overturned his decision after deeming that Calvert-Lewin had stood on Dunk. Sean Dyche’s frustrations only grew when Idrissa Gueye’s loose pass was punished by Welbeck, who coolly swept home from the edge of the area to put Brighton in complete control. Young became the oldest player to receive a Premier League red card after a heavy touch led him to pulling back Mitoma, and Adingra was on hand to add further gloss to a convincing win with a fine finish from outside of the box in the 86th minute.

      "{'Crystal Palace': 'Manchester United were held to a frustrating goalless draw away at Crystal Palace as Erik ten Hag\\'s attack failed to fire again, despite 24 shots in total and a brilliant display from both goalkeepers. Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson frustrated his former side throughout, though Oliver Glasner\\'s Palace team could have snatched victory if not for missed second-half chances from Ismaila Sarr, denied by Onana\\'s wonderful double-save, and Eberechi Eze. The result leaves Palace in 16th, two points clear of the bottom three, while United are 11th. Eze squandered a glorious chance with 18 minutes remaining, placing wide with the goal at his mercy from Sarr\\'s cutback pass, as Palace\\'s wait for their first win of the season continued. Struggling start continues for Glasner\\nGlasner appeared to have transformed Palace\\'s fortunes after replacing Roy Hodgson, winning six of the final seven league games last season. That form has not followed into this season, however, with Palace\\'s struggling attack missing the influence of star winger Michael Olise after his move to Bayern Munich. Eze and Jean-Phillipe Mateta do remain from last term\\'s deadly attacking trio, and the England midfielder almost netted before the break when directing straight at Onana from Tyrick Mitchell\\'s cutback offload. Glasner searched for solutions at half-time, replacing the ineffective Mateta with Sarr, who immediately linked up well with Eze to provide some home excitement. The Palace winger made amends for that missed opportunity, leaving two United defenders on the floor before sliding back for Eze, who guided a right-footed finish wide of the bottom-right corner under little pressure. Glasner must find a way for Palace to improve in front of goal if they are to move away from the lower part of the table, with their next clash coming away to struggling Everton. United lack clinical edge\\nGoals remain the problem for Ten Hag, with United finding the net just five times this season – only Crystal Palace (four), Ipswich Town (three) and Southampton (two) have scored fewer among teams to have played five games in the competition. That issue does not come from struggling to create chances, with Christian Eriksen twice finding De Ligt from set-piece situations at Selhurst Park, only to be thwarted by the one-man wall of Henderson. De Ligt\\'s centre-back partner Lisandro Martinez almost squirmed another chance under the desperate dive of the Palace goalkeeper, who also foiled Garnacho with a fine save early on.

Victory means the Gunners join fellow potential title contenders Liverpool and Manchester United among the teams on three points, with Wolves in the bottom three, albeit after only one match. It needed a remarkable save from David Raya to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen a debut Wolves goal, while at the other end Joao Gomes made a terrific block to frustrate Gabriel Martinelli after a terrific through ball from Declan Rice. Wolves certainly picked up, though, and substitute Matheus Cunha should have done more to make William Saliba pay for a misplaced pass. That profligacy was punished when Saka stepped inside Rayan Ait-Nouri on the right of the area and beat Sa at his near post to take the match beyond Wolves in the 74th minute. There were a couple of signs of early-season rust from the Gunners in a second period, when Wolves certainly had their chances, though, and a packed-out Emirates Stadium was certainly getting agitated.

Ange Postecoglou’s side fell behind after just 23 seconds as Bryan Mbeumo superbly volleyed home Keane Lewis-Potter’s cross. However, the hosts hit back seven minutes later through Dominic Solanke's first goal for the club after Mark Flekken parried James Maddison’s initial effort. Tottenham move above their opponents into 10th place in the Premier League with seven points, one more than Thomas Frank’s side in 12th after five rounds of matches. How the match unfolded\\nBrentford, who stunned Manchester City after just 22 seconds last weekend, came flying out of the blocks once more with Mbeumo volleying them into the lead in north London. Maddison pounced on Ethan Pinnock's loose pass and Flekken could only push his shot straight to Solanke, who tucked home the rebound. Johnson then rounded off a swift counter on 28 minutes when he fired past Flekken from a tight angle to make it goals in back-to-back games in all competitions. Flekken and Guglielmo Vicario made some good saves to keep the scoring down, but Spurs made sure of the win when Cristian Romero broke up a Brentford attack five minutes from time and found Son Heung-min, who squared for Maddison to dink home. The team scoring first had not won the previous four Premier League meetings between the sides, so Tottenham will not have been too concerned by Mbeumo's early strike. Solanke was in the right place at the right time to open his Spurs account with the equaliser, while Johnson finished well across Flekken. Some smart Flekken saves prevented the scoreline from being more comfortable for Postecoglou's side, but they could eventually breathe easier when Maddison put the result beyond doubt. Brentford's fast start fizzles out\\nAlthough they left the Etihad Stadium empty handed last week, Brentford could certainly take plenty of positives from their performance against the reigning champions. The Bees built on that momentum with another scintillating start, becoming only the second team in Premier League history – after City – to score in the opening minute of successive games. To their credit, Brentford stuck to the task and made sure they stayed in the contest until the 85th minute, when Maddison sealed the points. Nevertheless, their form is certainly ropey away from the Gtech Community Stadium, where they have won both their opening two fixtures this season, so they will be thankful for back-to-back home outings against West Ham and Wolves to come.

Semenyo’s eighth Premier League goal of the season was enough to snap a run of six top-flight matches without a win for the Cherries. Bournemouth – who pegged Fulham back to a 2-2 draw late on in the reverse fixture in December – had to hold onto their lead for all but the opening 53 seconds of Monday’s encounter. Evanilson squandered a chance to make matters more comfortable for Bournemouth when he hit the crossbar from close range, but Fulham could not make their hosts pay for that profligacy. The victory takes Bournemouth up into eighth, a place above Fulham and right back in the mix for European qualification, while the Cottagers’ slim hopes of pushing for a UEFA Champions League place have likely been extinguished. Bournemouth have now matched their record Premier League points tally of 48, which they set last season. How the match unfolded\\nThe Cherries hit the front as Semenyo pounced on Antonee Robinson’s loose touch and dispatched expertly beyond Bernd Leno. Semenyo is the scorer of Bournemouth\\'s third-earliest goal in the Premier League after Philip Billing against Arsenal in March 2023 (nine seconds) and Matt Ritchie against Tottenham Hotspur in October 2015 (49 seconds). Bournemouth should have doubled their lead in the 17th minute. The hosts have hit the woodwork more times than any other Premier League side this season (21), with Evanilson the 10th different player to do so for Bournemouth. However, the Bournemouth goalkeeper was not really tested otherwise and, despite Evanilson seeing a penalty appeal waved away late on, Andoni Iraola’s team held firm to bring a welcome end to their winless streak. Bournemouth back on track\\nWithout a win after 90 minutes in their last eight matches across all competitions, Bournemouth were also staring down the barrel of suffering five straight Premier League home defeats for the first time in their history. Evanilson cut a frustrated figure after he failed to add to their lead, but Fulham really never came all that close to truly testing Kepa, who was well protected by the excellent Dean Huijsen – the Bournemouth centre-back turning in a fine display on his 20th birthday. Having conceded two goals in each of their last five league outings, Bournemouth needed this clean sheet.

Across their last eight league matches, Fulham have now alternated between defeats and wins, and the momentum they had from that brilliant victory over Liverpool swiftly dissipated with Semenyo’s early strike. That being said, Silva’s team came into this one having scored in all 14 of their away matches in the league this season, so they would not have been panicking. Iwobi failed to find his usual spark, while Muniz struggled to get into the game. Silva shuffled his pack with a triple change just before the hour-mark, and the visitors subsequently increased the pressure in their search for an equaliser.

But in a potential blow to their hopes of securing UEFA Champions League qualification, Chelsea – who went 2-0 down in the first half – could not find a way past an inspired Alex Palmer late on. Goals from Julio Enciso and Ben Johnson left the Blues stunned before the break, but Axel Tuanzebe’s own goal saw Chelsea pull one back just after the restart. Sancho’s curler restored parity, with Trevoh Chalobah, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez all going agonisingly close late on as Chelsea moved into fifth, but missed the chance to ensure they finished the weekend in the UEFA Champions League places. How the match unfolded\\nNicolas Jackson squandered a great early chance for Chelsea when he clattered the woodwork from close range, and Ipswich made the Blues pay when Johnson squared for Enciso in the 19th minute. Jens Cajuste bent a 20-yard effort narrowly past Robert Sanchez’s post as boos began to ring around Stamford Bridge, and they grew louder when Enciso returned the favour to Johnson with a fine cross, and the defender headed home. But within seconds of the restart, Chelsea pulled one back – Noni Madueke surged down the right and supplied teasing ball towards Marc Cucurella, which the stretching Tuanzebe could only divert in. Goalkeeper Palmer was Ipswich’s hero as Chelsea pushed hard in the final stages, making a string of super stops to keep the hosts at bay. Chelsea’s bump in the road\\nA home match against one of the Premier League’s bottom three provided, on paper at least, an ideal opportunity for Chelsea to get firmly back on track in their push for Champions League qualification, following last week’s draw with Brentford. Yet Ipswich – who beat the Blues in the reverse fixture at Portman Road – ripped up the script and forced Chelsea to do it the hard way to salvage a point. With Manchester City and Aston Villa picking up big wins on Saturday, and Newcastle United still to play this weekend, this is a stumble Chelsea may not have been able to afford. Scrutiny over the suitability of Jackson, who is without a Premier League goal in 2025, as the man to lead Chelsea’s line forward is likely to continue after his early miss. Then there has been the dip in form of key man Palmer. With Everton, Liverpool and Manchester United the next three teams to visit Stamford Bridge in the league, the pressure is certainly on the race for the Champions League places.

Mohammed Kudus put West Ham ahead early on, only for Dejan Kulusevski to level towards the end of an entertaining first half. Then goalkeeper Alphonse Areola scored an own goal in the 55th minute, before Son Heung-min struck the third goal in the 60th minute that settled the contest. To add to West Ham's woes, Kudus was sent off late on as they drop to 15th in the Premier League table with eight points from as many matches, while Spurs go seventh with 13. How the match unfolded\\nThe visitors struck first in the 18th minute when Jarrod Bowen showed great tenacity to keep an attack alive before crossing for Kudus, who scored at the far post. Brennan Johnson was guilty of a glaring miss when he nodded Destiny Udogie's cross wide, but Spurs did level in the 36th minute, Kulusevski's strike hitting both posts and crossing the line despite West Ham goalkeeper Areola getting fingertips to it. Spurs' third goal came in fortuitous fashion as Son's shot deflected off Jean-Clair Todibo and Areola before squirming over the line. Son clipped the foot of the post one minute later, and West Ham's miserable outing was capped when Kudus saw red for violent conduct. Maddison played a key role in Kulusevski's leveller, capitalising on a West Ham turnover to drive over halfway and find the Swede near the right corner of the box, yet he did not emerge for the second half as Postecoglou chose to introduce Pape Sarr. His clever reverse pass played in Son to force the own goal, while it was Sarr who provided the assist when Son made it 4-1 on the hour-mark, his pinpoint pass allowing the Spurs skipper to drive at Areola and arrow his finish inside the near post. No lift-off for Lopetegui\\nHaving thrashed Ipswich Town 4-1 prior to the international break, West Ham were eyeing their first back-to-back Premier League victories since March. The Julen Lopetegui era appeared to have lift-off when Kudus gave them a surprise lead against Spurs, the winger scoring for a second straight match, but the Hammers' defence began to creak under constant pressure and they could have no complaints when Kulusevski equalised. In the second half, West Ham simply failed to lay a glove on their hosts. Bissouma was granted the freedom of the penalty area to score Spurs' second goal, and the subsequent mix-up between Areola and Todibo summed up the visitors' performance. To add to Lopetegui's frustrations, Spurs' third goal came just as he was readying a triple substitution in a bid to turn the tide. In the end, West Ham were arguably fortunate to limit their hosts to four goals, with Kulusevski, Johnson and Timo Werner all passing up late chances.

Bees talisman Toney was left out of the hosts’ squad for Sunday’s match at the Gtech Community Stadium, with Thomas Frank confirming before kick-off that the decision was made due to transfer interest in the striker. But his absence was not felt as Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring just before the half-hour mark, cutting onto his favoured left foot to stroke into the bottom-left corner. However, Palace - who saw efforts from Eberechi Eze and Odsonne Edouard disallowed in either half - came on strong in the second period and levelled through Ethan Pinnock’s own goal. The Eagles were caught out as the match became stretched, though, with Wissa converting from close range 14 minutes from time to seal the points for Brentford, and their first Premier League victory over Palace, moving them up to fifth in the early standings. Referee Samuel Barrott had, however, awarded a free-kick to Brentford for a foul by Will Hughes on Nathan Collins. Brentford took full advantage of that reprieve three minutes later, as a flowing move down the right culminated in Mbeumo cutting inside to bend home. Increased Palace pressure paid off after 56 minutes, though - Pinnock turning into his own net after Daniel Munoz had headed across the face of goal. Edouard was flagged marginally offside when racing clear to beat Mark Flekken, and Brentford made that fortune count when Wissa bundled in after Dean Henderson had parried Collins' scuffed effort. Flekken made a late stop to keep out Eze's deflected strike as Palace desperately pushed for another equaliser, but those efforts were fruitless. No Toney, no problem\\nThere would have been plenty of concern among Brentford's supporters as they filtered into the Gtech Community Stadium, reeling from the news that star striker Toney had been left out of the matchday squad. And with record signing Igor Thiago unlikely to make his debut until late 2024 after suffering a meniscus injury in pre-season, the Bees were left without an attacking focal point. That did not seem to affect them, however, as their fluid front three of Wissa, Mbeumo and Kevin Schade pulled Palace's backline apart time and again in the latter stages of the first half. Wissa - himself a reported target for Wolverhampton Wanderers - and Mbeumo combined beautifully for the latter's opener, and though Palace enjoyed a strong spell to start the second half, Wissa was in the right place at the right time to restore Brentford's lead at a crucial point in the match. If Brentford must face the prospect of life without Toney, who is their all-time leading Premier League scorer with 36 goals, they can take heart from Wissa and Mbeumo stepping up when their team needed them most. The Bees will likely need that form to continue when they visit Liverpool next week. That optimism remained intact despite the sale of Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and persistent speculation over the future of Marc Guehi who, unlike Toney, played the full 90 minutes amid reported interest from Newcastle United. The England international did not enjoy his finest performance, arguably being slow to engage Mbeumo as the Brentford winger bustled into the area to open the scoring. While the early stages of the second half saw Palace up the ante with Eze and Adam Wharton, who drew solid saves out of Flekken, both increasingly influential, the guile of Olise and the power of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was withdrawn at half-time after representing France at the Olympic Games - was sorely missed.

That optimism remained intact despite the sale of Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and persistent speculation over the future of Marc Guehi who, unlike Toney, played the full 90 minutes amid reported interest from Newcastle United. While the early stages of the second half saw Palace up the ante with Eze and Adam Wharton, who drew solid saves out of Flekken, both increasingly influential, the guile of Olise and the power of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was withdrawn at half-time after representing France at the Olympic Games - was sorely missed. All in all, the result represents a reality check for Glasner's side, who must regroup for a pair of London derbies against West Ham United and Chelsea before the season's first international break.

The reigning champions move on to 20 points, but remain one point behind Liverpool, following the Reds' 2-1 win over Chelsea at Anfield, while Wolves return to the foot of the table following their late heartbreak. City levelled in the 33rd minute when Gvardiol whipped a fierce 20-yard strike into Sa's top-left corner, though the Wolves goalkeeper produced another smart stop to keep out a Savinho shot just before the break. Both sides went close in the early stages of the second half; Sa got down well again to deny Ruben Dias from distance, while Matheus Cunha swept a long-range effort narrowly wide. But in the fifth minute of stoppage time, Wolves’ resolve was broken as Stones buried his header beyond a helpless Sa, with the goal given following a VAR review. Late heartbreak for Wolves\\nFor the first time in 20 years, Wolves had failed to win any of their opening seven matches in a league season and despite Gary O’Neil’s continued faith in his team, the pressure was starting to mount. Therefore, they certainly would have been forgiven for not relishing the prospect of welcoming the reigning Premier League champions to Molineux. But their defensive resilience was the standout feature for much of the game – as City grew into it, and eventually brought themselves level, Wolves continued to make life difficult for Pep Guardiola’s side as they desperately tried to hold onto what would have been a morale-boosting second point of the season. Despite Wolves stubbornly keeping them at bay, City kept probing and Stones, who snatched a last-gasp equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Arsenal, was the right man in the right place once more with his thumping header turning one point into three.

City levelled in the 33rd minute when Gvardiol whipped a fierce 20-yard strike into Sa's top-left corner, though the Wolves goalkeeper produced another smart stop to keep out a Savinho shot just before the break. City turned up the pressure in search of a winner, with Silva firing into the side-netting before Matheus Nunes saw his effort deflected over the crossbar. But in the fifth minute of stoppage time, Wolves’ resolve was broken as Stones buried his header beyond a helpless Sa, with the goal given following a VAR review. Stones’ goal was initially disallowed on-field due to Silva being in an offside position and in the goalkeeper’s line of vision. But their defensive resilience was the standout feature for much of the game – as City grew into it, and eventually brought themselves level, Wolves continued to make life difficult for Pep Guardiola’s side as they desperately tried to hold onto what would have been a morale-boosting second point of the season.

Comeback kings strike again\\nGoing behind is familiar territory for City so far this season, this was the fourth time that they have conceded the opening goal, but as with the previous three occasions, they fought back to win. So, when Strand Larsen opened the scoring, there certainly would not have been cause for any panic as far as Guardiola was concerned. City gradually found their feet before Gvardiol’s superb strike brought them on level terms and it was only smart saves from Sa which prevented the visitors from completing the turnaround sooner.

      "{'Liverpool': \"Liverpool moved two wins away from the Premier League title as Virgil van Dijk made amends for a late mistake with a last-gasp winner in a 2-1 victory over West Ham United. Sunday seemed set to belong to Mohamed Salah, who celebrated his new two-year contract at Anfield with an assist for Luis Diaz's 18th-minute opener. That saw Salah break the record for the most goal involvements in a 38-match season in the competition with 45, though his achievement was overshadowed by late drama. Van Dijk scuffed Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross on to Andy Robertson, who turned the ball into his own net with four minutes remaining, only for the Liverpool captain to then head in the winner from Alexis Mac Allister's 89th-minute corner. The late victory leaves Arne Slot's side needing only six points from their remaining six matches to clinch the title, while West Ham – who hit the bar in search of a second equaliser through substitute Niclas Fullkrug\\xa0– drop to 17th spot. How the match unfolded\\nSalah flashed wide after skimming past Ollie Scarles early on, before repeating the dose just a minute later and, this time, curling a delightful pass for Diaz to tap into an empty net. West Ham almost struck back only three minutes later as Alisson denied Carlos Soler before Mohammed Kudus dinked a delicate chip over the Liverpool goalkeeper, only to be thwarted by the crossbar. Mac Allister's free-kick from a tight angle crashed against the woodwork shortly after the interval, though West Ham remained a threat as Soler blazed over and Alisson raced out to brilliantly deny Jarrod Bowen in a 1v1 situation. A deserved equaliser eventually arrived as Van Dijk hit Wan-Bissaka's left-sided delivery into Robertson, only for Diaz to rattle the crossbar at the other end moments later, before Van Dijk towered to power Mac Allister's corner past Alphonse Areola. Record-breaking Salah sets tone before late chaos\\nSalah's name continually echoed around Anfield as Liverpool supporters toasted the news of their Egyptian star's contract extension – and their hero soon repaid the rapturous show of faith. Salah continued in his role as chief creator, lifting through before seeing Areola deny Mac Allister, whose free-kick strike then rattled the woodwork following Jean-Clair Todibo's 46th-minute foul on Kostas Tsimikas. Mac Allister's mishit cross then almost found the top corner before Areola superbly tipped over, although Liverpool's unconvincing defence was deservedly punished at the other end by Robertson's unfortunate own goal. Sunday's second-half showing was far from the rip-roaring style of Liverpool's last title win under Jurgen Klopp in the 2019/20 season, but Slot's side still got over the line thanks to Van Dijk. Even if Arsenal remain perfect in their pursuit, this win means Liverpool can secure the title on 27 April with victory at home to Tottenham Hotspur, should the Reds also win at Leicester City next Sunday. Potter magic needed to turnaround West Ham form\\nWinless in four matches since a 2-0 victory over Leicester on 27 February, Graham Potter may have been fearing the worst heading into a thankless task at Anfield. Scarles was exposed by the quality of Salah from the off, too, with Lucas Paqueta and Kudus offering little protection for the 19-year-old wing-back, but West Ham certainly had their chances. Wan-Bissaka's offload almost freed Soler to slot past Alisson, who scrambled as Kudus' clipped rebound bounced off the woodwork. The midfielder was struck on the arm by Mac Allister's corner, but his action was deemed accidental after a VAR check agreed with referee Andy Madley's call of no penalty.

      "{'Leicester': \"Jamie Vardy made Tottenham Hotspur pay for their wastefulness as Leicester City started the Steve Cooper era by battling to a 1-1 draw on their Premier League return. Ex-Leicester man James Maddison set up Pedro Porro to head home the opener in Monday's match, which Ange Postecoglou's visitors dominated for large periods. But 37-year-old veteran Vardy, whom Cooper had ruled out with an injury only a few days before, scored a ninth career Premier League goal against Spurs to delight the home supporters. How the match unfolded\\nLeicester had already resisted a wave of Spurs attacks when Maddison's clipped ball was flicked into the bottom-right corner by Porro after 29 minutes. Solanke and Bentancur were then thwarted by Mads Hermansen and Spurs' wastefulness was punished when Abdul Fatawu's dink from the right side of the area was nodded in at the back post by Vardy just before the hour-mark. It could have got even better for Vardy and Leicester as he was played through on goal, but Guglielmo Vicario made a fantastic save. Bentancur was helped from the field on a stretcher after clashing heads with Fatawu, causing a lengthy delay. Evergreen Vardy still the man for Leicester\\nLeicester paid an emotional tribute to former manager and assistant Craig Shakespeare, who passed away earlier this month, before kick-off. Nigel Pearson – the last man before Enzo Maresco to get the Foxes promoted to the Premier League – was in attendance to pay tribute to his great friend. Maresca's departure for Chelsea in June means Cooper is the new man in the dugout, and the former Nottingham Forest boss will be all too aware of the challenges facing Leicester this season. Indeed, on a different day the Foxes could have been out of it by half-time, with Bentancur denied on the line by Wilfred Ndidi and Hermansen thwarting Johnson and Solanke, before Richarlison fluffed his lines. But Vardy, even at the age of 37, remains a talisman for the Foxes and he was in the right place at the right time to score a ninth career Premier League goal against Spurs in the 57th minute. Incredibly, Vardy – part of Leicester's famous title triumph in the 2015/16 campaign – nearly found a winner, only for Vicario to deny him. Maddison impresses on return but isn't rewarded\\nMaddison was once a hugely popular figure at Leicester but he was met with a mixture of audible boos and some applause on his first return to the King Power Stadium since departing in June 2023. New boy Solanke, signed in a reported £65million deal from AFC Bournemouth earlier this month, was lively but missed a big chance when he shot straight at Hermansen shortly before Vardy's equaliser.

The Brazilian made his much-anticipated comeback as a substitute after serving a four-game ban and netted the goal that put the contest beyond the visitors at Molineux. Wolves are up to 16th in the table and 14 points clear of the bottom three with just six games remaining. The Algerian's strike was Wolves’ earliest Premier League goal ever from the start of a game, a record previously held by Pablo Sarabia (109 seconds v Southampton in November this season). Spurs almost gifted Wolves a second goal when Vicario's poor pass went straight to Marshall Munetsi, who found Strand Larsen, but he could only stab wide from close range. Richarlison gave the visitors hope once again when he headed in five minutes from time, but less than two minutes later, Cunha capitalised on some loose play from Lucas Bergvall before slotting home. Hungry like the Wolves\\nWolves have hit form at an ideal time to drag themselves away from danger and are now on the verge of mathematically confirming their Premier League status for 2025/26. Although Spurs grew into the game, fortune was definitely on Wolves’ side for the second goal, which gave them breathing space heading into half-time, and the only negatives from their first-half display were the losses of Bellegarde and Matt Doherty to injury. The visitors made the stronger start to the second half, but Tel’s goal sparked Wolves back into life, and their alertness led to them punishing Romero’s error for their third goal. In tucking away Ait-Nouri’s square pass, Strand Larsen became only the second Wolves player to score in four successive Premier League games, matching the feat of Henri Camara 21 years earlier. Cunha was subsequently introduced to a wonderful reception after four games out, and it did not take long for him to make an impact. Moments after Richarlison narrowed the gap again, Cunha stole the ball from Bergvall and burst away from Ben Davies, before calmly sending Vicario the wrong way. Wolves have now won four straight top-flight games for the first time since January 1972. First, Romero was robbed of possession inside his own penalty area, while Bergvall’s naïve play allowed the returning Cunha to run almost half the length of the field and put the result beyond doubt.

Mohamed Salah\\'s first-half penalty opened the scoring after Levi Colwill felled Jones, though Chelsea levelled shortly after the interval through a composed Nicolas Jackson finish.

Substitutes Renato Veiga and Christopher Nkunku both had half-chances late on, but it was substitute Luis Diaz who went closest to scoring a fourth goal as Liverpool took the spoils. Slot passes major test\\nLast month\\'s home defeat to Nottingham Forest remains the only blot on Slot\\'s Liverpool record since taking over from Jurgen Klopp and Sunday\\'s victory felt like a particularly important one. AFC Bournemouth – currently 10th after Saturday\\'s upset of Arsenal – were the highest-ranked team in the Premier League table to have been beaten by the Reds ahead of Chelsea\\'s visit, with three of the four teams still hunting a victory – Ipswich Town, Crystal Palace and Wolves – among Liverpool\\'s early-season opponents. If Liverpool are to challenge for the Premier League crown, they will have to prove they can do it against the division\\'s best, with Arsenal, Aston Villa and Man City among their next five opponents.

If Slot can mastermind similar performances against the rest of their direct rivals, fans will continue to leave Anfield happy. Captain Reece James returned from a lengthy spell out with a hamstring injury to play 53 minutes, looking lively as he went head-to-head with the man he will hope to challenge for an England starting spot, in Trent Alexander-Arnold. The midfield duo of Romeo Lavia and Caicedo – both of whom were coveted by Liverpool before moving to Stamford Bridge – also showed promise, with the former looking comfortable on his first start since the opening weekend and the latter sliding a fine pass through for Jackson\\'s goal.

The Seagulls began brightly enough with Yankuba Minteh just unable to turn home Adingra’s deep cross, while the latter also fired narrowly off target before Joao Pedro opened the scoring. Though they were pegged back before half-time, Brighton were soon back on top and restored their lead through another Joao Pedro penalty. However, Leicester refused to lie down and if anything, Brighton were grateful to end the game with a point, with their winless streak stretching to four matches. Brighton know they cannot afford to dwell on that for too long, though, as the battle for European football intensifies. Newcastle United and leaders Liverpool are still to come, though they are the only top-half sides the Seagulls will face in their seven remaining games.

In an entertaining contest that saw Ollie Watkins squander glorious chances in either half, Mikel Arteta’s side would hit the front in the 67th minute. Arsenal join Manchester City and Brighton & Hove Albion at the top with six points from their first two games, while Aston Villa are down in 12th. How the match unfolded\\nA cagey opening burst into life when Bukayo Saka registered the encounter's first meaningful attempt on target, striking from the edge of the area to force Emiliano Martinez into a smart save. Moments after going down with an injury, Leon Bailey sprung to his feet to force Gabriel Magalhaes into a mistake, allowing Morgan Rogers to play in Watkins, who uncharacteristically scuffed his effort wide. Villa thought they had taken the lead eight minutes after the restart when Amadou Onana’s effort deflected onto the crossbar, with the rebound falling for Watkins to head home, only for Raya to spring back up to save brilliantly. But against the run of play, Villa were caught out, as Trossard struck low into the bottom corner with the Gunners’ first attempt of the second period. Partey concluded the scoring in the 77th minute, curling an effort in at Martinez’s near post, although the Villa goalkeeper may feel he should have done better. Dynamic Villa lacking a clinical edge\\nAfter scoring 76 goals in the Premier League last season, Villa have so far failed to replicate the clinical showing that secured them their top-four finish. Emery’s side have managed just six shots on target from their 25 attempts in their two matches so far, but it was not through a lack of trying as they were denied by a combination of poor finishing and an inspired goalkeeping display. Watkins was tipped to challenge Man City’s Erling Haaland for the Premier League Golden Boot after an impressive showing at UEFA EURO 2024 but failed to find the net with the two golden opportunities presented to him. And despite the introductions of Jacob Ramsey and Jhon Duran, Villa struggled against last season's sternest defence, failing to take advantage of their impressive first-half showing. Rogers’ energetic display was a notable standout for the home side as he continues to make his mark under Emery’s guidance. Arteta overcomes Emery hoodoo\\nAfter seeing last season's title charge derailed by Emery’s side, when they lost 2-0 at Emirates Stadium in April, Arteta exempted revenge on his recent foes with a stylish, yet combative, display that highlighted their Premier League credentials this time around. A stop-start opening to the match threatened to restrict the Gunners’ attacking momentum, and had it not been for Villa’s wastefulness, they could have found themselves coming from a goal behind at Villa Park. The tide shifted towards the interval as Arsenal’s intricate passing failed to penetrate Villa’s stern rearguard, with Rogers proving to be a particular thorn in their side. However, Arteta’s side did not divert from the possession style of play that has brought them success in the division over the past two seasons, evident with Saka’s 63rd-minute effort after being found by Odegaard, only for Martinez to stand in his way.

Forest stumble again\\nWith the race for the Premier League top five in full swing, Nuno’s side still find themselves in pole position to secure qualify for the Champions League, but two losses on the bounce will have done nothing to ease any nerves. Nuno was able to welcome back Chris Wood from injury, but Anthony Elanga was only fit enough for the bench, and Forest lacked their usual zip in a sluggish performance, even after the latter was introduced in the second half. Nonetheless, Forest have a relatively kind run-in waiting them, with just one game against a current top-half side – when Chelsea visit the City Ground on the final matchday of the season – meaning that Nuno’s team should still fancy their chances of returning to Europe’s top table for the first time over four decades.

In a title race that looks set to be so tight, though, then there may not be any margin for error, and Guardiola will likely be hammering it into his players that next time out, they must rediscover that finishing touch to put games to bed. Haaland’s goal did not deter them from building up from the back, though they were almost undone when Ramsdale’s poor pass was picked off by Bernado Silva, but the resulting attack was well defended by Harwood-Bellis.

Welbeck keeps on firing\\nBrighton seemed to struggle to execute the final ball in their attacking moves in the first half, with Wolves’ low block proving resistant. A brilliant run in behind the Wolves defence allowed Rutter to play a throughball into his path, and he made no mistake to stroke home with confidence. Welbeck threatened again in the 62nd minute as he seized on Pablo Sarabia’s mistake at the back to surge into the box. O’Neil’s men still fighting \\nDoyle’s heroic interception to start the Wolves move for their equaliser epitomised the fight in O’Neil’s side. Faced with four Brighton forwards rushing towards him on the edge of his own box, the Englishman stepped forward to intercept as Wolves’ last man before starting an attack of his own. The outcome proved to be decisive as Cunha’s late equaliser doubled the visitors’ points tally this season. Wolves had come out resurgent after the break and slowly put pressure on a Brighton side that looked utterly dominant in the first half. When Ferguson fired in their second against the run of play five minutes from time, it would have been understandable to see Wolves’ spirit break. Ait-Nouri’s near-immediate response finally saw their pressure pay and gave them something to fight for, before Doyle’s intervention set Cunha free to finish the job. Wolves still remain second from bottom on just two points, but their effort today indicates a side still set on delivering for O’Neil.

      "{'Man City': \"Erling Haaland scored a hat-trick as Manchester City earned a resounding 4-1 triumph over Ipswich Town thanks largely to a barnstorming first-half blitz at the Etihad Stadium. But Haaland levelled from the spot just five minutes later and, after Kevin De Bruyne capitalised on Arijanet Muric's error, the striker had Pep Guardiola's men 3-1 in front with only 16 minutes on the clock. Haaland ensured he would take home the match ball by lashing in Man City’s fourth in the closing stages but the damage was already done by that devastating four-minute goal spree. City have now made it two wins from two, while Ipswich will hope to get off the mark against Fulham next weekend. Szmodics squeezing in the opener soon seemed a distant memory as City shellshocked the visitors. Haaland coolly converted the leveller from the spot after Leif Davis felled Savinho and the tricky winger harassed Muric into an error for De Bruyne to roll into an unguarded goal. De Bruyne then turned provider with an over-the-top ball that Haaland nodded past Muric and side-footed home. Rico Lewis and De Bruyne both hammered the crossbar and City's No 9 volleyed over in search of a hat-trick. Muric went some way to atoning for his earlier errors to prevent Haaland's thumping header from finding the top corner just after the hour. But there was little he could do when Haaland celebrated a seventh career Premier League hat-trick with an excellent low drive into the bottom-right corner from 20 yards in the 88th minute. Haaland the hat-trick hero as Savinho looks a big-time player\\nThe fact Haaland loves to score goals is unlikely to make headline news but, while this might be only his third season, his standing as one of the all-time great Premier League strikers is indisputable already. He was as clinical as ever to help City quickly recover from the early setback and his third goal was an effort of the absolute highest order in another display of lethal finishing. Haaland was given a standing ovation when he exited late on, a reception only matched by the appearance of returning hero Ilkay Gundogan in the 71st minute. Aside from Haaland, De Bruyne was at his mercurial best, while Mateo Kovacic knitted things together masterfully in midfield before an untimely injury early in the second half. The 20-year-old Brazilian was a constant menace and it was he who drew the foul that helped City restore parity after the early setback. Harsh lessons for Ipswich\\nThis fixture represented Ipswich's first visit to the Etihad and, like countless sides before them, they learned very quickly just how tough an assignment it is against this breathless City side. But the time it took the ball to trickle over the line felt longer than the time it took City to race into the lead, with Ipswich barely able to catch their breath. Muric, a former City player, dithered for far too long to gift the hosts their second and you wonder whether he might have been better standing his ground for the third, too.

      "{'Arsenal': '.', 'Everton': \"Arsenal’s Premier League title hopes hit another hurdle as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Everton’s stubborn rearguard at Emirates Stadium. Jordan Pickford was in fine form between the sticks for the Toffees, who also defended excellently to frustrate their hosts on Saturday. And other than a late penalty shout for a tackle by Vitalii Mykolenko on Thomas Partey, which was waved away by the referee with the decision upheld by VAR, Everton were able to keep any late drama to a minimum. The draw leaves Arsenal in third position, behind Liverpool and Chelsea, while Everton are 15th. How the match unfolded\\nEverton had the first big chance of the game, Abdoulaye Doucoure finding space inside the box but seeing his left-foot strike well blocked by Gabriel Magalhaes, though the Gunners swiftly established their dominance, with Gabriel Martinelli and Odegaard going close. Saka saw a shot blocked before teeing up the best opportunity of the half for Odegaard on the half-hour mark, the Norwegian producing a good save from Pickford with his strike, which took a deflection off James Tarkowski. Pickford had one more shot to save before the break, throwing out his left leg to stop Martinelli, and produced arguably his best save of the whole match when denying Saka's volley 59 seconds into the second period. He reacted fast again on the hour mark to kick away a dangerous Saka cross as Everton continued to thwart Mikel Arteta’s team. Arteta's side did cause Everton problems, particularly via the usual sources of Odegaard and Saka, with the two dovetailing to nice effect in the first half particularly. Substitutes Leandro Trossard, Gabriel Jesus and Ethan Nwaneri struggled to make the desired impact and Everton were able to limit the Gunners to little in the final stages. Pickford produces his best\\nPickford brought up his 300th Premier League appearance in Everton’s win over Wolves earlier this month, and the 30-year-old called on all of that experience to help Sean Dyche’s team come away with what could prove to be a valuable point in their bid to push themselves away from danger. But they were also going to require a flawless performance from their goalkeeper – and Pickford obliged. He commanded his area well as Everton, in the main, nullified Arsenal’s set-piece threat, with Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite excellent. And Pickford’s stop to keep out Saka's volley in the opening minute of the second half was particularly eye-catching. It summed up what was a very different Everton performance from the one they turned in in their last away game, when they were beaten 4-0 by Manchester United. Having kept four clean sheets in their last five league games, Dyche's side can perhaps begin to breathe a little easier.

      "{'Arsenal': '.', 'Brentford': \"Yoane Wissa cancelled out Thomas Partey's goal as Brentford salvaged a 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, pushing Liverpool closer to the Premier League title. Four days after beating Real Madrid 3-0 in the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal needed over an hour to break down Thomas Frank's stubborn visitors. Partey finished across Mark Flekken after the Gunners' midweek hero Declan Rice led a devastating counter-attack following a Brentford corner. But Wissa swivelled in a crowded penalty area to hook past former Brentford goalkeeper David Raya, and despite Mikel Arteta bringing Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard off the bench, Arsenal – who finished with 10 men due to an injury to Jorginho – were unable to find a winner. Brentford climb above Crystal Palace to go 11th in the table. How the match unfolded\\nBrentford made an assured start, though Arsenal carved out the first half-chance when Gabriel Martinelli's dink was smothered by Flekken. Arsenal's first shot on target did not arrive until the 41st minute, when Flekken turned Rice's drive away, then the visiting goalkeeper produced a better save from Leandro Trossard's 20-yard effort. Raya fed Rice after claiming a Bryan Mbeumo corner, and the midfielder drove forward before teeing up Partey for a thumping finish. Brentford, though, were only behind for 13 minutes. Michael Kayode's dinked cross was headed back across goal by Nathan Collins, and Wissa improvised brilliantly to finish on the turn. This match featured two teams known for their set-piece prowess, and Brentford were certainly tested from dead balls. They did, however, catch Brentford cold from a corner at the other end. After gathering Mbeumo's delivery, Raya showed great awareness to bowl the ball out to Rice, who carried it from the edge of one penalty area to the other for his assist. But after half clearing another Mbeumo set-piece, Arsenal were slow to get out and were promptly punished. They were physically outmatched as Collins kept the ball alive, and Raya was left flapping at Wissa's finish. Brentford on the right lines\\nBrentford arrived at the Emirates having won five of their last six away Premier League matches, and that form translated into a confident start as they moved the ball well. The Bees got particular joy down their right-hand side, with Ajer flying forward to test Raya with an angled drive in the 22nd minute. It was his intelligent run and hanging cross that led to Wissa's equaliser, while he also made a potentially goal-saving challenge to deny Saka almost straight from the restart. Arteta felt Brentford could have been reduced to 10 men in the first half as Christian Norgaard chopped Martinelli down with a scissor-like challenge, but referee Simon Hooper and the VAR deemed the foul was only worthy of a yellow card. Ultimately, Arsenal could have no complaints at Brentford taking a deserved point. After back-to-back draws against two of the league’s top-five teams in the form of the Gunners and Chelsea, Frank's side host Brighton & Hove Albion next.

Former Leicester winger Harvey Barnes added a third as the Foxes became the first English team to lose eight successive home matches without scoring a goal. While Newcastle with one game in hand, go one point clear of Manchester City and are only behind Chelsea on goal difference, Leicester stay 15 points adrift of 17th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers, with only 21 points to play for. How the match unfolded\\nJamie Vardy worked Nick Pope after just 10 seconds, but Newcastle hit the front in the second minute when Tino Livramento crossed for the unmarked Murphy to convert. Schar spotted Mads Hermansen off his line and hit the crossbar with an audacious shot from beyond the halfway line, but Murphy collected the loose ball and poked home. Newcastle sliced through Leicester with ease as Alexander Isak shot wide, and they had their third goal in the 34th minute, Barnes tapping in after Hermansen parried Joelinton's effort. A Patson Daka shot struck both posts and bounced back to Pope amid a suspicion of offside against Vardy late in the first half, in Leicester's best opening of the game. Newcastle's tempo dropped after half-time, but Hermansen almost gifted them a fourth goal when he passed straight to Schar, immediately atoning by parrying the defender's shot. Leicester had something to celebrate when 15-year-old Jeremy Monga came on for his Premier League debut, but they failed to score once again as Wout Faes sent a late header wide. Leicester sinking without trace\\nRuud van Nistelrooy had promised Leicester would fight until the end ahead of this match, but fight was in short supply from them here, at least when defending. It was a similar story for the third goal, with Leicester's backline slow to react to Hermansen's parry. Leicester attempted to offer some consolation in attack, but things would not fall for them. Daka had their best effort as the flag went up against Vardy, and replays suggested that tight call might have been subject to a VAR check, had Daka found the net. Leicester's brightest moment came when Monga was introduced, becoming the second-youngest player to appear in the Premier League, after Ethan Nwaneri on his 2022 debut. But that was as good as it got as Leicester became the first team in Football League history to lose eight successive home league matches without scoring.

Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski then added a quickfire double, before Pape Sarr struck in the 25th minute against a struggling Southampton defence. Despite an improved second half, Southampton remain bottom of the Premier League, while Spurs move up to 10th, just five points off the top four. Sarr’s clever footwork then opened up Southampton’s defence for the fourth time as he side-stepped his marker to slot home, with some home fans heading for the exit in response. The visitors took their foot off the gas after the break as Southampton showed some character, but they were denied a late consolation as Mateus Fernandes had strayed into an offside position. Unholy night for Saints\\nSome of the Southampton faithful had already left their seats by the time Spurs eased into their 4-0 lead, reflecting a nightmare evening that was over having barely begun. As Spurs scored at will, some minds were doubtless even drifting back to October 2019 and February 2021, when the Saints were beaten 9-0 by Leicester City and Manchester United respectively. If they had not already – Maddison scoring the visitors' fifth just before half-time – a goal Russell Martin missed having headed back to the dressing room to prepare a difficult team talk – may well have provoked the same sense of doom that defined those previous beatings. While Martin's side were carved open too easily, they do at least deserve credit for the way heads did not drop during the second period. This match must quickly be eradicated from Southampton minds, but that spirit must be maintained to give them a chance of recovering from it. By the time Sarr had danced through Southampton’s defence, the result was no longer in doubt, and any lingering worries Spurs fans may have had about their recent slump in form were long gone as their dominance was rewarded.

Another former Arsenal player – Smith Rowe, a summer signing from the Gunners – opened his Fulham account when he broke the deadlock in the 18th minute. Wout Faes headed home an equaliser before half-time, but the hosts’ dominance ultimately paid off when Iwobi raced through to finish underneath Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. Leicester have one point from their opening two games, and sit 14th, three places behind Fulham in the early standings. How the match unfolded\\nIt was a fast start from Fulham with Hermansen forced to push wide Adama Traore’s left-footed strike before collecting Iwobi’s low shot inside the opening 10 minutes. And Fulham were rewarded for their positive play when Traore led a swift attack and found Smith Rowe in space. Despite the hosts’ impressive first-half showing, though, Leicester were able to draw level before the interval when Faes rose highest from a corner to head past Bernd Leno. But Fulham continued to dominate proceedings following the restart and after missed chances from Rodrigo Muniz and Kenny Tete, Iwobi made no such mistake. Antonee Robinson’s pass found Iwobi in-behind the Leicester defence, and he cooly squeezed the ball beyond Hermansen for the winner. Smith Rowe makes his mark\\nDespite an opening day defeat at Manchester United, Silva decided to name an unchanged starting line-up. Smith Rowe has arrived from Arsenal with lots of promise and the home faithful will have been delighted to have seen him get off the mark so early in his Fulham career. A lack of cutting edge from then on in may concern Silva, but Iwobi ultimately came up with the goods. The Cottagers have recruited well following the departures of some key players, and should be looking for more than just mid-table and safety this term. Despite being indebted to their goalkeeper and determined defending, with only Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s long-range effort testing Leno in Fulham’s goal, the Foxes stunned Craven Cottage with a surprise equaliser before half-time.

Nicolas Jackson’s strike proved decisive in Sunday’s west London derby at Stamford Bridge, where Marc Cucurella was sent off after full-time. It was Cucurella who put Chelsea in front in the 43rd minute, heading home at the end of a first half that the Blues had mostly dominated. After squandering a golden chance to double Chelsea’s advantage on the hour, Jackson atoned with a neat finish 10 minutes from time. Bryan Mbeumo dragged Brentford – who had earlier hit the crossbar – back into it in the final minute of normal time, but it was too little too late for the 11th-placed Bees, while Chelsea are now just two points behind Liverpool, who do have a match in hand. How the match unfolded\\nJackson went close twice early on, first glancing wide from Malo Gusto’s cross before stinging the palms of Mark Flekken with a rasping drive. Flekken stood firm again to thwart Enzo Fernandez, this time stretching out a foot to keep out the Argentinian’s shot, before he denied Noni Madueke as the winger surged through on goal. Jackson skied an effort over after great work from Jadon Sancho on the hour mark, and Chelsea would have paid for that miss if not for Robert Sanchez – who kept out Christian Norgaard’s hooked volley – and the crossbar, which Fabio Carvalho struck from close range before Kevin Schade put the rebound over. Jackson made amends when he steered beyond Flekken to grab an insurance goal Chelsea ultimately required. Maresca’s men the main challengers?\\nWith Arsenal dropping points at home to Everton and Manchester City losing to Manchester United, Chelsea were the only one of the teams most likely to mount a title challenge that managed to win this weekend. Despite head coach Enzo Maresca insisting that his side are not in the title race, a fifth straight league win, and one that came about in hard-fought fashion, will do little to temper the expectations of excitable Chelsea fans. Chelsea dominated large parts of the match but ended up holding on for the win after wasting numerous openings to make it far more comfortable, but there were plenty of positives to take. Sancho also continued his fine recent run of form, dovetailing nicely with Cole Palmer in central areas while also setting up that gilt-edged chance that Jackson wasted at 1-0.

Liverpool remain 11 points ahead of Arsenal, while Fulham move up to eighth, having provided a major boost to their European hopes. How the match unfolded\\nThe Reds took the lead against the run of play when Mac Allister held off Sander Berge and put his laces through an unstoppable long-range shot, but Fulham soon flipped the script. Curtis Jones blocked Andreas Pereira’s first-time cross from the right, but it bounced kindly for Sessegnon, who volleyed past Caoimhin Kelleher at his near post. Another defensive lapse gifted Fulham the lead. Andy Robertson gave the ball to Iwobi on the edge of the box, and he fired past Kelleher with the help of a deflection off the left-back. After Iwobi recycled a corner, Muniz expertly turned Virgil van Dijk to work the space to send a low shot through Kelleher's legs. Diogo Jota’s attempted dink early in the second half was smothered by Bernd Leno, but the goalkeeper would be beaten in the 72nd minute, when Conor Bradley teed up Diaz for a prodded finish.

Liverpool may have landed the first blow on the scoresheet, but Fulham started better. Just five minutes in, they wanted a penalty when a sprawling Kelleher felled Pereira after Ibrahima Konate lost the ball, but the decision not to award a spot-kick was checked and cleared by the VAR. Iwobi was the standout for Silva’s side and could have had a first-half hat-trick, having also forced a fine Kelleher save after cutting inside from the left before sending a long-range strike into the goalkeeper’s arms. Fulham clung on to win back-to-back home matches in the Premier League for the first time since March 2024, and Silva will be determined to build on that momentum against fellow European hopefuls AFC Bournemouth next time out.

The hosts staged a first-half comeback to stun Arne Slot’s side after Alexis Mac Allister opened the scoring with a brilliant long-range strike. A much-improved Liverpool searched for a way back, with substitute Luis Diaz offering them hope by reducing the deficit, but they could not find a late equaliser. Liverpool remain 11 points ahead of Arsenal, while Fulham move up to eighth, having provided a major boost to their European hopes. How the match unfolded\\nThe Reds took the lead against the run of play when Mac Allister held off Sander Berge and put his laces through an unstoppable long-range shot, but Fulham soon flipped the script. Liverpool’s defensive collapse was complete in the 37th minute. After Iwobi recycled a corner, Muniz expertly turned Virgil van Dijk to work the space to send a low shot through Kelleher's legs. Liverpool continued to push in the dying moments, with former Fulham player Harvey Elliott sending a curling effort against the crossbar, but they could not force an equaliser. Liverpool may have landed the first blow on the scoresheet, but Fulham started better. They did not let their heads drop after Mac Allister’s goal and their proactive approach was soon rewarded, with some help from Liverpool’s shaky defence. The hosts had to drop deeper as Liverpool forced the issue in the second half, but they defended their penalty area expertly and got a slice of fortune when Elliott struck the bar. Reds falter on the road\\nAfter rivals Everton did Liverpool a favour by drawing with Arsenal on Saturday, it left the Reds needing just four wins to wrap up the Premier League title. Van Dijk may claim there was a foul by Muniz in the build-up to the third, but it was an inspired touch from the Brazilian to flick it over his marker. The Reds dominated the second half, but Mohamed Salah struggled to make a mark, blazing over the bar from close range moments after Robertson had rifled over instead of picking out the unmarked Egyptian. Diaz eventually gave Liverpool a lifeline, but Elliott's curler was the closest they came to a leveller.

Cunha scored in both of those wins, and played a part in Wolves' opener after winning the right-sided free-kick that Ait-Nouri rolled short for Hwang to score. The Brazilian forward fired just wide from long distance shortly after Wolves' set-piece issues had been exposed once more for Bentancur's equaliser, and those troubles were almost punished again when Dragusin nodded narrowly off target. Cunha's long-range strike narrowly evaded the top-left corner with the scores level, though Wolves had no answer to a barrage of pressure that brought Son's penalty failure before Johnson's routine finish from close range. Cunha's injury meant Larsen came on, and that change paid off when the towering striker scored late on, while Wolves could have stolen all three points if not for Forster keeping out Matt Doherty's late header. Strand Larsen's introduction serves a timely reminder of the attacking talent at Pereira's disposal but defensive issues – largely from set-pieces – need correcting ahead of Wolves hosting in-form Nottingham Forest at Molineux next Monday.

While Everton never truly looked like getting a winner, Moyes will be delighted with the way they battled for their point in the second half. Arteta insisted on Friday he would not look past Everton, but captain Odegaard joined Saka and Martinelli on the bench at Goodison as the manager rotated his squad. Trossard's pace and clever movement brought a more fluid look to the Arsenal attack, and he had already drawn a goal-saving challenge from Branthwaite before he opened the scoring.

Slot waited just 13 minutes for his first home match to spark into life – Diogo Jota leading a rapid counter-attack from a Brentford corner before laying it off to Diaz, who lashed in beyond Mark Flekken to mark his 100th Reds appearance in style.

The Dutchman is the first Liverpool manager since Graeme Souness in April 1991 to win his first two league fixtures in charge, and in the moments his team really clicked through the gears in front of a record crowd for a league match at Anfield, they looked superb. There were a few slack moments defensively that could worry Slot, including when Robertson bundled over Bryan Mbeumo in the box, only for the offside flag to spare the full-back’s blushes, but some of Liverpool’s attacking play was delightful. Indeed, the move of the match involved Salah cutting in from the right and combining wonderfully with Jota and Alexis Mac Allister, with the Egyptian just unable to apply the finish. The opener was the perfect example of the \"heavy metal football\" that brought Liverpool such success under their former manager, while their second came about because of some relentless pressing, great vision from Diaz, and a touch of class from talisman Salah.

How the match unfolded\\nDiaz’s thumping finish got the ball rolling early for Liverpool, with Flekken denying Andrew Robertson a quickfire second. Brentford’s goalkeeper thwarted Robertson again just after the break, making an unorthodox stop with his face to keep out the defender’s close-range attempt, though the hosts had Alisson to thank when he parried away Ajer’s header off the line at the other end. Liverpool responded in force – Nathan Collins did brilliantly to deny Jota a certain goal, before Dominik Szoboszlai struck a post directly from a corner and Ibrahima Konate headed at Flekken, who then got to a low Diaz effort. But Flekken could do little to prevent Salah tucking home following some quick thinking from Diaz, while only the crossbar prevented substitute Cody Gakpo adding a third in the closing stages. There were a few slack moments defensively that could worry Slot, including when Robertson bundled over Bryan Mbeumo in the box, only for the offside flag to spare the full-back’s blushes, but some of Liverpool’s attacking play was delightful. Toney situation needs a resolution\\nBrentford are certainly open to selling Toney, and it appears his future may soon be resolved, with reports suggesting Saudi Pro League team Al-Ahli are close to reaching an agreement with the Bees. The 28-year-old’s absence was not felt when Brentford beat Crystal Palace last time out, but against the very top teams the Premier League has to offer, the lack of a striker of Toney’s calibre was more apparent. With less than a week left in the window, Thomas Frank will surely want the situation to come to a head one way or the other so Brentford can, if needed, reinvest the funds in a quality replacement before Friday’s transfer deadline, especially with Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Man Utd to come in their next three Premier League away matches. Mbeumo was a livewire up front, but there was no clinical edge to Brentford’s play – the kind of edge that Toney has previously brought to the table in abundance. Club reports\\nLiverpool report | Brentford report\\nKey facts\\nSlot became only the third manager to win both of his first two top-flight matches in charge of Liverpool while seeing his side also keep a clean sheet in each, after Matt McQueen in 1923 and Graeme Souness in 1991.

Iliman Ndiaye added further gloss late on as Everton surged above Tottenham Hotspur into 15th place, nine points clear of 17th-placed Leicester. This was the Toffees' third league win in a row - the first time they have achieved such a run this season. How the match unfolded\\nEverton made a dream start as Leicester failed to deal with Jordan Pickford’s long ball, allowing Doucoure to burst into the box and drill home. Beto, in for the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin, exposed the Foxes' high line to latch on to a weighted pass by James Tarkowski and arrow a first-time finish across Mads Hermansen into the bottom-left corner. With the hard work done, Everton kept Leicester at arm’s length after the restart, though Jesper Lindstrom should have done better when he struck at Hermansen from close range. Moyes working his magic\\nEverton were forced to dig deep to grind out three points against Brighton last week, but this was a far more assured performance, aided by two rapid goals. Doucoure and Beto’s goals inside the first six minutes marked the earliest the Toffees had scored two goals in a Premier League match. Unlike in their last home match, when they were made to hold on to claim a 3-2 win over Spurs, Everton never looked likely to slip up as they aimed to further ease any relegation concerns. Moyes was forced to reshuffle his pack, due to the injuries Calvert-Lewin and Orel Mangala sustained at Brighton, but he will be delighted with the performances from their replacements. Beto is, as it stands, Everton’s only fit striker, but he proved a handful through his endeavour and took both of his goals confidently. He hassled and pressed out of possession, but showed plenty of class on the ball, including a superb assist for Everton’s third goal. Next up is an FA Cup tie against Bournemouth, before Everton return to Premier League action against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby. They set the tone for Doucoure’s opener, with Boubakary Soumare failing to deal with Pickford’s punt, and the centre-backs behind him allowing Doucoure the freedom of the penalty area. Leicester's workmanlike midfield were distinctly second-best throughout and their struggles in progressing the ball up the pitch meant it took them until the 73rd minute to register their only shot on target, with Pickford saving easily from Patson Daka.

After losing Kai Havertz to a season-ending injury, Mikel Arteta went without a recognised forward at the King Power Stadium, where the visitors ultimately required a superb-sub cameo from midfielder Merino. Leicester remain in the bottom three, two points from safety. How the match unfolded\\nAn uneventful first half saw little goalmouth action, with Wilfred Ndidi’s volley from the edge of the box comfortably gathered by David Raya. Though Arsenal dominated possession, Ndidi again went close just before the break, sending his header wide having been brilliantly picked out by Victor Kristiansen’s wicked delivery. The visitors improved after half-time and almost edged ahead through the impressive Nwaneri, who flicked the crossbar with a thumping effort before he saw another fine attempt tipped onto the right-hand post by Mads Hermansen. Nwaneri turned provider with a delicately lofted delivery from the right, with the Spain international directing his header out of Hermansen’s reach. Arsenal were caught offside four times before the break, as they struggled to break down Leicester. Foxes left reeling after another late show\\nAfter going down to Manchester United in contentions fashion in the FA Cup last week, Leicester were once again undone in the closing stages, denying them what might have proved a vital point in their fight to stay up. Ayew almost gave the Foxes supporters something to cheer inside the opening minute after breaking in behind the Arsenal defence, before Ndidi’s volley was stopped by Raya. Ndidi should have done better with his headed opportunity late in the first half, but in Leicester’s quest for the opening goal, they left themselves exposed at the back, and they were eventually undone by two moments of quality. Despite a positive display in many ways, with Arsenal limited to few clear chances, it was another disappointing result for Ruud van Nistelrooy’s team, who welcome Brentford to the King Power Stadium in their next Premier League outing.

After scoring a treble against Ipswich Town last week, Haaland took his tally to seven goals for 2024/25 at the London Stadium. The Norwegian produced a composed one-on-one finish for the opener before arrowing a powerful strike home for his second on the half-hour mark, after a Ruben Dias own goal had briefly dragged West Ham level. Mohammed Kudus went close to a second West Ham equaliser after the interval, but Haaland wrapped up the points with another breakaway finish with seven minutes to play.

Kevin De Bruyne then rattled the post as City dominated, but West Ham levelled out of nowhere with 19 minutes gone. Jarrod Bowen got to the byline to cross, with his delivery hitting Dias and creeping beyond Ederson. City were back in the ascendancy on the half-hour mark, though, with Haaland putting a brilliant finish past Alphonse Areola after being teed up by Rico Lewis. West Ham almost struck on the counter-attack again after the restart, but Kudus could only blast his effort off the near post after scampering away down the left. West Ham almost pulled one back through Crysencio Summerville at the death, but Ederson pushed his curling effort onto a post and to safety. Fresh from scoring a hat-trick in last week's comeback victory over Ipswich, Haaland was at his ruthless best at the London Stadium following an early sighter that saw him head Silva's dinked cross off target. His second goal was something special, with the striker firing into the top-right corner with no backlift to give Areola no chance. His third, meanwhile, showed a touch of class not always associated with the Norwegian powerhouse, a cultured dink killing any faint hopes of a West Ham comeback. West Ham come up short\\nDespite a second defeat in two home league matches under Lopetegui, there were positives for West Ham to take on Saturday. Even at 2-1 down early in the second half, West Ham had their moments on the break, not least when Kudus showed electric pace to escape his marker and leave the goal frame shaking with a powerful effort.

The Villa Park faithful were treated to two goals in two minutes early in the first half, with Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen putting them 2-0 up after 15 minutes. A much-improved second-half performance from Forest led to half-time substitute Jota Silva halving the deficit after he neatly turned Villa’s defence to pick out the far corner.

Anthony Elanga almost recreated his wonderful midweek solo goal against Man United shortly after those two goals, only to drag wide after a marauding run, while Callum Hudson-Odoi’s strike from the right of the box also rolled past Emiliano Martinez’s far post. Villa ride the storm\\nVilla picked up where they left off after the international break with two comfortable wins in the FA Cup and Premier League, but things were not quite so smooth ahead of a big week. With a Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday looming, Emery rung the changes, but Villa made the best start possible by throwing everything they had at Forest. Rogers had been a doubt heading into this game, having limped off against Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday, but he showed no signs of injury as he ghosted in behind to reach Youri Tielemans’ pass. After Malen struck his second goal in two games for Villa, it looked like the hosts were cruising, with Martinez forced into little work in the first half. Emery had some tricks up his own sleeve, though, and the momentum swung back in their favour, with Marco Asensio and Tielemans denied by Sels, who did brilliantly to smother Rashford’s late chance before clawing away the rebound. Next up in the league for Villa is a trip to Southampton, who may be relegated by the time the match is played. Forest have received plaudits this season for their defensive stability, but they were uncharacteristically shaky in the opening stages and had already got away with one when Asensio drilled wide before the two quickfire Villa goals.

Bournemouth thought they had a penalty when Antoine Semenyo was brought down at the other end, but the on-field decision was overturned following a VAR review. Tenth-placed Bournemouth have now lost four of their last five league games, in a further blow to their European hopes, while 18th-placed Ipswich are nine points from safety. How the match unfolded\\nThe Cherries have developed a reputation for racing out of the blocks this season, but they had to wait until the 32nd minute to register their first shot on target as Semenyo struck powerfully at Alex Palmer. Bournemouth thought they had a lifeline when Axel Tuanzebe brought down Semenyo on the edge of the area, but contact was deemed to have occurred outside the box. Andoni Iraola’s team pulled one back as Evanilson tucked home after Palmer parried Lewis Cook’s effort, but Bournemouth could not forge a comeback. Bournemouth’s stumble becomes a slump\\nBournemouth would have hoped to bounce back strongly following their FA Cup elimination at the hands of Manchester City on Sunday, but their poor run of form persisted with another Premier League defeat. The Cherries have hit a rough patch in recent weeks, coming into this match with three losses in their last four league games after having lost just three of their previous 18 matches. The Cherries looked a shadow of themselves early on, with Ipswich controlling the tempo. And when Bournemouth finally did create those chances through Semenyo and Scott, they left the door open at the other end and were duly punished. Iraola now faces a crucial test to get his side back on track as Bournemouth travel to West Ham United on Saturday, with their European ambitions threatening to fall away.

      "{'Chelsea': \"Chelsea returned to the top four of the Premier League table as Enzo Fernandez's header sealed a 1-0 London derby win over Tottenham Hotspur. Fernandez powered home following an outstanding cross from the returning Cole Palmer in the 50th minute, as the Blues earned a deserved three points at Stamford Bridge. Moises Caicedo and Pape Sarr had second-half strikes disallowed, but Spurs could have few complaints about the result, having earlier relied on Guglielmo Vicario to keep Chelsea out. After several of their rivals for UEFA Champions League qualification won in midweek, the victory moves Chelsea to fourth place on 52 points, back above Manchester City and Newcastle United. How the match unfolded\\nNicolas Jackson could have put Chelsea ahead in the first minute, but Vicario denied him with his legs before Micky van de Ven turned the loose ball against his own post. Vicario denied Palmer early in the second half, but that was a momentary reprieve for Spurs as Palmer drifted wide to cross, and Fernandez arrived unmarked to head home. Chelsea thought they had a second goal when Caicedo sent a thumping volley past Vicario, but the decision to award the goal was overturned following a VAR review, with Levi Colwill found to be offside in the build-up. Another VAR intervention went the other way, in favour of Caicedo, with 20 minutes to play. Spurs substitute Sarr rifled home from 25 yards out, but after a pitchside review, referee Craig Pawson ruled he had fouled the Chelsea midfielder. Spurs' best chance to level fell to Son late on, but he failed to beat Sanchez on the slide as Chelsea successfully navigated 12 minutes of second-half stoppage time. Palmer instigates Chelsea improvement\\nChelsea went into the international break with three defeats in five Premier League games, and midweek wins for Nottingham Forest, Man City, Newcastle and Aston Villa did nothing to ease the pressure on the Blues. Enzo Maresca was boosted by the returns of Jackson and Palmer, but the latter was slow to get going in the first half, with his only major involvement coming when his inviting ball across the six-yard box was scrambled clear by Destiny Udogie. However, Palmer played a crucial role when Chelsea finally made their dominance count after half-time. Seconds after his 20-yard drive was parried by Vicario, Palmer received a simple pass from Marc Cucurella near the touchline and swung a magnificent cross onto the head of Fernandez, who could not miss. That assist was Palmer's first Premier League goal involvement since scoring in a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth in mid-January, eight games ago. Palmer's drop in form certainly did not help Chelsea's European aspirations, but after using the international break to recover and recharge, he will hope to get back to his best in the run-in. Spurs struggle again at Stamford Bridge\\nSpurs also received a major boost on the injury front. Having struggled with a hamstring injury, Van de Ven made his first Premier League start since the reverse fixture against Chelsea, a dramatic 4-3 defeat in December. Spurs seemed to lack physicality in midfield as Fernandez and Caicedo bossed proceedings, and only the reflexes of Vicario kept them level by the break. Things were not much better in attack, where former Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke was isolated and failed to attempt a single shot.

Watkins has now gone eight matches without registering a league goal for Villa, his worst run under Emery, but in the end it was not costly as the visitors held on for all three points and a valuable win to bounce back from the loss to Arsenal, capping an exciting week where they also discovered their upcoming UEFA Champions League opponents. Villa have now won two of their three Premier League matches and look in fine form as they hope for another successful campaign, and there is a reasonable fixture list to look forward to after the international break, with encounters against Everton, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town up next.

Hutchinson and Davis also impressed for the hosts, with the former going close to stroking the ball home for a memorable three points at the death, but it wasn’t meant to be.

Man City will be without Erling Haaland for up to seven weeks due to an ankle injury, but the absence of their leading goalscorer proved only a minor inconvenience on Wednesday night. Man City were unable to further extend their lead despite dominating throughout, but the victory takes them above Chelsea, who face Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday. How the match unfolded\\nMan City needed less than two minutes to go ahead. Following Jeremy Doku's driving run, Savinho's intelligent cutback found Grealish, and he side-footed home. Bilal El Khannouss curled just wide to cap a rare Leicester foray, but City scored their second goal in the 29th minute. City continued to monopolise possession after the break, with talented youngster Nico O'Reilly seeing an outside-of-the-boot attempt blocked by Faes. Marmoush perhaps should have put City 3-0 up when he turned Doku's cutback over on the hour mark, but for the most part the hosts were content to simply play in front of Leicester. It all amounted to a routine success for Pep Guardiola's team, who avoided a slip-up in the race for UEFA Champions League qualification. Man City share the load\\nWith Haaland likely to miss at least four more Premier League games with the ankle injury he suffered in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth, several Man City attackers have a chance to stake a claim for a regular starting spot. Since Haaland arrived in 2022, City had only lost two of the 15 league matches that he had missed, so they have shown an ability to cope without him. Marmoush led the line here, and he followed up his winner at Vitality Stadium with a crashing finish to put City two goals up – his fifth goal in eight Premier League games. He repaid Guardiola's faith with his first goal in the competition in over a year, lpreviously netting in a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace in December 2023. Another positive was O'Reilly making his first Premier League start, and the 20-year-old produced a composed performance just three days after assisting both goals in Man City's quarter-final triumph. City still have plenty to play for in the league and the cup, so Guardiola will be delighted to see some members of his supporting cast step up. Toothless Foxes beaten again\\nA trip to the Etihad Stadium always appeared a daunting prospect for Leicester, who had lost 13 of their last 14 Premier League games and fell 12 points adrift of the dotted line when Wolves beat West Ham United 1-0 on Tuesday.

When captain Jamie Vardy was replaced by Oliver Skipp in a defensive half-time change, it was clear the visitors were playing a game of damage limitation. Vardy only had eight touches before coming off, as he failed to make his mark. El Khannouss's early curler was one of just two shots attempted by Leicester, and they have now lost their last seven Premier League games in a row, all to nil.

Idrissa Gueye fired over from just inside the box, while Jack Harrison dragged an effort wide of the target. The hosts broke through five minutes after the restart when Calvert-Lewin cushioned Harrison’s cross into the path of Keane, who drilled home superbly from 12 yards out. Everton doubled their lead soon after as Calvert-Lewin rounded off another neat exchange of passes by latching onto Dwight McNeil’s through ball, and calmly lifting over Kepa. Everton went close to increasing their lead, but Bournemouth pulled a goal back three minutes from time when Semenyo turned in Dango Ouattara’s deep cross. Another deep centre – this time from Sinisterra – was met by the head of Cook in the 92nd minute, while Jordan Pickford denied Marcus Tavernier and Semenyo soon after.

Toffees’ August blues continue\\nNot since beating Brighton & Hove Albion in 2021 had Everton tasted a Premier League victory in the month of August, now stretching back 11 matches. After conceding seven goals without reply in their opening two matches, the Toffees enjoyed a reprieve with the comfortable Carabao Cup win over Doncaster Rovers in midweek. Sean Dyche’s side appeared to have carried that momentum into today’s game, and the Goodison Park faithful certainly responded to them. Indeed, Keane opened the scoring on his 200th Everton start, while Calvert-Lewin marked his 250th appearance by doubling the lead.

The result edged Liverpool’s advantage over second-placed Arsenal to eight points, having played one match more, while Villa stay in ninth, five points adrift of the top four. How the match unfolded\\nLiverpool edged ahead in the 29th minute when Garcia’s poor pass to Emiliano Martinez was gathered by Diogo Jota, who raced into the area and squared for Salah to fire home. But Villa dragged themselves level after Liverpool failed to deal with Marcus Rashford’s teasing free-kick, with Dominik Szoboszlai’s clearing header met by Tielemans’ first-time volley. Watkins then headed the hosts ahead in the third minute of first-half stoppage time, guiding Lucas Digne’s cross with a fine header beyond the grasp of Alisson Becker. Liverpool, however, restored parity just after the hour when Alexander-Arnold’s strike from the edge of the area deflected off Tyrone Mings and over Martinez’s dive. Slot left to rue missed opportunities\\nLiverpool’s title credentials were questioned after their nervy win over Wolverhampton Wanderers last time out, and their inability to finish their chances proved costly at Villa Park. Curtis Jones then brilliantly slipped in Szoboszlai but saw his strike smothered by Martinez, with their glut of opportunities ruthlessly punished by Villa in the final 10 minutes of the half. Perhaps a pivotal moment in the contest was sandwiched between Tielemans and Watkins’ goals. Jota, who had earlier thrashed a volley wide of the mark, was played in behind barely a minute after Villa had levelled. Normally so composed in front of goal, the Liverpool forward uncharacteristically skewed his effort high and wide when faced one-on-one with Martinez. A point to build on for the Villans\\nHaving drawn four of their last six Premier League matches, Villa have seen their push for the top four stutter, but their point against the leaders is something positive to build on. In the Premier League this term, only Southampton (17) have made more errors leading to goals than Unai Emery’s side (12), but their response to that early setback was emphatic. After being hit on the counter-attack in their defeat at Anfield earlier in the season, Villa struck Liverpool with two quickfire goals. Though Liverpool looked the more likely to add to their lead, Villa themselves had two excellent opportunities to snatch three points late on, with Morgan Rogers firing over the crossbar before substitute Malen rifled an effort narrowly wide.

Liverpool struck the crossbar through Jota before Alexander-Arnold’s equaliser, and despite their best efforts, could not find a way through.

Mbeumo opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time before doubling the lead halfway through the second period and Wissa then got on the scoresheet moments later to continue Brentford’s strong start to the campaign. Brentford sit in fifth place ahead of the first international break, while Southampton are second-bottom\\xa0of the league table with zero points. His opposite number Mark Flekken was also busy early on, saving Kyle Walker-Peters’ effort from a tight angle, before Joe Aribo looped a header onto the crossbar from the resulting corner. Wissa had a superb chance later in the first half but miscued his chip over the onrushing Ramsdale, and the visitors were then able to clear their lines. Bryan Mbeumo made no mistake on the rebound of a stinging low shot from Kevin Schade, which had smacked the post after defender Taylor Harwood-Bellis had been dispossessed in a perilous position. Schade had an opportunity to double Brentford’s lead after the start but couldn’t generate enough power on his header after a fabulous curling cross from the right by Mbeumo. The Cameroon international then doubled his and his side’s advantage in the 65th minute, finishing off a quick Bees move after the Southampton backline were once again dispossessed deep in their own half.

The Dane can also now look ahead to a new era without Toney. He will be a big loss, but Brentford proved they still have firepower up front in the form of Wissa and Mbeumo. They dovetailed devastatingly this afternoon, with Mbeumo bagging two goals for himself to take his total to three already for the season.

Nevertheless, Frank will be delighted by his side’s first three performances of the new season and six points secured, with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium their next opponent. Nevertheless, the nature of the first two goals will be of concern to Martin, with Harwood-Bellis and Jack Stephens both struggling to deal with Brentford’s press for the first two goals.

After a 10th defeat in their last 11 league matches, Leicester stay 19th, two points adrift of 17th-place Wolverhampton Wanderers, having played an additional game. How the match unfolded\\nLeicester had two huge early chances, but Mark Flekken stood tall at his near post to deny Woyo Coulibaly, then made a strong save from Jamie Vardy. Only a spectacular fingertip save from Mads Hermansen stopped Yehor Yarmoliuk from extending Brentford\\'s lead in the 69th minute after the substitute glanced Mbeumo\\'s cross goalwards. No home comforts for Leicester\\nRuud van Nistelrooy\\'s team have now lost six successive Premier League matches at the King Power by an aggregate score of 15-0. Leicester showed signs of life in attack early on, with Coulibaly bustling his way into the area to test Flekken, before Vardy rolled back the years with a darting run off the back of Ethan Pinnock. But a litany of defensive errors cost the Foxes again. Norgaard was unchallenged six yards out when he scored Brentford\\'s third, and Soumare teed up Carvalho\\'s fourth when he attempted to clear after Hermansen parried Mbeumo’s shot. With the Dutchman under increasing pressure, Leicester visit West Ham United on Thursday, before a daunting run of fixtures pits them against Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Brighton and Liverpool.

Three goals in the space of 15 first-half minutes put Thomas Frank\\'s Bees in command, with Yoane Wissa, Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard on target. Mikkel Damsgaard assisted the first two goals, picking out Wissa with an intelligent flick for the opener, before finding Mbeumo free in the area for a curled finish.

How the match unfolded\\nLeicester had two huge early chances, but Mark Flekken stood tall at his near post to deny Woyo Coulibaly, then made a strong save from Jamie Vardy. But Brentford soon got on top and broke through in the 17th minute. Damsgaard flicked a sumptuous outside-of-the-boot pass through for Wissa, whose shot bounced in. Ten minutes later, Mbeumo doubled Brentford\\'s lead with a curling strike from the right of the box, having been found by Damsgaard, who has now produced 10 assists this season, the most of any Brentford player in a single campaign in the competition. The Bees were in cruise control from there as Norgaard added a third when he nodded home Mbeumo\\'s free-kick. Only a spectacular fingertip save from Mads Hermansen stopped Yehor Yarmoliuk from extending Brentford\\'s lead in the 69th minute after the substitute glanced Mbeumo\\'s cross goalwards.

Norgaard was unchallenged six yards out when he scored Brentford\\'s third, and Soumare teed up Carvalho\\'s fourth when he attempted to clear after Hermansen parried Mbeumo’s shot. A newly appointed Van Nistelrooy had a watching brief for November\\'s return fixture at Brentford, which ended in a chastening 4-1 defeat, and there is little evidence of the defensive issues they displayed on that day being resolved. Bees buzzing after club record fourth away win in a row\\nIn the early stages of 2024/25, Brentford were imperious at the Gtech Community Stadium but could not buy a victory on the road. This victory was just as comprehensive as that one, with Frank\\'s team exerting total control after Wissa opened the scoring. Damsgaard added another assist for Mbeumo\\'s goal to cap his lively midfield performance, taking him to 10 for the season. Nottingham Forest, AFC Bournemouth and Fulham have all been tipped to upset the established order and push for European qualification this season, but Brentford have gone under the radar. Sitting just four points adrift of the top seven and with a home game against 14th-placed Everton up next on Wednesday, perhaps the Bees can also dare to dream.

But after Rice was sent off for two bookable offences early in the second half, the Seagulls – who themselves came into the match with a 100 per cent record – secured a point in the 58th minute when Joao Pedro slotted in from close range. With a numerical advantage, Brighton pushed hard for a winner in the closing stages but there was no late breakthrough at either end, meaning both sides remain unbeaten. Arsenal and Brighton each have seven points from a possible nine. How the match unfolded\\nMikel Arteta’s side quickly settled and established control of proceedings, with Saka and Martin Odegaard volleying the hosts’ best opportunities straight at Bart Verbruggen in the Brighton goal. Although the visitors grew into the contest with Kaoru Mitoma firing narrowly wide, they fell behind in the 38th minute as Saka outmuscled Lewis Dunk before feeding Havertz, who lifted the ball over the outrushing Verbruggen and into the net. Brighton took swift advantage of the extra man by equalising. Yankuba Minteh raced onto Dunk’s precise through ball and, after David Raya parried the shot, Joao Pedro – who had netted a late winner against Manchester United last week – was there to tuck away the rebound. Verbruggen denied both Havertz and Saka, but it was Brighton who asserted more control as full-time grew closer. The Germany international was set up by Saka’s clever ball and has now found the net in each of his last four appearances against Brighton. Indeed, after Joao Pedro’s prompt equaliser, Arteta would probably have taken a point. Buoyant Brighton secure share of spoils\\nLondon has not been a happy hunting ground for Brighton in recent times. The Seagulls failed to win on any of their seven Premier League visits to the capital last season. It looked like it could be another torrid trip in the early stages as Arsenal dominated possession before Brighton lost James Milner to injury in the 17th minute in a significant blow. However, after that stoppage Brighton did seem to settle into a rhythm that was only briefly interrupted by Havertz’s opener. The visitors deservedly grabbed their equaliser through Joao Pedro and, given the positive display they produced, they would be justified in counting themselves unfortunate not to be leaving with all three points. With a home fixture against Ipswich Town to come after the international break, Brighton will be feeling good and confident of extending their impressive start.

Saints’ sorry season continues\\nSouthampton and Ivan Juric were hoping to recapture some of the positive aspects of their second-half performance in the defeat to Bournemouth, and that was highlighted in the line-up, with Tyler Dibling and Leslie Ugochukwu handed starts after their fine displays off the bench last weekend. Dibling struggled to make an impact and Kamaldeen Sulemana, buoyed by his goal last weekend, only showed flashes of quality in the rare moments the Saints went forward.

Liverpool bounce back\\nThe international break came at a good time for Liverpool, with their hopes of completing a treble having evaporated in the space of a week. First, Paris Saint-Germain sent them out of the Champions League on penalties, and then Newcastle United beat the Reds in the EFL Cup final. This fixture against Everton provided an ideal opportunity for the Reds to get back on track, though their opponents generated the greater attacking threat during the first half, with the woodwork coming to their rescue and thwarting Beto.

Second-place Arsenal move nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday, while Fulham remain eighth, four points off the top four. How the match unfolded\\nThe Gunners were dealt a blow when Gabriel went down and was substituted with what appeared to be a hamstring injury in the 16th minute, though that did not derail a strong start, and Ethan Nwaneri tested Bernd Leno with a powerful volley. And Arsenal’s dominance finally told when Nwaneri cut back for Merino, who managed to set himself and then prod a strike beyond Leno, courtesy of a deflection. Raul Jimenez forced David Raya into action and Jurrien Timber was denied by Leno at the other end before Saka made it 2-0 just seven minutes after coming on, nodding in after Gabriel Martinelli flicked on Merino’s cross. Muniz squandered a golden chance to get Fulham back in the game as he headed wide in the 81st minute, though a rather scuffed finish from the Brazilian deep in stoppage time meant Arsenal – who also saw a Martinelli goal disallowed for offside – were forced to hold on at the end. Fulham fall flat\\nFulham would have been hoping to bounce back following Saturday’s FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace, and Marco Silva’s team went into this one having not lost in any of their last three league matches against Arsenal, picking up a win and two draws in that run. The Cottagers had only once had a better run avoiding defeat to the Gunners, going unbeaten in four games between May 2011 and November 2012, but they could not give the best account of themselves on this occasion. Muniz’s scampered shot made matters interesting late on, but before that he had wasted their best chance when he headed off-target following great work from former Arsenal playmaker Alex Iwobi. Fulham did improve in the second half, though lacked the necessary sharpness in front of goal, and they have now gone 32 games without a win at Arsenal in the league.

The Wales international, whose father David played for the Tractor Boys between 1997 and 2001, bagged a first-half double, while Djed Spence and Dejan Kulusevski were each on target late on to seal victory at Portman Road. Johnson was in the right place at the right time twice in the space of eight minutes to convert a pair of Son Heung-min assists, though Omari Hutchinson halved the deficit before the break with an impressive goal for the hosts. The result remained in the balance until the closing stages, when a deflected Spence shot and Kulusevski’s fine individual goal ultimately condemned Ipswich to a seventh defeat in eight home league matches. Kieran McKenna’s side remain 18th, but they are now five points from safety following Wolverhampton Wanderers’ surprise win at AFC Bournemouth. Ipswich may have felt hard done by to be two goals behind and they halved the deficit in the 36th minute when Kalvin Phillips stole possession and fed Jack Clarke, who cut the ball back for Hutchinson to sweep a brilliant first-time finish beyond Guglielmo Vicario. Spurs restored their two-goal lead in the 77th minute when Ipswich substitute Luke Woolfenden, who had a header ruled out for offside earlier on, deflected Spence’s shot beyond helpless home goalkeeper Alex Palmer after the Spurs full-back had been cleverly found by James Maddison. Ipswich\\'s lack of home comfort continues\\nThe only side yet to record a Premier League victory in 2025, Ipswich had been buoyed by their hard-earned 1-1 draw at Villa Park last weekend. But despite their promising start, Ipswich switched off at the other end, affording Son too much space down the left to tee up Johnson for both goals, from which point a costly defeat always looked likely. To their credit, the hosts recovered well – aided by Hutchinson’s well-taken goal – and finished the first half strongly, while carrying the greater attacking threat for large periods after the break as well. Ipswich’s bid to avoid the drop has not been helped by their home form. Since their only league win at Portman Road this season, against Chelsea in December, they have lost four matches in a row in front of their own fans by an aggregate score of 14-2. Ipswich are away to another under-pressure team in desperate need of momentum, Manchester United, on Wednesday. Johnson haunts father’s former club\\nAround this time 25 years ago, David Johnson’s goals were instrumental towards Ipswich sealing their return to the Premier League. Given their knack of surrendering points from winning positions this season, Spurs will not have been sitting comfortably after Hutchinson halved the deficit and Woolfenden’s headed goal was disallowed.

Luis Diaz’s header handed the visitors the advantage 10 minutes before half-time, after Trent Alexander-Arnold had seen a potential early opener chalked off following a VAR review. Diaz then doubled his tally seven minutes later with a low finish into the bottom corner after being picked out by an intricate pass from Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian scored against United in the Premier League for the 12th time after the break, Liverpool punishing yet another mistake from the Red Devils' midfield to add some gloss to the scoreline. The triumph sees Liverpool join Manchester City as the only two sides with 100 per cent records after three matches, while United enter the international break in 14th with three points. How the match unfolded\\nHaving seen Diogo Jota flash an effort wide of Andre Onana’s goal early on, Liverpool thought they had silenced the Old Trafford faithful in the sixth minute. A sweeping move saw Alexander-Arnold convert at the back post despite the best efforts of Diogo Dalot on the line, with the goal awarded on-field but overturned after a VAR review as Salah was found to have been offside in the build-up. However, Slot’s side would get their noses in front in the 35th minute as a poor pass from Casemiro was intercepted, then Salah crossing for Diaz to nod home at the far post. The pair combined again to double the Reds’ advantage three minutes before the break, with Salah again the architect as his cute pass into the area was finished smartly by Diaz after Casemiro had been dispossessed. Salah got his name on the scoresheet after 56 minutes, finishing into the bottom-right corner after Kobbie Mainoo had been dispossessed in midfield, as things threatened to get ugly for United. United lose midfield battle\\nMuch of the talk throughout Erik ten Hag’s time in the United dugout has centred on the Red Devils' lack of tactical identity, and their much-maligned midfield was ruthlessly exposed again by Liverpool. However, those behind them were not on the same page as Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate were able to get Liverpool moving upfield with relative ease. But fellow midfield youngster Mainoo was then culpable when Salah scored his 10th goal in nine appearances at Old Trafford, seeing his pocket pinched by Alexis Mac Allister, who got the Reds motoring upfield again. Slot machine pays out jackpot\\nLiverpool’s trip to Old Trafford marked their sternest test under Slot to date, but the Dutchman passed it with flying colours. Perhaps unlike his United counterpart, Slot has already stamped a recognised style upon his group of players, with their expansive and dynamic football building on the foundations laid during Jurgen Klopp’s glittering nine-year stint at Anfield. An unusually quiet transfer window saw Liverpool miss out on a defensive midfielder who might have been the final piece of the puzzle, though Ryan Gravenberch’s recent showings have suggested he has the quality to fill that void for the rest of the season. Diaz and Salah were the notable standouts on Sunday, with the latter becoming only the second player (after Alan Shearer at Elland Road) to score 10 goals at an away ground in the Premier League. Liverpool’s recent domination of this age-old fixture looks set to continue under the guidance of their new head coach, and their early-season showings might cause concern elsewhere in Manchester, too.

Yet Wolves were handed a boost when Zabarnyi’s yellow card for a slide on Ait-Nouri was upgraded to a red. The visitors swiftly made their numerical advantage count – Cunha smashing beyond Kepa after the ball fell kindly for him in the area. Wolves took control after half-time, shuffling the ball past Bournemouth with relative ease. Cunha the hero – again\\nAfter nearly spurring Wolves on to fight back for a point in their last league match against Liverpool, Cunha was once again the bright spot for Pereira as the Brazilian continued his brilliant form, netting his 13th goal of the season. This could, though, prove to be his most important, as Wolves finally put some daylight between themselves and the bottom three. Cunha has been Wolves\\' talisman this season, and with goals in each of his last three matches, it was no surprise to see him be the key element again. A few minutes after Semedo and Bellegarde had tested Kepa early on, Cunha followed suit with a signature curling shot from distance. With an apparently kinder run of fixtures coming up, including a league encounter at Molineux against Fulham in midweek, Wolves have every reason to believe that a spot in the Premier League next season can be theirs. Bournemouth were faced another setback against Wolves though, with Zabarnyi’s red card leaving them down to 10 men just 31 minutes in. Club reports\\nBournemouth report | Wolves report\\nWhat the managers said\\nAndoni Iraola: \"It is very difficult with 10 men but we did a great effort. \"\\nKey facts\\nBournemouth have lost back-to-back Premier League home games for the first time since October 2023, a run which also included a defeat to Wolves. Meanwhile, the Cherries have lost consecutive league games without scoring at the Vitality Stadium for the first time since April 2023 under Gary O\\'Neil. Munetsi is the first Wolves player to be directly involved in a goal on his first Premier League start for the club since Craig Dawson against Liverpool in February 2023. Wolves are unbeaten in their five Premier League away games at Bournemouth (W3 D2), their most games against an opponent on the road without defeat in the competition. Cunha has scored 13 goals in 25 Premier League appearances for Wolves this season, with only Raul Jimenez netting more across a single campaign in the competition for the Wanderers (17 in 2019/20).'}\n",

However, Wolves went ahead in the 21st minute when the ball broke kindly on the edge of the area for Strand Larsen, whose shot took a slight deflection off former Wolves defender Maximilian Kilman before beating Areola. The Norwegian was slipped in by Joao Gomes, but Marshall Munetsi could only rattle the crossbar after running onto the loose ball. Although Munetsi missed another chance to put the game to bed in stoppage time, Wolves held out to move a step closer to securing their Premier League place. Strand Larsen doubles up in Cunha absence\\nWolves had pulled away from immediate danger after collecting 10 points from their last six Premier League matches. Nevertheless, they would have been wary, having lost on three of their five most recent outings at Molineux. Matheus Cunha watched on from the stands as he continued to serve his four-match suspension, but Strand Larsen stepped up in his absence with a fine strike taking his league tally for the season into double figures. Wolves are strong when they take the lead, avoiding defeat in each of their last seven matches when scoring first prior to this game, and they never looked in danger of seeing that streak end, with West Ham struggling to create many opportunities.

Toothless Hammers’ struggles on travels continue\\nWest Ham’s previous six away Premier League matches had yielded just one victory and three defeats. Ferguson arguably should have put them ahead when he was found by Jarrod Bowen in the six-yard box, but he could not make clean contact. The Hammers were always going to face an uphill battle from that point, having failed to win this season when conceding first. In an attempt to buck that trend, the West Ham head coach shuffled his pack by making three changes at the break – among them, the return of Fullkrug after three months out. However, it took over half an hour for the Hammers to threaten. West Ham are unlikely to be dragged back into the relegation battle with a 17-point cushion between them and Ipswich, but Potter will want his side to bounce back and finish the season as strongly as possible.

However, Arsenal struggled to carve out chances against a well-drilled West Ham defence at Emirates Stadium and were punished when Jarrod Bowen nodded Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross home just before half-time. Ben White went close to a last-gasp equaliser, but West Ham held on. How the match unfolded\\nWest Ham frustrated Arsenal throughout the first half, with Mikel Merino, starting up front, prodding wide when presented with the Gunners' best chance of the first 45 minutes. At the other end, Tomas Soucek twice headed over from near the penalty spot either side of Bowen sending a rushed effort trickling wide. Wan-Bissaka burst forward to cross for the unmarked Bowen to nod in. Bowen was inches away from turning Aaron Cresswell's cross home as West Ham continued to threaten after the break, before Leandro Trossard finally worked Alphonse Areola with a low drive. But Arsenal's hopes of a comeback suffered a massive blow when Lewis-Skelly lost possession to Mohammed Kudus and immediately chopped him down, with referee Craig Pawson upgrading the punishment from a yellow card to a red after a VAR review. After that half-chance, Merino was starved of service as West Ham set up a wall of black shirts on the edge of their area, with Arsenal's attempts to pick the lock growing increasingly desperate. When Bowen started the counter-attack that culminated in his 44th-minute goal, all 10 Arsenal outfielders were within 30 yards of Areola's goal, giving West Ham acres of space to exploit on the break. Potter works his magic\\nGraham Potter's first league game in charge of West Ham ended in a 3-2 victory over Fulham in mid-January, but a return of one point from their next four games had dampened any enthusiasm at the London Stadium. West Ham also switched to a 3-5-2 system, a change which proved inspired as the well-drilled visitors denied Arsenal any space in central areas. Arsenal left-back Riccardo Calafiori looked to provide the Gunners with an extra body in attack, but the space he left in behind was ruthlessly exploited by Wan-Bissaka, who motored down the right before supplying a pinpoint cross for Bowen to score. The fact that Arsenal needed 62 minutes to force a meaningful save from Areola was testament to West Ham's outstanding defensive organisation. Potter earned a reputation for preaching an attractive style of front-foot football while in charge of Brighton & Hove Albion, but this victory displayed his adaptability, as the Hammers dug in for their first clean sheet of 2025.\"}\n",

      "{\"Nott'm Forest\": \"Anthony Elanga struck the winning goal against his former club as Nottingham Forest beat Manchester United 1-0 at the City Ground. Fresh from booking their place in the FA Cup semi-finals with a penalty shoot-out victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday, Nuno Espirito Santo's men took another big step towards qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. It was a trademark counter-attacking goal that decided the contest, with Elanga running from deep inside his own half before tucking home after only five minutes. Man Utd remain in 13th spot, while the victory takes third-placed Forest eight points clear of Chelsea and nine above Manchester City ahead of their matches later this week. How the match unfolded\\nMatz Sels pushed a long-range effort from Bruno Fernandes wide early on, and Forest then hit the front with a devastating counter-attack from the resulting corner. After Fernandes's cross was cleared, Elanga carried the ball from deep inside his own half before stroking into the bottom-right corner from the edge of United's area. Two huge opportunities fell the way of the defender, who was unable to divert Patrick Dorgu's cross on target before forcing a heroic goal-line clearance from Murillo deep into stoppage time. No Wood, no problem\\nForest have repeatedly made a mockery of suggestions their form will dip, but there must have been concern when talisman Chris Wood suffered a hip injury on international duty with New Zealand. Although Taiwo Awoniyi came in to replace Forest's 18-goal marksman on Tuesday, it was those flanking the Nigerian – Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – that carried the greatest threat. Rapid counters have embodied Forest's identity this season, and Elanga carried the ball an astonishing 85 metres for his opener, travelling from midway inside his own half to the United box. This was not a vintage performance – after edging ahead, Forest did not attempt another shot until first-half stoppage time. But even the loss of Ola Aina to injury did not shake their defensive resolve, with Nuno Espirito Santo seamlessly switching from a 4-2-3-1 to a 3-4-3 formation. Forest got a slice of fortune when the woodwork thwarted Dalot, and they were indebted to Murillo for denying Maguire in the dying seconds, but for long periods, Man Utd were limited to hopeful long-range efforts. Only five points separate fourth-place Chelsea from AFC Bournemouth in 10th, but Forest have every chance of pulling away from that pack, with or without Wood. That change led to Fernandes adopting a deeper role, and his influence was reduced after the break even as Forest further conceded possession. His physicality caused some problems for Forest, but he was lacking the necessary composure when two big chances fell his way.

Arsenal\\'s win leaves them 12 points adrift of runaway leaders Liverpool, while Chelsea remain fourth – just one point clear of fifth-placed Manchester City and two ahead of Newcastle United, who have a game hand. How the match unfolded\\nAn unconvincing Chelsea defence was repeatedly exposed in the opening stages, with Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli going close before Declan Rice blazed over after Sanchez scrambled to parry Wesley Fofana\\'s deflected clearance.

Cucurella remained Chelsea\\'s unlikely attacking threat, though his weak header from substitute Tyrique George\\'s late cross proved little trouble for Raya as Arsenal held on for the win.

Palmer-less blues for Chelsea\\xa0\\nMaresca had already conceded before Sunday\\'s encounter that there was a \"quite big\" gap between Arsenal and Chelsea, and Palmer\\'s injury-enforced absence only made that difference in quality greater at Emirates Stadium. Although Palmer has struggled for form in recent weeks, this was the first time since April 2024 that Chelsea started a Premier League match without him – on that occasion, they lost 5-0 at Arsenal. Chelsea may have been fearing a repeat as Sanchez twice nearly afforded Arsenal an opener; first teeing up Martinelli with a poor pass before dropping Timber\\'s cross to almost set up Trossard. Pedro Neto, Christopher Nkunku and Jadon Sancho failed to make an impact, though full-back Cucurella almost profited from Raya\\'s questionable handling with Chelsea\\'s first shot on target. The same theme continued into the second half, with Neto drilling over an ambitious effort before Cucurella managed only Chelsea\\'s second attempt on target with his late downwards header straight at the untested Raya.

How the match unfolded\\nA bright City start faded when Rico Lewis was caught in possession by Curtis Jones, leading to Luis Diaz forcing a corner.

Szoboszlai looked to have turned provider for Jones to score Liverpool’s third in the 56th minute, but the Hungary international had just strayed offside, with the goal disallowed after a VAR review. Magnificent Salah leads Liverpool’s charge\\nSalah is still not sure of his Liverpool future, but as he heads into what might well be his final four months at the club, the 32-year-old is playing as well as he ever has. He was again integral to Liverpool’s attack. When City started brightly, it was Salah who offered the Reds’ first meaningful threat, getting away from Ake with a wicked turn of pace down the right flank. There may have been an element of good fortune about his opener, with Ake’s attempted block diverting the ball over Ederson’s dive, but Salah still had to make a sweet connection. Salah’s pace, strength and skill then caught out Gvardiol in the build-up to Liverpool’s second, which the Egyptian coolly set up with a perfectly weighted lay-off to Szoboszlai, returning the favour for his earlier assist. Not that Salah was Liverpool’s only star performer. Virgil van Dijk marshalled the defence; Jones was typically energetic in midfield and Szoboszlai matched Salah in regards to directly contributing to goals.

Ex-Chelsea defender Marc Guehi – remaining with the club despite being heavily linked with a move away from Selhurst Park – and company stood firm at the other end to keep the hosts at bay.

      "{'Bournemouth': \"Christopher Nkunku proved Chelsea’s hero as his late strike secured a narrow 1-0 win over AFC Bournemouth in the Premier League. The forward came off the bench to strike the winner five minutes from time at the Vitality Stadium, where Robert Sanchez kept out Evanilson’s first-half penalty. Bournemouth looked the more likely to take all three points in the contest, and Chelsea had Sanchez to thank for his penalty heroics, albeit after he had conceded the spot-kick for a foul on Evanilson. Marcus Tavernier and Ryan Christie also struck the woodwork for the hosts, but the Blues landed the decisive blow in the closing stages to snatch the victory. Nkunku’s late intervention moves Enzo Maresca’s side up to seventh place on seven points, two more than Bournemouth, who are in 11th. How the match unfolded\\nBournemouth carried the greater attacking threat early on and went close to breaking the deadlock after just four minutes when Tavernier's thunderous long-range strike rattled the crossbar. Bournemouth were handed a golden opportunity to take the lead in the 37th minute from the penalty spot when Sanchez tripped Evanilson, but the Chelsea goalkeeper redeemed himself by guessing correctly to deny the Brazilian. The Cherries went close again after the break with Sanchez keeping out Kluivert following a jinking run, before Evanilson's header was ruled out for offside. Bournemouth taste first defeat\\nIt looked a real possibility that Bournemouth would be able to remain unbeaten in their opening four matches of a top-flight season for the first time, only to be stunted by their lack of clinical edge in the final third. Fresh from their miraculous late turnaround against Everton before the international break, the Cherries looked to be building on that momentum, and they will count themselves unlucky not to have broken the deadlock when in the ascendancy. Indeed, they found Sanchez in fine form, with the Chelsea goalkeeper guessing correctly to thwart Evanilson from the spot, while Tavernier and Christie were only inches away from hitting the net when their impressive attempts rattled the woodwork. And Iraola’s side were made to regret not capitalising on those opportunities with Nkunku’s piece of individual brilliance condemning them to a first league defeat of the campaign. But the Cherries head coach will surely take confidence from their performance once again, though they face another tough test at Liverpool next weekend.

Following their emphatic 6-2 win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers, Chelsea have now secured a fourth successive away win, achieving the feat for the first time in two years. Chelsea were also part of creating a small slice of history on Saturday, as 14 yellow cards were shown in a fiery encounter – the most in a single Premier League match, and previously beating the record of 12 which were shown in Chelsea vs Tottenham Hotspur in May 2016 and Wolves v Newcastle United in August 2010.

      "{'Newcastle': '.', \"Nott'm Forest\": \"Alexander Isak scored twice as Newcastle United survived a late fightback to down fellow top-four hopefuls Nottingham Forest 4-3 in an enthralling Premier League contest. Lewis Miley restored parity before Jacob Murphy – who was at fault for Forest's opening goal – sent Eddie Howe's side ahead two minutes later. Nikola Milenkovic's cute finish and a late Ryan Yates strike had Newcastle reeling but they held on to move fifth, just three points adrift of Forest, who could drop to fourth if Manchester City beat leaders Liverpool later on Sunday. Murphy atoned for his earlier error by bundling over the line from point-blank range after Hall's attempted cutback pass was deflected by Murillo – and matters continued to go downhill for Forest. Aina's arm was deemed to be in an unnatural position to block another Hall cross after a VAR review and Isak just sneaked his unconvincing penalty past Sels, despite the Forest goalkeeper getting a hand to the spot-kick down the middle. Isak made it two goals in as many minutes when powering onto Joe Willock's pass, with his left-footed drive looping over the powerless Sels thanks to a Murillo deflection. Milenkovic pulled a goal back for Forest to make it 4-2, flicking Chris Wood's cross-shot past Nick Pope in the 63rd minute before Newcastle just about held on for victory after Yates turned home Morgan Gibbs-White's blocked volley in the 90th minute. The hosts could have levelled when Miley's volley was deflected wide by Murillo before Anthony Gordon narrowly missed Tino Livramento's fizzing cross. Hall continued to enjoy his freedom down the left and again punished Forest when the VAR recommended an on-field review for Aina's handball, with Isak fortuitously finishing after referee Jarred Gillett overturned his original call. Fabian Schar was denied by the crossbar after the interval, heading onto the woodwork from Hall's corner, though Howe will have just been relieved to survive waves of late Forest pressure for the victory. Comeback task too great after uncharacteristic Forest collapse\\nForest's brilliant start to this campaign leaves them controlling their top-four destiny, though following up the Fulham defeat with this loss to Newcastle will concern Nuno Espirito Santo. However, Aina was then repeatedly exposed on their right, with little cover offered by Anthony Elanga and Nicolas Dominguez, as all four Newcastle goals started from that flank. Elanga somehow smashed over after Neco Williams' headed back across goal in the second half, though Milenkovic's inventive finish placed Newcastle firmly on the ropes. An unmarked Murillo then headed narrowly wide and Gibbs-White's cross almost caught Pope out before Yates poached from close range after Schar's block to set up a grandstand finish. Forest wanted a last-gasp penalty after Gordon collided with Yates from behind, though referee Gillett waved away those protests as their first-half collapse ultimately proved too much to come back from. Regardless of their second-half improvements, Nuno will be desperate for a response in Wednesday's home match with Arsenal, who are six points clear of Forest.

The deficit awakened a previously struggling Watkins, who pulled one back before half-time by nodding home a Lucas Digne cross from close range. Watkins added to his tally after the break, tapping in after a mistake from Jack Harrison. Duran played super-sub yet again, entering the pitch on 69 minutes before firing Villa into the lead seven minutes later with a blistering strike from over 29 yards out. The victory lifts Villa into third place, only behind Liverpool on goal difference. It took a piece of individual brilliance in the 16th minute, as McNeil won possession from Amadou Onana in the Villa defensive line before firing into the far bottom right corner from the top of the box. Digne chipped a ball from the left byline to the far post where Watkins arrived first to nod it past Jordan Pickford. On 58 minutes, Villa had cancelled out Everton's lead as Youri Tielemans' long ball over the top was deflected into the path of Watkins by Everton’s Harrison, leaving the striker with little to do to tap home and double his tally. Duran delivered spectacularly to complete Villa’s comeback in the 76th minute as he rifled a blistering shot screamer into the roof of the net, leaving Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez shocked. Watkins back in the goals for Villa\\nPrior to Saturday, Watkins had not scored for Villa since 14 April, exactly five months ago to the day. Against Everton, however, he proved instrumental in the hosts’ comeback as he provided both goals that brought Unai Emery’s side level with Everton, before Duran finished the job. Watkins returned to Villa off the back of reaching the UEFA EURO 2024 final with England, having scored the decisive goal to put the Three Lions through in the semi-finals. It is a tough ask for any player to return to form after a shortened pre-season, but the expectations on Watkins are such that he is not afforded the luxury of being eased back into action with little scrutiny. Today, however, Villa Park witnessed his impressive finishing return and, with it, his confidence. While the visitors’ attacking instinct has visibly improved as they doubled their season’s goal tally inside the opening 30 minutes of their encounter at Villa Park, their defensive discipline remains lacking. The substitute was at fault for Watkins’ first goal, giving Digne far too much space, but Everton’s 13 goals conceded in four matches cannot be pinned on one substitution.

Sean Dyche will be left wondering if he is living in a recurring nightmare after his side once more find themselves leaving with zero points having had a two-goal lead. Dyche was forced into an early defensive change as Vitalii Mykolenko went down injured in the 26th minute, leading to the introduction of natural midfielder James Garner. The substitute was at fault for Watkins’ first goal, giving Digne far too much space, but Everton’s 13 goals conceded in four matches cannot be pinned on one substitution.

David Moyes was staring down the barrel of a defeat to his former club, but like he did against Brentford towards the end of February, O’Brien was on hand to earn a share of the spoils for the Toffees. Tomas Soucek, who netted in West Ham’s 3-1 win in the corresponding fixture last season, broke the deadlock with a fine finish in the 67th minute at Goodison Park. But Everton’s pressure told when O’Brien headed home from Idrissa Gueye’s volleyed centre in the 91st minute, and the hosts could then have won it with virtually the last kick of the game, only for Carlos Alcaraz to drag wide. The draw moves Everton above Manchester United – who play on Sunday – into 14th, two places above West Ham courtesy of a better goal difference. How the match unfolded\\nWest Ham might have taken an early lead when James Ward-Prowse’s whipped corner flicked off Jarrad Branthwaite, but Jordan Pickford pulled off a stunning one-handed save to spare his team-mate’s blushes. Jarrod Bowen forced Pickford into another good save in the 28th minute, though Everton thought they had a golden chance to go ahead when they were awarded a penalty on the stroke of half-time. But it was West Ham who struck first when Bowen danced between Everton’s defence and slipped it into Soucek, who duly curled a low effort into the right-hand corner. Moyes threw on Armando Broja and Youssef Chermiti as Everton searched for an equaliser, with the latter seeing a strike well saved by Alphonse Areola. Moyes’ men just don’t give up\\nMoyes’ side arrived at Goodison Park brimming with confidence, the Scot freshly crowned Barclays Manager of the Month for February. Everton’s manager, of course, knows West Ham better than most. But this was not a vintage performance from the Toffees. Playing out wide, Alcaraz found his influence limited, though, and it was telling that Everton improved once they had gone behind and Moyes moved the former Southampton playmaker central. And under Moyes, Everton just do not give in. Everton have matched their best unbeaten streak in the Premier League, which was previously set between December 2016 and February 2017, and are now 17 points above the relegation zone. Potter shuffled his starting line-up for the trip to Goodison Park, with Lucas Paqueta’s return from injury a boost, and West Ham will likely consider themselves unfortunate not to have gone into the break ahead, as they were frustrated by Pickford. There was nothing Everton’s goalkeeper could do to deny Soucek the opener, though – the Czech showing once again just how crucial he is to West Ham’s attack.

Though they conceded a fourth goal, Ipswich showed the grit and determination to bite back at Forest through Hirst, and those characteristics will need to be on show for their remaining nine matches if they are to stand any chance of not returning to the Championship.

Erling Haaland converted from the penalty spot and Omar Marmoush scored with a 20-yard drive either side of Pervis Estupinan\\'s wonderful free-kick. Brighton remain seventh in the table, one point behind Man City, who stay fifth. Man City swiftly hit the front at the other end when Adam Webster conceded a penalty with his scything challenge on Marmoush, and Haaland confidently found the bottom-right corner. Estupinan levelled in the 21st minute with a delightful free-kick that went in off the far post, but Marmoush re-established City\\'s advantage with an excellent strike from the edge of the box six minutes before half-time.

Only one of those – Ortega replacing Ederson in goal – was enforced as Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva and Matheus Nunes dropped to the bench. Marmoush, Ilkay Gundogan and Rico Lewis were recalled, and the former made a speedy impact to win City\\'s penalty. Having linked up well with Haaland, the Egyptian left Webster bamboozled with a clever turn and was chopped down. Haaland made no mistake, slotting home for his 84th goal in 94 Premier League appearances. Haaland benefited from having a foil in attack, with Marmoush almost playing as a second striker. But Marmoush is just as comfortable operating outside the area, as he showed when rifling a shot off the left-hand post and into the net to put City 2-1 up. Marmoush\\'s partnership with Haaland looks promising, and he also appears to have struck up a solid understanding with Gundogan, who assisted him here after also teeing the Egyptian for one of his three goals against Newcastle United last month. But while there were positive signs in attack, City struggled at the back.

The away side knew a victory over City would ensure they ended the weekend fifth in the table – a position that will likely be enough for Champions League qualification, given the strong performances of English clubs in Europe this season. They could have been discouraged after City\\'s second goal, which came from Georginio Rutter being dispossessed by Nico in a dangerous area, but they stuck to their task impressively.

Pep Guardiola\\'s hosts knew a victory would take them above fourth-placed Chelsea, while Brighton had the chance to leapfrog Man City, but both sides had to settle for a point. However, Abdukodir Khusanov\\'s own goal made it 2-2 early in the second half and Brighton missed a big chance to score a late winner. Brighton remain seventh in the table, one point behind Man City, who stay fifth. How the match unfolded\\nBrighton thought they had a sixth-minute opener when Kaoru Mitoma bundled the ball home, but referee Simon Hooper ruled he had nodded the ball out of Stefan Ortega\\'s hands. City survived a major scare when Joao Pedro rolled an effort narrowly wide just before the break, but Brighton levelled in the 49th minute when Jack Hinshelwood\\'s shot on the turn deflected in off Khusanov for an own goal. Both sides had chances at 2-2 as Yankuba Minteh somehow failed to turn Diego Gomez\\'s cross in for Brighton, while Nico Gonzalez\\'s downward header rattled a post at the other end. It was Brighton who missed the clearest opportunity, with Carlos Baleba letting City off the hook when he blasted over from a great position late on. Seagulls stick to their task\\nFabian Hurzeler\\'s Brighton travelled to the Etihad Stadium in excellent spirits, chasing a seventh successive victory in all competitions and a fifth in a row in the Premier League. It has been a real turnaround for the Seagulls, who went eight league games without a win either side of Christmas and were routed 7-0 by Forest as recently as last month. Brighton remain right in the mix to finish in one of those top places despite falling just short of victory. The visitors got a huge slice of fortune for their second equaliser, but that was the least they deserved from a positive second-half display, and some more composed finishing would have earned them three points, with Hurzeler visibly frustrated when Baleba could not convert late on after being set up by Joao Pedro. While Brighton were unable to earn a club-record fifth straight win in the top flight, they remain strong contenders for European qualification and have an FA Cup quarter-final against Forest to come after the international break, before a crunch league match with Aston Villa.

The pressure was on the Blues following three straight defeats in all competitions, but they had far too much quality for Ivan Juric's strugglers. The result sees Enzo Maresca’s team leapfrog Bournemouth, Newcastle United and Manchester City to go fourth, though the latter two sides are in action on Wednesday. How the match unfolded\\nThe first major chance fell Chelsea's way in the 23rd minute as Cole Palmer was slipped in behind by Enzo Fernandez, only to see his shot smothered by Aaron Ramsdale. But the Blues did break through from the resulting corner. Palmer skewed wide when presented with another good chance on the right side of the area, but Neto soon doubled Chelsea's lead with a powerful near-post finish after being fed by Nkunku. Chelsea went on the hunt for more goals in the second half, but Ramsdale got down well to repel Nkunku's header before teenage substitute Tyrique George fired over from a tight angle. Chelsea's supporting cast step up\\nChelsea approached Tuesday's game under mounting pressure, with tentative talk of a title bid prior to Christmas having been replaced by concern over their hopes of European qualification. The downturn in form experienced by Palmer has not helped matters, with the Blues talisman failing to provide a goal or an assist in six consecutive games across all competitions ahead of this one. Palmer’s struggles continued as he squandered two huge chances in the first half, losing a one-on-one duel with Ramsdale then appearing to be caught in two minds as he sent an awkward attempt rolling across goal and wide. But if any team should have the depth to cope when their star attacker is not at his best, it is Chelsea. Chelsea's poor run had coincided with a tricky set of fixtures, but with a home game against struggling Leicester City up next on March 9, they now have a chance to build some momentum. Southampton errors continue\\nLike Chelsea, Southampton entered this game having lost their last three, with Saturday's 4-0 defeat to Brighton prompting some stern words from head coach Juric. Southampton were still in the contest at that point, but yet another individual error granted Chelsea daylight, with Flynn Downes sending a sloppy pass straight to Cucurella in the build-up to Neto's goal. When Cucurella himself hit the target late on, he capped a move that started with Jack Stephens having a shot blocked on the edge of Chelsea's box, with Southampton's defenders nowhere to be seen as the Blues quickly worked a five-on-three break.

The Magpies skipper scored the only goal to settle a closely fought contest at the London Stadium ahead of their EFL Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday. Guimaraes latched onto Harvey Barnes’ 63rd-minute cross to volley past Alphonse Areola, who produced a magnificent save to thwart a spectacular Max Kilman own-goal moments earlier. How the match unfolded\\nWest Ham went straight on the attack with just 43 seconds on the clock when a cross to the far post reached Tomas Soucek, who fired over from inside the six-yard box. Newcastle went close at the other end as Barnes diverted Kieran Trippier’s drilled effort towards goal, only to be denied by Areola, with the West Ham goalkeeper also saving the winger’s header soon after. Areola came to the rescue again in the 61st minute, somehow managing to brilliantly claw the ball off the line after Kilman deflected Jacob Murphy's cross dangerously towards the hosts' net. However, Areola was powerless as Newcastle broke the deadlock two minutes later, with Guimaraes arriving late to volley home Barnes' centre from inside the six-yard box. West Ham attempted to push for the equaliser late on, but they never truly threatened the stubborn Newcastle defence, who held out for a first clean sheet in six matches across all competitions.

After recording back-to-back victories, the Hammers were looking to record three straight Premier League wins for the first time since December 2023 under David Moyes. However, as Newcastle grew into the contest, Areola had to be on top form to prevent the Magpies from striking first. Yet, West Ham did not learn their lesson, and further slack defending was eventually punished, with Guimaraes allowed to ghost into the box and steer home. The Hammers head to Goodison Park this weekend to face former boss Moyes and his resurgent Everton side. The winger brought the best out of Areola at his near post, before providing the telling cross for Guimaraes to volley in the winning goal.

Liverpool had earlier gone close through Luis Diaz as he struck the base of a post in the first half, but they struggled to pose Nuno Espirito Santo's men too many problems in a flat display. The defeat, which comes after impressive shutout victories over Ipswich Town, Brentford and Manchester United, means Liverpool have lost early ground on Manchester City, who now boast a three-point lead at the top of the Premier League table. Matz Sels proved his worth for the visitors in the first half, making saves at close range to deny Diogo Jota and Alexis Mac Allister, then being forced into action directly from a corner by Trent Alexander-Arnold in the 35th minute. Amid an uncharacteristically quiet display, Mohamed Salah came alive in the 51st minute, twisting and turning to fire a shot towards the near post, but once more, Sels proved equal to it.

It was Welbeck's 30th Premier League goal for Brighton, the joint-most for the Seagulls in the competition along with Pascal Gross. Brighton's rapid start had earlier been rewarded when Bournemouth goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga clumsily felled Joao Pedro, who opened the scoring with a 12th-minute penalty at the Amex Stadium. However, Justin Kluivert levelled with a stunning effort just past the hour before Brighton – despite being on the ropes – delivered their counter-attacking blow with 15 minutes remaining.

Mitoma then touched narrowly off target after Gomez's smart through-ball, and Brighton's new midfielder repeated the dose with another incisive pass in behind Dean Huijsen to tee up Joao Pedro to win the penalty. Vibrant winger Mitoma was again afforded too much room by makeshift full-back Lewis Cook, ghosting inside onto Lamptey's cross before striking Kepa's left-hand post with a well-timed volley. Hurzeler will still have decisions to ponder at the back, with Bournemouth regularly cutting through Brighton without reward, but their resilience in the face of relentless second-half pressure will please the German head coach.

Brighton's rapid start had earlier been rewarded when Bournemouth goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga clumsily felled Joao Pedro, who opened the scoring with a 12th-minute penalty at the Amex Stadium. Welbeck's vital impact from the bench saw Brighton move into eighth, level on points with seventh-placed Bournemouth, who are part of the chasing pack within touching distance of the top four. A moment of individual brilliance restored parity for Bournemouth as Milos Kerkez played a simple offload to Kluivert, who cut inside from the left and whipped it into the top-right corner from a tight angle at the edge of the box. Bournemouth almost struck a double blow soon after, but Verbruggen produced an expert stop from close range after Marcus Tavernier's effort had deflected into Dango Ouattara’s path. Vibrant winger Mitoma was again afforded too much room by makeshift full-back Lewis Cook, ghosting inside onto Lamptey's cross before striking Kepa's left-hand post with a well-timed volley. Hurzeler will still have decisions to ponder at the back, with Bournemouth regularly cutting through Brighton without reward, but their resilience in the face of relentless second-half pressure will please the German head coach. Iraola concern for blunt Bournemouth\\nBack-to-back defeats against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Brighton may concern Andoni Iraola, although the Cherries were reduced to 10 men early on against Vitor Pereira's side on Saturday. Bournemouth's defence sorely missed the suspended Illia Zabarnyi, with James Hill struggling to support Huijsen in a wave of early Brighton pressure that was rewarded by Joao Pedro's opener. Iraola's side still created plenty of chances at the other end – Ryan Christie forced an early save on the stretch by Verbruggen before Ouattara headed Semenyo's left-wing cross harmlessly over. Luis Sinisterra's low cross-shot was then palmed away by Verbruggen in the dying seconds, with Evanilson unable to pounce, leaving Bournemouth unable to find a way back.

In leading his side to victory over his former club for the second time this season, Enzo Maresca takes Chelsea back up to fourth, while Leicester remain six points below the dotted line in 19th. How the match unfolded\\nThe first half was a story of two near misses at each end, despite Chelsea's domination in the main. Jadon Sancho won a penalty in the 19th minute after Victor Kristiansen's foul, only for Palmer to see his firm effort from the spot excellently pushed away from the bottom corner by Hermansen. Leicester then went close at the other end, with Chelsea only able to watch as Tosin nodded onto his own crossbar after Robert Sanchez misjudged the flight of a cross. Leicester offered little in their attempts for an equaliser but needed Hermansen to keep the scoreline down with a late save to keep out Enzo Fernandez as Chelsea edged over the line. Cole needs a goal\\nChelsea got there in the end, but it is clear that Palmer is suffering his first true dip in form since signing for the club. Palmer made his presence known in his 72 minutes on the field; he had more shots than anyone, including an unfortunate one that was blocked by his own team-mate, while lining up efforts from distance in trademark fashion, but they were flying off target. He remained heavily involved in Chelsea’s attacking efforts, and the feeling is that if one goes in it will get things moving again. There is no doubt a run this long without a goal is uncharacteristic and could not have been predicted after Palmer netted 14 times in his first 23 appearances of the season. Palmer's own drought has coincided with Chelsea's dip in form and while they picked up three points on this occasion, they will be hoping he can rediscover his shooting boots as they continue their fight for a top-four finish, with Arsenal up next in the league. Foxes' fight falls short\\nLeicester had lost 12 of their 14 previous league matches and are entrenched in the bottom three, but there was no sign that they are resigned to their fate at Stamford Bridge. Hermansen, meanwhile, is a stand-out performer and looks to have a big future at this level, excellently standing up to the threat Chelsea did show, with a special moment from Cucurella needed to beat him.

Goals from Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister gave Liverpool their latest victory, while second-placed Arsenal fell further off the pace after a draw with Nottingham Forest. Overseen in the dugout by Johnny Heitinga, with head coach Arne Slot and assistant Sipke Hulshoff serving touchline bans, the league leaders took another significant step towards a much-anticipated title with only 10 matches to play. Liverpool did not have it all their own way, but Newcastle\\'s hopes of dealing a blow to their upcoming EFL Cup final opponents were hampered by the absence of top scorer Alexander Isak due to a groin issue. Eddie Howe\\'s side are left sixth, three points off the top four in a UEFA Champions League chase that now looks rather tighter than Liverpool\\'s title fight. How the match unfolded\\nLiverpool had seen an early penalty appeal waved away even before their first shot brought an 11th-minute breakthrough, with Szoboszlai\\'s low effort creeping past Nick Pope following Luis Diaz\\'s cutback. Szoboszlai and Mohamed Salah then each shot off target, but goalmouth action was scarce until Mac Allister doubled Liverpool\\'s lead in the 63rd minute. Salah shimmied in the box and created space for a square pass to the midfielder, who swept into the top-left corner. Salah\\'s superb pass might have seen Diaz add a third when he prodded wide at full stretch, then Liverpool\\'s star man drew a low stop from Pope, who was later adjudged to have been fouled when he spilled the ball in front of his goal line and Cody Gakpo poked in. It was comfortable by that stage for Liverpool, with Newcastle\\'s challenge fading fast as the away side worked instead to cap the scoring at two. Szoboszlai steps up for Slot\\'s side\\nThis win brought an end to a gruelling stretch of the season for Liverpool, who have played five league games in the space of two weeks. But rather than see their title tilt knocked off course by a testing schedule, the Reds have thrived. Salah had scored in each of the Reds’ prior four matches, yet he acknowledged to TNT Sports ahead of facing Newcastle: \"You\\'re not going to win the league alone, so you want other players to also perform. Now, with a week before their next game at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, he and Liverpool can regroup ahead of the run-in. Anfield agony again for Newcastle\\nIn a nine-game winning sequence in all competitions that transformed Newcastle\\'s season across December and January, they won at both Old Trafford and Emirates Stadium, arenas that had proved impenetrable for past Magpies teams. But Anfield, like the Etihad Stadium, continues to represent a step too far. Newcastle\\'s last win away at Liverpool came back in 1995. This was at least not the same meek surrender that had seen Newcastle blown apart by City in their previous away game, with the visitors going toe-to-toe with Liverpool for a time, but Howe\\'s call for his players to be brave ultimately proved their undoing. As Newcastle sought to attack in numbers, the gaps their full-backs left behind were exploited by Liverpool. Tino Livramento was out of position as Diaz advanced for the first goal, while Hall was still scrambling to recover as Salah laid on the second.

With Arne Slot watching from the stands as he serves his touchline ban, Southampton threatened an upset when Will Smallbone took advantage of a mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson to open the scoring just before half-time. But Liverpool were a team transformed after half-time. Darwin Nunez equalised in the 51st minute then won a penalty that was converted by Salah three minutes later. While Southampton stay bottom on nine points, Liverpool hold a huge advantage over second-placed Arsenal, who face Manchester United and Chelsea in their two games in hand in the next eight days. How the match unfolded\\nCurtis Jones slammed a powerful effort wide six minutes in, but chances were few and far between for Liverpool in a subdued start. Some excellent footwork from Ryan Gravenberch led to Trent Alexander-Arnold having a shot smothered by Aaron Ramsdale, while Nunez sent an acrobatic effort over. But that was the sum of Liverpool\\'s first-half efforts, and they fell behind in stoppage time as Smallbone took advantage of some hesitant defending to tuck home. Nunez got across his man to tap Luis Diaz\\'s low centre home, then was fouled in the area by Smallbone, allowing Salah to find the top-left corner from 12 yards. Alisson had to remain alert to deny Cameron Archer on the break, but the contest was over when Sugawara was penalised by the referee for a handball following a late VAR review, as Salah scored into the opposite corner. Liverpool overcome slow start\\nAmid the ecstasy that followed Liverpool\\'s smash-and-grab Champions League victory over Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, Slot sought to keep his players grounded. \"I have to convince my players that we will play three finals\", Slot said, putting this match on the same level as Tuesday\\'s return leg against Paris Saint-Germain and next week\\'s EFL Cup final against Newcastle United. But the leaders came out sluggishly and allowed Southampton to build confidence, and when Van Dijk dawdled on the ball in his own goalmouth, allowing Smallbone in to score, it did seem as though complacency may have played a part. Slot looked to change things with the half-time introductions of Andy Robertson, Alexis Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott, and it was something of a surprise to see Nunez stay on, after his kick at Walker-Peters was checked for a possible red card and cleared by the VAR. He tapped home after Diaz sped to the byline to cross, then got to a loose ball marginally ahead of Smallbone, who cut him down to grant Salah his first penalty of the game. Having added another from 12 yards late on, Salah now has a combined 44 goal involvements in the Premier League this season, making it his outright best campaign in the competition after he had 42 contributions in 2017/18. It may not have been a vintage Liverpool performance, but just as they did at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday, they got the job done, taking another big step towards the title. Smallbone – one of five players to keep his place in the lineup – was tenacious in midfield throughout the first half, and he showed great awareness to pick Van Dijk\\'s pocket and squeeze his shot home for the opener in stoppage time. But it was Smallbone\\'s challenge from behind on Nunez that led to Liverpool taking the lead, with that error coming at a vital time when Southampton needed to keep things tight.

      "{'Spurs': '.', 'Man City': \"Erling Haaland scored the only goal as Manchester City boosted their hopes of a top-four finish with a 1-0 away win over Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday. Sunday's loss to Liverpool left last season’s Premier League champions 20 points adrift of the leaders and Chelsea's 4-0 win over Southampton on Tuesday saw City drop out of the top four. But Pep Guardiola's side produced a dominant first-half performance in north London, which was rewarded when Haaland tapped home on his return from injury for his 20th Premier League goal of the season. Haaland saw a late second disallowed for handball following a VAR check that confirmed the referee’s on-field decision, while Pape Sarr missed a glaring chance to level when he headed over in the 98th minute. The hosts stay 13th in the table with 33 points, while City are now just one point behind third-placed Nottingham Forest, who they face in their next league match. How the match unfolded\\nHaaland had already forced one save from Guglielmo Vicario by the time he gave City a 12th-minute lead, sweeping Jeremy Doku's low cross home from six yards out. Doku should have had two further assists by the half-hour mark. First, his searching cross was somehow turned over by the unmarked Savinho, then he found Haaland in another brilliant position only for Vicario to make a vital close-range save. Mathys Tel and Brennan Johnson missed half-chances as Spurs finally put City under sustained pressure, then substitute Son Heung-min saw a scuffed effort repelled by Ederson. Haaland thought he had made the points safe in stoppage time, but the referee’s on-field decision to disallow the goal for handball was confirmed following a VAR review. Spurs almost made that reprieve count in the eighth additional minute, but Sarr headed over from the centre of the box as City clung on. Postecoglou's changes fall flat\\nSpurs have endured plenty of lows in 2024/25, but November's reverse fixture at the Etihad Stadium represented the high point of their campaign, and arguably of the entire Ange Postecoglou era. Despite being without first-choice centre-backs Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, Spurs tore City to shreds in a 4-0 win, with Dejan Kulusevski and Son contributing to a scintillating counter-attacking performance. City inch over the line\\nThis week, Guardiola refuted suggestions that re-establishing City's dominance will be the toughest task of his career, pointing out that the Citizens have already been through multiple rebuilds since he arrived in 2016. Many expect City to refresh their squad when the curtain comes down on their underwhelming campaign and, while this performance demonstrated there is work to be done, it also showed they have players capable of contributing in the future. Doku produced a lively display on the left-hand side and, with better finishing from his team-mates, he would have had three assists by the half-hour mark. Then there is Haaland. Guardiola was visibly concerned by City's lack of control after the break, but they rode their luck to get over the line.

      "{\"Nott'm Forest\": 'Arsenal lost more ground to leaders Liverpool in the Premier League title race after being held to a 0-0 draw by Nottingham Forest. In a contest between second and third at the City Ground, neither side were able to claim the win needed to boost their lofty ambitions this season. Riccardo Calafiori struck a post in the first half for Arsenal, who turned the screw after the break having struggled to break down Forest’s stern defensive rearguard. Forest are six points behind the Gunners, though now only one ahead of fourth-placed Manchester City. Arsenal had to wait until after half-time to test Matz Sels, with Merino’s header from a Declan Rice corner tipped up by the Forest goalkeeper, before Tierney also missed the mark from a set-piece. Forest were able to withstand the wave of Arsenal pressure and almost went ahead against the run of play in the 70th minute, but David Raya was equal to Chris Wood’s strike. Martin Odegaard’s blushes were then spared by the offside flag after the midfielder twice was denied from inside the box, first by Murillo’s sliding challenge and then the palms of Sels. Forest were still a threat, though, with Callum Hudson-Odoi flashing an effort over the crossbar late on before Thomas Partey dragged his strike from the edge of the box wide of the mark as the spoils were shared. Forest keep European ambitions on track\\nAfter back-to-back defeats in the Premier League, Forest knew a big performance was needed. Forest, as they often do, were happy to soak up the pressure before hitting Arsenal on the counter. That tactic almost succeeded when Morgan Gibbs-White sent Wood through on goal, but Forest’s top scorer was brilliantly halted by Gabriel. The hosts found themselves on the back foot in the second half, with Arsenal dominating the possession and creating the better chances, with Ryan Yates and Danilo introduced to try and inject some energy into the middle of the park. That double substitution allowed Forest to wrestle back an element of control, with Wood first denied by Raya before William Saliba’s excellently timed tackle thwarted the New Zealand international once again as he raced towards goal. Forest can use this point as momentum, with another huge encounter next up at the City Ground on 8 March when Man City roll into town. Calafiori endured an eventful start to the game, picking up a yellow card in the third minute for a tug on Hudson-Odoi’s shirt before being faced with the Forest winger again, who went down in the box under his challenge, which went unpunished by referee Andy Madley.

Raul Jimenez scored the opening goal after five minutes before Emile Smith Rowe doubled Fulham’s lead on 22 minutes. Fulham climb to eighth in the Premier League table, while Newcastle drop to sixth after their first defeat of the season. Fulham nearly gifted Newcastle an equaliser when Bernd Leno presented Fabian Schar with the ball from a goal-kick but the defender failed to punish the goalkeeper, shooting wide. Ruthless Cottagers show game management\\nMarco Silva did not want to see a repeat of last weekend when Danny Ings netted a 95th-minute equaliser to deny Fulham a deserved three points against West Ham. Fulham were again put in the same position against Newcastle, with a goal advantage heading into the final stages of the match but this time they showed the game management required to keep their opponents at bay, aided by a late Nelson strike. Silva also kept trust in Jimenez from the start to lead the line over Rodrigo Muniz and that decision paid off almost instantly when he produced a clever turn and precise finish to fire Fulham ahead. The Mexican looks like he has his confidence back after two goals in successive matches, which will delight Silva as he looks to propel the Cottagers up the table. Fulham have shown a lack of ruthlessness at times this season, but Smith Rowe managed to double their advantage in the first half to get that crucial second goal. The quality of the goal will please Silva after Smith Rowe finished a free-flowing move and played a neat one-two with Alex Iwobi. They then showed a different side to their game in the second half to keep Newcastle at bay to secure the victory and increase the positive mood currently around Craven Cottage. Fulham punished them just 44 seconds later when Jimenez scored the opening goal.

Villa move up three places to seventh, just two points behind fourth-placed Manchester City, while Brentford are 12th on 38 points as their winless home run was extended to seven matches.

Watkins turned provider to pull it back for Rogers, who fired it past Flekken, but the goal was ruled out by the referee following a VAR review as the former had strayed offside. Brentford pushed after that with Lewis-Potter coming closest, but his low strike from the edge of the box thumped the foot of the near post. Brentford’s home woes go on\\nBrentford had turned the Gtech into something of a fortress at the beginning of the season, winning seven of their first eight matches at home to start the campaign, but that is a long-distant memory now. Thomas Frank would have pinpointed this as a perfect chance to change their fortunes and continue their outside push for a European place, against a Villa side struggling on the road, but it was not to be. It took going behind for Brentford to come to life in the second half, with Lewis-Potter, in particular, proving a threat from the wing. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa eventually grew into the game, with the trio linking up into the build-up of Lewis-Potter hitting the woodwork. Robin Olsen denied Kevin Schade at his near post late on, and though they pushed until the final whistle, Brentford could find no way through. There were positives for Frank, though he may be glad to go on the road again, with a trip to Bournemouth up next.

United had staged a first-half comeback, with Sam Morsy’s own goal and Matthijs de Ligt’s close-range finish flipping the script after Jaden Philogene profited from an early defensive mix-up. Patrick Dorgu, who was partly at fault for Ipswich’s opener, was then shown a red card by the referee following a VAR review for a late challenge on Omari Hutchinson before Philogene’s second pulled Ipswich level. United moved up to 14th on 33 points, but Ipswich, who are yet to win a league game in 2025, remain third-bottom and five points behind Wolverhampton Wanderers. How the match unfolded\\nIpswich were gifted the opener after a terrible mix-up just four minutes in with Dorgu kicking the ball past Andre Onana, who had rushed off his line, leaving Philogene with the easiest of tap-ins at an empty net. United got a stroke of luck for the equaliser as Bruno Fernandes’ curling free-kick was headed into his own net by the unsuspecting Morsy. However, Dorgu was then sent off by the referee following a VAR review after catching Hutchinson with his studs, and Ipswich equalised on the stroke of half-time, Philogene curling in a cross that flew past the stranded Onana. Ipswich applied pressure, going close through Philogene, who tested Onana with a whipped shot from the edge of the box late on, but they could not find another equaliser. Audible groans were heard from the Old Trafford crowd after Philogene’s first goal, with a lack of communication leading to neither Dorgu nor Onana properly dealing with Morsy’s long ball over the top. United responded well to the early setback though, with Maguire’s fine thumping header kept out by Palmer before they eventually found parity through Morsy’s own goal – their first from open play in the first half of a Premier League game since early December. Chance goes begging for Ipswich\\nKieran McKenna said he was “relishing” his return to Old Trafford, where he worked as a coach under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and knew a win could give them a huge boost in the fight for Premier League survival.

Ollie Watkins restored parity before Ezri Konsa finished smartly to give Unai Emery’s side the lead in the 88th minute. In-form Jhon Duran put the result beyond all doubt in injury time as Villa climbed into third place on 12 points, while winless Wolves slumped to the foot of the table.

Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone did not have a single save to make in the opening 45 minutes but Villa began to make inroads after the break, with Yerson Mosquera – who later needed to be taken off on a stretcher due to a head injury – clearing off the line from Watkins. Villa’s striker was not to be denied a second time, though, as he received a neat pass from Morgan Rodgers before his finish deflected in off Craig Dawson.

Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone did not have a single save to make in the opening 45 minutes but Villa began to make inroads after the break, with Yerson Mosquera – who later needed to be taken off on a stretcher due to a head injury – clearing off the line from Watkins. Shaw was honoured before the match but Villa’s mid-week exploits were perhaps a major reason for a listless first-half display, in which they did not register a shot on target and ceded possession to Wolves consistently. They face Wycombe Wanderers in the EFL Cup in midweek, before taking on Ipswich Town on September 29. Wolves wait for elusive first win\\nO’Neil wanted his side to channel the frustration from their opening four games into a good performance at Villa Park, and he was rewarded this with an excellent first half from his side. Despite their poor form heading into the encounter, with just one win in their last 14 league games stretching back to last season, Wolves were well-organised from the moment the match began, not allowing any Villa players much space to manoeuvre in the centre and limiting the attacking runs made from the likes of Watkins and Rogers. But they struggled to contain the pair after the interval, and played most of the final 20 minutes in their own half, with the likes of Mario Lemina and Andre tiring in midfield, as their resistance was ultimately broken in the closing stages. Wolves, who will also have concerns over the extent of the damage suffered by Mosquera, will look for their first win of the season from their sixth attempt next week, as they host Liverpool next Saturday.

Jarrod Bowen played a huge part in West Ham’s second just before half-time, with his low finish deflecting in off Jannik Vestergaard for an own goal. West Ham leapfrog Everton into 15th, level on points with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United.

Aaron Cresswell’s dangerous cross was flicked into the path of Mohammed Kudus, whose close-range effort was parried by Mads Hermansen, but Soucek was on hand to tuck in the rebound. James Ward-Prowse’s corner dropped loose at the near post, and Bowen pounced to get a shot off, with Vestergaard only able to unwittingly turn it in.

Home fortunes change for the Hammers\\nWest Ham had lost their previous two Premier League home matches, beaten by Crystal Palace and Brentford.

But the Hammers’ home fortunes took a welcome turn as they comfortably saw off Leicester.

The Foxes have now shipped 32 goals across their 12 matches on the road – three months into Van Nistelrooy’s tenure, their defensive frailties are far from fixed, and may actually be getting worse. A series of errors cost Leicester heavily last week, a chaotic 15-minute spell in the first half paving the way for Brentford’s 4-0 rout at King Power Stadium. Leicester were simply too passive at the back again, their failure to clear inside the six-yard box twice leading to goals.

Jean-Philippe Mateta levelled with his 11th Premier League goal of the season early in the second half, but Flamengo loanee Alcaraz struck the winner with 10 minutes to play. They are level with 12th-placed Palace, whose goal difference is just one better.

Palace made to rue misses\\nPalace entered Saturday's game in fine form, having won four of their last six Premier League matches after starting the season with just three victories in 18 outings. The Eagles had scored two goals in each of those recent victories, but their clinical edge deserted them in the first half of this match, Mateta and Sarr both squandering clear-cut opportunities. Within 61 seconds of that latter miss, Palace were caught short at the back. Oliver Glasner's half-time introductions of fit-again duo Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze gave Palace more control, and the Eagles might feel a point was the least they deserved from this game. However, they failed to build on the momentum generated by Mateta's equaliser, and their defending for Alcaraz's winner was suspect. Glasner will view this result as a missed opportunity, with Palace having been on the front foot against tiring opponents at 1-1. Everton relied on a mixture of good fortune and strong goalkeeping from Pickford before ruthlessly punishing Palace's first mistake to open the scoring.

The Hammers remain in 16th place and 10 points above the relegation zone, while Thomas Frank’s side stay 11th but move to within three points of the top half. How the match unfolded\\nBrentford opened the scoring in the fourth minute when Mbeumo won an aerial battle with Emerson to release Schade. Although Alphonse Areola denied him twice – scrambling to claw off the line after the initial effort looped towards goal – the forward’s second attempt was over the line before it was pushed away. Mbeumo’s fierce low drive forced a smart reaction save from Areola in the 21st minute, while the offside flag denied Wissa soon after. Graham Potter shuffled his pack at half-time with a triple substitution and his players appeared rejuvenated at the restart, with Mohammad Kudus firing a decent opportunity over from Evan Ferguson’s cross. The Hammers continued to threaten, with the returning Lucas Paqueta firing narrowly wide and Ferguson seeing a low drive held, but the equaliser did not arrive and it spelt a third defeat in four games.

West Ham, who had failed to win any of their previous 13 Premier League games this season when conceding the opening goal, were unable to respond as Brentford continued to apply the pressure and look to extend their lead.

After demonstrating their attacking qualities in the opening 45 minutes, they had to show the other side of their game after the break as West Ham went in search of the equaliser.

Yoane Wissa might have done better when presented with a great opportunity in the 53rd minute, but after meeting Mikkel Damsgaard’s cross, the forward could not keep his effort down, with the ball clipping the crossbar on its way over. Spence came to Spurs’ rescue when he hooked away Carvalho’s overhead kick, and Postecoglou’s team made sure of the result as substitute Sarr latched onto Son’s through-ball before prodding through the legs of Brentford goalkeeper Hakon Valdimarsson to seal a much-needed win. No home comforts for the Bees\\nNo Premier League team have collected more points on home soil than Brentford this season, but Frank’s side seem to have hit a wall at the Gtech Community Stadium in recent weeks. Despite failing to win any of their last five home matcches in all competitions before this encounter, the Bees made a positive start, but without really threatening Spurs' goal. For all their positive attacking play this season, Brentford have been found wanting at the other end, and they conceded for a 14th straight home league match through Janelt’s own goal. It was only the third goal Brentford have conceded from set-pieces (excluding penalties) this season, but they responded well. However, the Wissa opportunity going begging proved crucial, as the Bees’ second-highest scorer this season was unable to apply the finishing touch to Damsgaard’s cross from right under the crossbar. However, Brentford must now look to put their troubles at home behind them by picking up form on the road – they face away matches against West Ham United and Leicester City next, with the Bees getting next weekend off due to being out of the FA Cup. Though they took the lead in fortuitous circumstances, Spurs would not have been complaining, and their dedication to the cause was epitomised by Richarlison taking Mbeumo’s powerful strike straight in the face before half-time. Spurs only registered two shots on target throughout the contest though, crucially, one of them resulted in the second goal that finally put the match beyond Brentford thanks to Sarr’s neat finish, while Postecoglou will no doubt be delighted with the work of Spence just before that, with the full-back alert when it mattered most in his own six-yard box.

      "{'Man Utd': '.', 'Crystal Palace': \"Jean-Philippe Mateta was the hero for Crystal Palace as his brace earned a 2-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Mateta then made sure of the points with one minute remaining, neatly slotting Daniel Munoz’s low cross past Andre Onana to finish off a blistering counter-attack. Kobbie Mainoo had struck a post early in the match for United, though the hosts looked unlikely to trouble Palace, who defended staunchly throughout. Palace leapfrog United in the table, moving up to 12th on 30 points, while Ruben Amorim’s side now sit one point and one place below them. Palace soon grew into the match though as Munoz thumped a header wide, while neither Ismaila Sarr nor Mateta could get a touch on Tyrick Mitchell’s cross. Mateta looked to have found the breakthrough shortly before half-time, bursting through 1v1, but Onana tipped his dinked effort wide of the far post. Palace substitute Eberechi Eze then had an almost instant impact as his free-kick was headed against the crossbar by Maxence Lacroix, with Mateta on hand to bundle in the rebound. United pushed bodies forward late on in search of an equaliser and were punished on the break, with Munoz putting it on a plate for Mateta to help it past Onana. However, for all their good play - Lisandro Martinez also saw a volley smothered by Palace’s stubborn defence - the Red Devils have now failed to score in the first half of a Premier League match for the 18th time this season. Eagles soar at Old Trafford\\nOliver Glasner’s side would have fancied their chances of bouncing back from their defeat to Brentford, having won three of their last five visits to Old Trafford. Palace remained happy to soak up the pressure in the second half, buoyed by their resolute first-half defensive showing. They bided their time until Eze, who was a doubt for this match due to injury, was able to come on shortly after the hour. Palace stepped up their attacking threat after his introduction. They did not panic despite Man Utd's late attempts to push them back, and thanks to Mateta’s goals, they are now unbeaten in six Premier League fixtures on the road, though it is back to Selhurst Park next to face a resurgent Everton.

Blues back to winning ways\\nEnzo Maresca said it was no coincidence that Chelsea’s form had dipped during the transfer window due to uncertainty, and with its imminent closure, the Blues appeared to get back on track. But Maresca was again left to rue individual mistakes in the first half, even if Chelsea responded well to going behind. Those substitutions also appeared to free up Palmer in a more fluid style. While Maresca still has issues to address, Chelsea have won two of their last three league matches ahead of their FA Cup and Premier League double-header away to Brighton & Hove Albion. An unhappy return\\nStamford Bridge has not been a happy hunting ground for former Chelsea managers in the past, and Potter was the latest to endure a frustrating return to west London. They had to bide their time in the first half as Chelsea kept the ball in the opening stages but eventually, chances came – Bowen and Kudus were both denied by Jorgensen while Andy Irving volleyed just over the bar.

      "{'Arsenal': '.', 'Man City': \"Arsenal moved back to within six points of the Premier League summit with a 5-1 rout of Manchester City, helped by Myles Lewis-Skelly's first senior goal. Arsenal first went ahead with just 103 seconds played, Martin Odegaard sweeping into an open net after a mix-up involving John Stones and Manuel Akanji. Erling Haaland equalised early in the second half with a fine header, but Arsenal retook the lead one minute later through Thomas Partey's deflected strike. Arsenal are now nine points clear of fourth-placed City, who could be overtaken by Chelsea should they beat West Ham United on Monday. How the match unfoled\\nLess than two minutes in, Akanji was put in trouble by Stones' pass and lost possession on the edge of Man City's area, allowing Havertz to square for a simple Odegaard finish. Haaland dragged City level 10 minutes into the second half, nodding Savinho's cross beyond Raya, but parity lasted just 105 seconds as Partey’s long-range effort deflected in off Stones. Arsenal get their revenge\\nThere is no love lost between Arsenal and Man City, who have forged one of the great modern-day Premier League rivalries over the last two seasons, with Pep Guardiola's men edging the Gunners in two close-run title races. Their matches tend to be fractious, and September's 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium was no exception. After Stones scored a 98th-minute equaliser to break Arsenal hearts, Haaland threw the ball against Gabriel Magalhaes' head, sparking a tussle involving several players. Haaland also clashed with several members of the Gunners' camp after full-time and it seems Gabriel had not forgotten those scenes. When Odegaard made it 1-0, Gabriel reacted by celebrating in front of Haaland. To rub salt into Haaland’s wounds, Lewis-Skelly celebrated by mimicking his iconic meditation celebration. They will have one eye on Liverpool's match in hand at Everton on 12 February, before returning to league action at Leicester City three days later. City errors punished again\\nLast time out in the Premier League, Man City were forced to come from behind to beat Chelsea after a mistake from debutant Abdukodir Khusanov gifted the Blues an early opener. Khusanov dropped to the bench on Sunday, with Stones brought in for his first league start since before Christmas. If Guardiola thought the return of his most experienced centre-back would bring an error-free performance, he was mistaken. Stones' pass to Akanji across the edge of the box was ill-advised, and the Switzerland international – taking his very first touch of the match – was blindsided by Leandro Trossard, who combined with Declan Rice to turn possession over. And while there was a huge hint of fortune about Arsenal's second goal, it came from another loose Man City pass in a dangerous position, this time from Phil Foden. Man City have now committed eight errors leading to goals in the Premier League this season, their most in any campaign under Guardiola.

      "{'Man City': 'John Stones scored a last-gasp equaliser as Premier League title rivals Manchester City and 10-man Arsenal drew 2-2 in a thrilling, fiery encounter at the Etihad Stadium. The Gunners looked all set to claim a statement win on Sunday, until City substitute Stones finished from point-blank range deep into second-half stoppage time. Erling Haaland’s 100th City goal handed the hosts a deserved advantage early on, only for Riccardo Calafiori and Gabriel Magalhaes to give the Gunners a half-time lead. For the majority of the second half, it looked as though City would not be able to make their numerical advantage count, with David Raya on top form in Arsenal’s goal. Yet Raya was finally beaten when Stones latched onto a rebound six yards out, with City claiming a potentially vital point that sent them back to the top pf the table, while Arsenal are fourth. How the match unfolded\\nHaaland needed just nine minutes to net his landmark strike on his 105th City appearance, bursting through the Gunners defence and prodding brilliantly beyond Raya after Savinho’s neat turn and pass. A serious-looking injury for Rodri gave City cause for concern, though, and Arsenal were level less than a minute later when Calafiori curled in a sensational left-footed effort. But Man City could find no way through, with Haaland and Josko Gvardiol coming closest to beating Raya. That was until the 98th minute, when City’s pressure finally told – Mateo Kovacic’s strike deflecting into the path of Stones, who sent the home crowd into raptures. City overcome Rodri blow… just about\\nMuch has been made for City’s ability to operate without Rodri within their ranks, having lost four of the nine matches in all competitions without their star midfielder last season, while only being defeated once in the 50 matches he featured in. After being welcomed into the heavyweight clash with a body blow from Kai Havertz in the opening seconds, Rodri – making his first league start of the season – was forced to withdraw after a tangle in the box with Thomas Partey that saw the Spaniard worryingly clutch his right knee. City’s frustration was further compounded when Calafiori’s long-range stunner levelled the scores, though they were complaints from the hosts, most notably from Walker, with Arsenal having taken a free-kick quickly, and Walker claimed he was out of position after he was called over to speak to referee Michael Oliver. While Trossard’s red card offered the hosts a way back into the match, City’s slick attacking football was met with Arsenal’s stern defensive rearguard, only for the kind of goal to not usually be associated with a Guardiola team to prove decisive. Stones’ leveller was anything but pretty, but it could prove pivotal even at this early stage of the campaign. So close, but so far for Arsenal\\nHaving shown glimpses of their attacking talents in the first half, it was Arsenal’s defensive resolve that shone through in a second, and it almost saw them withstand an endless wave of City pressure. The Gunners were camped in their own half after the break – and mostly in their own box – but their solid backline, which conceded the fewest goals in the division last season, restricted City to efforts from distance for the majority. After his penalty heroics in the Champions League against Atalanta in midweek, Raya again proved his weight in gold for Mikel Arteta, producing a number of fine saves, denying Walker, Haaland and Gvardiol, while Bernardo Silva hammered over from a rebound.', 'Arsenal': '.'}\n",

Nuno Espirito Santo\\'s team showed no signs of being rocked by their 5-0 defeat at AFC Bournemouth last weekend, going two better against Fabian Hurzeler\\'s error-prone side. A Lewis Dunk own goal set Forest on their way, then Anthony Elanga helped himself to three assists as Brighton\\'s backline was overwhelmed, teeing up Morgan Gibbs-White for one goal and two for Wood. Forest\\'s biggest ever Premier League victory takes them level on 47 points with second-placed Arsenal, who face Manchester City on Sunday. How the match unfolded\\nForest went ahead from their first attack 12 minutes in. Gibbs-White crossed from the right, and Dunk’s outstretched boot diverted the ball into his own net. Their second goal arrived after 25 minutes as Gibbs-White nodded Elanga\\'s corner home at the near post. Williams then struck the base of a post from 20 yards out, and the rampant hosts had a third when Wood nodded an Elanga cross home, with the goal given on-pitch and confirmed by VAR following a check for offside. How close Welbeck was to scoring\\nBrighton pushed in the early stages of the second half, but Wood killed any slim hopes of a fightback with a 64th-minute tap-in, and he then kept his cool from 12 yards to make it 5-0 after Tariq Lamptey fouled Gibbs-White. Forest were not done there, though, as Williams blasted in a sixth from close range before Silva drilled home a seventh, having intercepted a dismal pass from Bart Verbruggen. Magnificent seven for Forest\\nWith Forest suffering a chastening defeat against fellow surprise package Bournemouth last time out, some were left wondering if their momentum might have been stunted. Nuno demanded a reaction at home to another side harbouring European aspirations, and his team certainly did not let him down, with Gibbs-White, Elanga and Wood taking centre-stage. Forest\\'s last meeting with Brighton, a 2-2 draw at the Amex Stadium last September, was not one to remember for Gibbs-White, who was sent off for a scything challenge on Joao Pedro. But he was everywhere in the first half of Saturday\\'s game, forcing Dunk\\'s own goal with a threatening cross into the six-yard box then showing great desire to power Elanga\\'s corner home. Elanga has also enjoyed an excellent season, and three pinpoint crosses earned the former Manchester United winger three assists, taking him to eight for the season. He now has 17 Premier League goals this season, with only Stan Collymore in 1994/95 (22) netting more for Forest in a single campaign. Even after Nuno took the opportunity to give Wood and Gibbs-White a rest, Forest continued to hunt further goals and saw Williams and Silva chip in late on. It all amounted to a superb response from Forest, who have won eight of their last 10 league games. Brighton did carve out chances at the City Ground, and it could be argued that a 3-0 half-time lead flattered Forest somewhat. Perhaps most costly was a squandered opportunity from Yankuba Minteh, who broke through on goal but shot straight at Sels just two minutes after Forest\\'s second of the game. Forest\\'s seventh goal summed up their display, as Verbruggen passed straight to a grateful Silva on the edge of the box and was given no chance by the substitute\\'s finish.

However, it just proved too little too late for the Eagles, who suffered their first defeat in seven home league meetings with Brentford, and now Glasner will seek a response from his players when he takes them to Old Trafford to face Manchester United next Sunday. Bees win back-to-back on the road\\nLooking to close the gap on the top half of the table, Brentford will not have been overly confident ahead of facing in-form Palace. And after maintaining their defensive discipline for so long, they edged their noses in front via Mbeumo’s penalty – albeit in somewhat fortuitous circumstances. Although, after Schade doubled the lead, Esse ensured they would be in for a nervy finish, especially considering Brentford had conceded six Premier League goals in the 90th minute or later this season. Nevertheless, Frank’s side held out to make it back-to-back away league wins for the first time in nearly 18 months. The Bees can look forward to two more Premier League London derbies against struggling Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United – both of which they will enter with their tails up.

      "{'Wolves': \"Liverpool moved to the top of the Premier League table as Mohamed Salah's penalty handed them a 2-1 victory over Wolves at Molineux. Manchester City's 1-1 draw at Newcastle United earlier on Saturday handed Arne Slot's Reds the chance to go top, and Salah hit the winner from the spot after Nelson Semedo fouled former Wolves forward Diogo Jota. Ibrahima Konate had nodded Liverpool into the lead before his mistake at the other end allowed Rayan Ait-Nouri to briefly draw Wolves level early in the second half. Wolves never looked likely to equalise for a second time as their wait for a first win of the season continued, with Liverpool going close to a third goal on a couple of occasions. While the result took Liverpool one point clear of City and Arsenal at the summit, Wolves remain rooted to the bottom, with only one point from six matches. How the match unfolded\\nDespite injuries and illness leaving them short, Wolves kept Liverpool at bay for the majority of the first half, with Dominik Szoboszlai’s 40th-minute close-range shot straight at Sam Johnstone the best chance the visitors generated. Wolves' resolve was broken in first-half stoppage time, though – Johnstone failing to keep out Konate's header after Jota crossed from the left. Salah was gifted a chance for 2-0 after the restart, but he let Wolves off the hook by prodding wide after intercepting Mario Lemina's pass. A lapse at the other end got Wolves level as Konate went from Liverpool hero to villain. Curtis Jones tested Johnstone at his near post as Wolves wilted after the second Liverpool goal, the visitors cruising to back-to-back wins and top spot. Salah, Jota and Luis Diaz were kept quiet for much of the contest, with many of Liverpool's best opportunities the result of Wolves' insistence on playing out from the back in the face of a fierce press. Short-handed Wolves pay the price\\nIt has been far from an ideal start to the season for Gary O'Neil's Wolves, who had already faced Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa in a daunting run of opening fixtures. Wolves had shown plenty of positive attacking signs in those games, but a failure to remain solid at the other end has repeatedly proven costly, with six points dropped from winning positions in back-to-back losses to Newcastle and Villa. Things got tougher for O'Neil this week, with Yerson Mosquera suffering a serious knee injury that will likely end his season, and fellow centre-back Craig Dawson sidelined by illness. There was plenty to like about Wolves' performance on Saturday, with the trio of Lemina, Joao Gomes and Andre particularly impressive as they disrupted Liverpool's midfield, but two defensive lapses made the difference. Johnstone should arguably have done better when attempting to keep out Konate's first-half header, then Semedo was caught on his heels just moments after Wolves' equaliser, recklessly dragging Jota to the ground at the back post. The fixture list has not been kind to Wolves to start the season, but they must cut out the errors after shipping 16 goals in six league games.

Salah now has eight goal involvements in six Premier League games this term, a tally only bettered by Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer, and if this is going to be his final season at Liverpool, he is doing all he can to ensure the Reds look well placed to challenge on multiple fronts.

A match lacking in quality chances was settled by a huge slice of fortune when Martinez\\'s strike from 30 yards deflected off Sasa Lukic and looped over Bernd Leno in the Fulham goal. Fulham, in fairness, had created little themselves until Joachim Andersen\\'s thumping header was stunningly cleared off the line by substitute Toby Collyer in the closing stages. Victory lifts United up to 12th, while Fulham\\'s hopes of muscling their way into the conversation for European football took a blow, and they remain 10th. How the match unfolded\\nUnited mustered just one shot in a first half that Fulham edged. Alex Iwobi was the liveliest player and twice stung the palms of Andre Onana, while Raul Jimenez tried his luck with a couple of efforts that cleared the crossbar. But it was the visitors who struck the telling blow when Martinez tried his luck from range and saw his attempt cruelly loop over Leno. Fulham thought they had an equaliser when Andersen\\'s header looked destined to find the back of the net, only for Collyer to make a sublime clearance off the line. Iwobi a rare bright spark as Fulham falter\\nThere was very little to get the home faithful off their feet in a first half badly lacking in quality and composure. One notable exception was Iwobi, who already has his highest goals tally ever for a single Premier League campaign, with seven. Iwobi was a little more quiet in the second half and, frustratingly for Marco Silva, his side did not really create anything until after United took the lead, with Andersen\\'s header preceding Rodrigo Muniz firing over inside the penalty area. The Cottagers return to league action next weekend against in-form Newcastle United needing a positive result to get their quest for European football next season back on track. Huge slice of luck wins it for visitors\\nThere were cries of \"attack, attack, attack\" from the away end at Craven Cottage – where United remain unbeaten in nine Premier League visits – during a first half that produced little for the highlight reels. Some credit for that, of course, must be given to Fulham, who were typically well drilled and organised – hallmarks of Silva\\'s Craven Cottage tenure.

There was very little to choose between two sides separated by a mere point at kick-off, but Raul Jimenez’s second-half penalty, awarded for Murillo's foul on Andreas Pereira, proved decisive. Forest had started brightly as Taiwo Awoniyi missed an early chance, while Chris Wood saw a potential opener disallowed for offside in the 25th minute, with a VAR review confirming the on-field decision of referee Joshua Smith. However, Nuno Espirito Santo's team failed to find a spark without the suspended Morgan Gibbs-White as Fulham's own impressive start to 2024/25 continued. The result leaves Forest ninth in the table with nine points, with Fulham leapfrogging their hosts to move into sixth on 11 points. How the match unfolded\\nIt was Forest who had the first chance after a quiet opening as Awoniyi – making his first start of the campaign – shot wide after a long throw caused chaos in the Fulham box. Almost immediately after the restart, another VAR check resulted in Murillo being penalised for stepping on Pereira's foot. With Forest chasing the match, Nuno brought on Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi and the latter went close to finding the top-right corner after a slaloming run into the box. Nuno's changes fall flat\\nWith Gibbs-White suspended following his red card at Brighton last week, Forest boss Nuno was forced into attacking alterations. He decided to go with the added physical presence of Awoniyi, who partnered top scorer Wood in a two-pronged attack designed to unsettle the Fulham defence. Unfortunately for Forest, however, it seemed Awoniyi's inclusion prevented Wood from playing his natural game, reflected in the fact that he only touched the ball five times in the entirety of the first half. Awoniyi was replaced by Elanga immediately after the break as the hosts looked to inject more dynamism, but it was Fulham who made the breakthrough before producing a resolute defensive performance. Despite a positive start to the new campaign, Forest have now gone six matches without a victory on home soil, and things do not get much easier for them next time out, as they face in-form Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

However, two goals in the first five minutes of the second half turned Sunday's match on its head, with Jamie Vardy levelling just 57 seconds after the restart. Bilal El Khannouss then put Leicester ahead with a curler from just outside the penalty area, and the Foxes clung on to leapfrog Wolverhampton Wanderers and go 17th in the table. Leicester are one point clear of the bottom three and seven behind 15th-placed Spurs. How the match unfolded\\nJakub Stolarczyk was again busy in the Leicester goal early on, parrying Pedro Porro's strike then making a wonderful save to prevent Son Heung-min from finding the bottom corner. However, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was stunned into silence by two quickfire goals to start the second half - Vardy first equalised with a tap-in after goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky failed to gather Bobby De Cordova-Reid's cross. El Khannouss put Leicester ahead with a pinpoint finish into the bottom-right corner, after De Cordova-Reid pounced on some sloppy play from Rodrigo Bentancur. Porro saw a free-kick rattle the crossbar after a wicked deflection off Vardy, but that was as close as Spurs came before the final whistle. Porro was the only member of Spurs' first-choice back four to start, but both Leicester goals came from his flank. He was nowhere to be seen as De Cordova-Reid crossed for Vardy's leveller, then his ill-advised pass saw Bentancur lose possession for the second. Leicester avoid unwanted history\\nSpurs were not the only side desperately needing a result on Sunday, with things looking bleak for Leicester following a 2-0 loss at home to Fulham last time out. Supporters at King Power Stadium voiced their frustrations at the end of that defeat, with the Foxes threatening to equal their worst-ever losing run in the league - a streak of eight defeats between March and April 2001. The former Fulham man unsettled Spurs' backline by leading the Leicester press, also showing composure in the final third to record two assists. El Khannouss, meanwhile, gave another glimpse of his Premier League qualities by bending a wonderful finish just inside the post from 20 yards out, scoring his first goal since Leicester's most recent win, a 3-1 triumph over West Ham United on 3 December - Van Nistelrooy's first match in charge.

But Villa appeared to run out of steam and were put on the back foot by the Hammers in the second half, with Danny Ings and Lucas Paqueta both going close to a winner. The draw sees West Ham move 11 points clear of the bottom three, while Villa remain eighth, four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City. How the match unfolded\\nUnai Emery's hosts swarmed all over West Ham in the early stages, taking the lead after just eight minutes. A superb one-two between Ramsey and Ollie Watkins saw the former run through on goal and finish neatly with his left foot for his first Premier League strike since September 2023. Morgan Rogers also had the ball in the net two minutes later, but Watkins was flagged offside in the build-up. Ramsey back in business\\nIt has been so long since Ramsey broke into Villa's first team that it is easily forgotten he is still 23 years old and very much the club's future, as well as its present. He sent out a reminder of his exciting talent by opening the scoring early on at Villa Park, brilliantly latching on to Watkins' return pass before powering into the box to score. While Emery will be delighted that Ramsey is fit and firing, there will be real concern about Mings. Mings attempted to play on before hanging his head as he hobbled off the field and his side flagged without him, Lucas Digne coming on to fill in at centre-back after Emery was forced into a reshuffle. Still, while Potter will be encouraged by this display, reported interest in Villa substitute Jhon Duran makes sense.

The Cherries, however, were not to be denied a third goal, with Ouattara notching his second of the game following a dazzling run that ended with an assured finish.

Yet individual brilliance from McNeil gave the Toffees a taste of that comeback delight in an impressive second-half display from the hosts. Their first half was lacklustre, as Everton only created limited chances – Calvert-Lewin squandered their best opportunity, failing to make contact with McNeil’s cross in front of goal. After the restart, McNeil took matters into his own hands and dazzled with his stunning long-range effort off the right which Dean Henderson had no chance of getting to. Harrison’s ball from the right was perfectly weighted, and McNeil showed impressive control to set the ball up with his first touch before firing home with his second. It was a much-needed three points for a struggling Everton side who showed good resilience to hold onto a lead for the first time this season, and Dyche will be hoping they can truly kickstart their season from here.

So it was unsurprising that Everton’s breakthrough came from range as McNeil was left with too much space in the midfield after a sloppy giveaway, and they continued to struggle with McNeil’s clinical edge.

On the backfoot for large periods of the second half, the Toffees were forced to dig really deep. Everton will be confident of building on their recent momentum when they welcome struggling Leicester City to Goodison Park next weekend.

      "{'Liverpool': \"Cody Gakpo scored twice and set up another as Liverpool cruised to a 4-1 win over Ipswich Town at Anfield that maintained their six-point advantage at the Premier League summit. It was a dominant first-half showing from the hosts as goals from Dominik Szoboszlai, Mohamed Salah and Gakpo had them three ahead at the interval. After what had been a one-sided opening 45 minutes, the match became more even as it progressed, but any doubt over the outcome was ended midway through the second half when Gakpo headed in his second from Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross. Jacob Greaves struck with an aerial effort of his own in the last minute to give Ipswich a consolation, but it was otherwise a comfortable afternoon for Liverpool. Liverpool’s title rivals Arsenal were pushed to the limit as they won 1-0 despite being reduced to 10 men at Wolverhampton Wanderers, so the Reds’ lead at the top remains six points with a game in hand on the Gunners. How the match unfolded\\nDespite some early positivity from Ipswich, Liverpool quickly took control as their attacking power ruthlessly punctured the visitors three times before half-time. Szoboszlai got the ball rolling for Arne Slot's side as he arrowed past Christian Walton from the edge of the box in the 11th minute, before Salah reached 19 league goals for the campaign when he smartly crashed Gakpo's 35th-minute cross into the roof of the net.

Ipswich began to tire as the match progressed, and Gakpo's second goal of the match\\xa0 arrived via an inch-perfect ball from Alexander-Arnold on 66 minutes, adding extra gloss to the scoreline. Szoboszlai adds new dimension to Liverpool's attack\\nLiverpool are not short on goal threats in this campaign, with Salah already beating his league tally from last season while Gakpo and Luis Diaz are firmly on course to better their own league totals from 2023/24. However, the one area Liverpool have lacked goals from has been midfield, with Slot opting for greater control over dynamism from deeper areas. Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister have excelled as a deep double act in Slot's debut campaign, but the former is yet to score a league goal, and the latter has only managed one. Slot will not drastically change the direction of his midfield, but the addition of goals via late runs into the box will cause more headaches for opposition defences, as Szoboszlai looks to edge ahead of Curtis Jones as a consistent starter. Liverpool have a stacked fixture schedule coming up, including a hugely testing league trip to AFC Bournemouth next weekend, the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur on 6 February and the rearranged Merseyside derby on 12 February. In stark contrast to Liverpool's ability to spread goals around their team, Ipswich's chances of remaining in the Premier League next season rest heavily on Liam Delap's shoulders.

The Englishman has led the line superbly for Ipswich so far this season, with eight league goals scored as the powerful focal point of McKenna's attack. However, he is now on a run of just two goals scored in his last 11 appearances, and he clearly needs more support from those around him, having failed to record a shot in this game and with Ipswich having taken just one point from four matches since beating Chelsea at Portman Road in their last match of 2024.

      "{'Southampton': \"Newcastle United moved back into the Premier League's top four after in-form Alexander Isak made history with two goals in a 3-1 win at struggling Southampton. Isak became the first Newcastle player to score in five consecutive Premier League away games after cancelling out Jan Bednarek's 10th-minute opener with a first-half penalty. Southampton remain bottom of the table, 10 points adrift of Wolverhampton Wanderers in 17th, while Newcastle are a point clear of fifth-place Chelsea, who visit Manchester City later on Saturday. The hosts opened the scoring against the run of play when an unmarked Bednarek headed James Bree's right-wing cross into the top-right corner. Newcastle hit back 16 minutes later though when Isak swept into the bottom-left corner from the spot after being fouled by Joe Aribo. Martin Dubravka had to be alert to turn away Taylor Harwood-Bellis' acrobatic effort early into the second half, and that save proved pivotal minutes later when Anthony Gordon sent Tonali clean through to slide it into the back of the net. Murphy was then denied by the post before Fernandes burst in behind onto McCarthy's long ball and rifled past Dubravka, though a VAR review adjudged Fabian Schar had not touched the ball and found the Southampton midfielder offside. Southampton survived an early wave of pressure before capitalising at the other end through Bednarek's well-placed header, their first goal at home in four league games. Southampton's backline was nowhere to be seen yet again when Isak chested down for Gordon, whose first-time pass sent Tonali racing through before sending McCarthy the wrong way with a disguised finish. Captain Bednarek showed his defensive colleagues how to do it for one moment in the second half, clearing off the line when Joelinton seemed destined to drive into the bottom corner – but the damage was already done by that point. Juric desperately needs improvements at both ends of the pitch if Southampton are to mount an unlikely climb up the table, starting with a huge clash away at Ipswich Town next Saturday. Howe may have been concerned when Bree was afforded far too much room to lift onto the head of Bednarek, given how easily Newcastle were cut open in their 4-1 thrashing by AFC Bournemouth last time out. He first came to the rescue when receiving a deft pass from Bruno Guimaraes before Aribo hauled him down from behind for the spot-kick leveller.\", 'Newcastle': '.'}\n",

Brighton took an early lead through Georginio Rutter’s header, but were powerless as Palmer took command of the contest with a rapid hat-trick. His quadruple came in the space of 20 minutes, with Carlos Baleba’s strike to make it 3-2 swiftly cancelled out by the Chelsea talisman’s fourth goal of an extraordinary performance. The Blues climb to fourth place, a point behind Manchester City and Arsenal, while Brighton drop to eighth after suffering their first defeat of the season. Chelsea fell behind in the seventh minute when Levi Colwill’s attempted clearance deflected high into the air, and Rutter bravely outjumped Robert Sanchez to nod home. However, Palmer then took centre stage. The Blues forward had already been denied by a post and offside flag when he slotted into an empty net in the 21st minute after Nicolas Jackson pounced on Adam Webster’s loose back pass. Palmer put Chelsea ahead from the penalty spot seven minutes later after Baleba bundled over Jadon Sancho, before completing his hat-trick just after the half-hour mark with a magnificent 25-yard free-kick. Baleba halved the deficit when he punished Sanchez’s loose pass, but Palmer grabbed his and Chelsea’s fourth in the 41st minute, latching onto Sancho’s through-ball and firing past Bart Verbruggen at his near post. Palmer almost turned provider four minutes after the restart with a sublime first-time pass finding Jackson, who was brilliantly denied on the line by Webster. History-making Palmer pulls the strings once more\\nThere is no doubting who is Chelsea’s main man. Palmer completed his hat-trick in the space of only nine minutes and 46 seconds, though – but for the woodwork and offside flag – he could have done so in just two minutes. Cucurella also had an effort ruled out for offside, as did Sancho who, along with Palmer, Noni Madueke and Jackson in an unchanged and settled front four, looked dangerous every time they attacked Brighton’s high defensive line. Now with four straight wins under their belt – and a league-high 15 goals from their first six encounters – Chelsea will be eager to keep that momentum going at home to Nottingham Forest next weekend. It has certainly been an excellent start for Maresca, and with Palmer in this kind of form, the Blues look well set to challenge at the top. However, that seemed to spark Chelsea into life and Brighton always looked vulnerable to their opponents’ pace and power in attack. All four goals they conceded saw slight defensive lapses ruthlessly punished by the Blues, and in particular Palmer. First, Webster’s loose back pass led to the equaliser opener, then Baleba and Pervis Estupinan’s fouls were converted from the respective dead-ball situations by Palmer, whose fourth came after Verbruggen’s sloppy pass out from the back.

Fourth-bottom Wolves, meanwhile, are only above Ipswich on goal difference, and could drop into the relegation zone when Leicester City visit Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. How the match unfolded\\nDespite Arsenal bossing possession, Wolves created the first big chance as Nelson Semedo crossed for Pablo Sarabia, who miscued his volley over. Wolves got a huge boost on the stroke of half-time as Doherty looked to counter from an Arsenal corner, only to be felled by Lewis-Skelly. Moments after being denied by a sprawling David Raya, Matheus Cunha prodded agonisingly wide. But the momentum turned when Gomes jumped into a senseless challenge on Timber high up the pitch, receiving a second booking and giving Arsenal the impetus to press for a winner. Wolves miss golden chance\\nGoing into half-time goalless and with a one-man advantage, Wolves found themselves with a great opportunity to cause an upset and pull three points clear of the danger zone. However, Wolves showed little in attack after Sarabia's early miss, with Cunha again cutting a frustrated figure just days after his body language was criticised by Pereira following a 3-1 defeat at Chelsea. If an expectant Molineux crowd was expecting more in the second half, they were sorely disappointed as Arsenal made much of the running even with 10 men, Havertz missing another good headed chance before Wolves finally created a pair of openings for Cunha.

Mbeumo is becoming the main man at Brentford with a fifth goal in six matches and a 14th goal involvement in 15 London derby appearances in the Premier League. Mbeumo did head over Mikkel Damsgaard’s inviting delivery, but the hosts never looked like adding to their early goal. Thomas Frank’s side also never looked in danger of conceding an equalising goal, but a slice of luck for the visitors drew the contest level.

It was little surprise when he was withdrawn for Stones after 54 minutes, though another new arrival – Marmoush – enjoyed a more positive debut, showing some nice touches and linking well with Haaland. In the end, however, it was a route-one approach that paid off for City, with Ederson's long ball into the right channel earning him an assist for Haaland's goal.

Arteta’s side dominated the opening period and were rewarded with two goals, though how easy the Gunners found their way into Leicester’s box seemingly saw them take their foot off the pedal, and that slackness was punished emphatically by Justin. Having seen their two-goal advantage evaporate, and having been on the wrong end of a moment of individual brilliance from Justin, Arsenal burst back into life, only to see several efforts met with a string of impressive saves by Hermansen. Ethan Nwaneri and Riccardo Calafiori saw efforts saved, with Leicester, in their attempts to salvage a point, resulting in the dark arts that Arsenal had shown in their draw with City. But that ultimately came back to bite the Foxes, with Arsenal channelling their frustrations into a goalscoring reaction during a long period of added time, albeit helped by the misfortune of Ndidi and Justin. Foxes fall just short\\nAhead of kick-off, Steve Cooper said that Arsenal’s showing against Manchester City was the level he aspired to reach with his Leicester side, and the Foxes’ display at the Emirates proved they can be match for most teams. Martinelli’s opener came at the end of an endless wave of Arsenal pressure, though Cooper felt his side should have been awarded a free-kick prior to the goal, with Jamie Vardy having been in a tussle with William Saliba. However, the Foxes emerged from the tunnel a completely different team to the one that had been battered and bruised in the first half, with Justin’s first goal the slice of luck Leicester believe they richly deserved before the defender added his second, which was anything but lucky. For all of Leicester’s perseverance, they came undone at the final moment. Arsenal’s never-ending pressure finally told, but the Foxes’ second-half performance showed promising signs for the future.

      "{'Newcastle': '.', 'Man City': 'Anthony Gordon’s second-half penalty saw Newcastle United come from behind to frustrate Premier League leaders Manchester City in a 1-1 draw at St James’ Park. Josko Gvardiol had put City ahead with a neat close-range finish in the 35th minute of Saturday’s contest. Both sides saw chances go begging as they pushed for a winner, with Erling Haaland heading at Nick Pope late on as the Norwegian failed to score for the first time in the league this season. Pep Guardiola’s side drop to second in the table on 14 points after they were overtaken by Liverpool, who won 2-1 at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Aston Villa could also go above the champions with a win at Ipswich Town while Arsenal are level on points with City. How the match unfolded\\nAfter a scrappy start, Gvardiol put City ahead when he skilfully dragged the ball away from Dan Burn before slotting a low strike into the bottom-right corner, with every City player other than Bernardo Silva playing a part in the build-up to the goal. Joelinton almost clawed Newcastle level on the stroke of half-time, bringing down a corner on the stretch, only to see his rifled effort pushed away by Ederson, though the City goalkeeper played his part in the hosts’ equaliser. While Sean Longstaff dragged Newcastle’s best chance wide, Eddie Howe’s side were indebted to Pope at the other end as he punched the ball clear of Haaland before denying Silva and then collecting a header from City’s striker in the closing stages. And while the Brazilian continued to be a thorn in City’s side after the break, it was Gordon who proved the difference maker. Guardiola’s midfield headache\\nAll eyes were on City’s midfield after the news that Rodri would be missing the rest of the season after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) against Arsenal last Sunday. Guardiola described Rodri as “irreplaceable” and opted to change his formation in favour of a slightly more defensive set-up to make up for the Spaniard’s absence. Newcastle’s equaliser lit a fire in the hosts, and as they pushed for a winner, Guardiola was forced to change things again, with Phil Foden’s introduction giving City the control they had lacked at the start of the second half. Foden’s involvement also allowed more space for Haaland, who saw opportunities come his way later on, though he was unable to extend his recent hot streak in front of goal.

In the end, it was some good defensive work from Murillo, Milenkovic and Aina that ensured a precious win for the hosts. Familiar problems for Saints\\nAfter a fighting display against Manchester United at Old Trafford where they conceded three goals in 12 minutes to lose 3-1, Southampton would have expected to build on the positives at the City Ground.

It is a draw that takes Ipswich into 15th place on four points, while Villa – who would have joined leaders Liverpool on 15 points had they held on – sit fifth. How the match unfolded\\nIpswich wasted no time in getting the home fans on their feet. Jack Clarke, on his first Premier League start for Ipswich, cut back for Delap to slam in, with Emiliano Martinez unable to keep the low strike out. Clarke then spurned a good chance to restore Ipswich’s lead when he headed over from close range, but Watkins made no such mistake at the other end when he nodded in from Leon Bailey’s excellent right-wing cross in the 32nd minute. Pau Torres made a fantastic block to deny Wes Burns a winner, with Arijanet Muric called into action to keep out Ross Barkley’s rasping drive before Martinez held onto Jack Taylor’s fierce stoppage-time strike. Ipswich were comeback experts last season in the Championship, and Kieran McKenna’s team have now shown their courage in successive top-tier matches to salvage a point from each of them. Sam Morsy, their hero against Southampton last week, was perhaps fortunate to stay on the pitch this time out after a rash lunge on Jaden Philogene, but Ipswich made their luck count. All Ipswich need now is that first win of the campaign, and they will hope it comes against West Ham United next time out. While he would have probably been expected to make the diving save to his left to keep out Phillips’ first-time shot from the edge of the box, Martinez had little right to sprawl ahead of Delap and stick out a long left leg to divert the Ipswich striker’s attempt wide in a one-v-one, with Ipswich having found a way beyond Villa’s high line. Martinez was hardly to blame when Delap dragged Ipswich level, and though Unai Emery will no doubt be annoyed that his team could not hold on, in the Argentinian, he has one of the best in the business to call on, with a UEFA Champions League encounter against Bayern Munich coming up before Villa’s next top-flight match, against Manchester United.

The Cherries climb to sixth place and within a point of Eddie Howe’s side, who remain fourth after missing the chance to leapfrog third-place Nottingham Forest. How the match unfolded\\nBournemouth made a bright start and were ahead after just six minutes when Antoine Semenyo cut the ball back for Kluivert to sweep past Martin Dubravka. The Cherries thought they had increased their advantage after 61 minutes when Ouattara volleyed in David Brooks’ cross. Nevertheless, Bournemouth did get their third goal in stoppage time as Kluivert flashed a magnificent strike beyond a flat-footed Dubravka. Although, they knew they faced a tough task in breaking down a Bournemouth side that had gone nine league games without defeat. Not only that, but ex-Cherries boss Howe had never beaten his former employers in the Premier League, so this was always going to be a difficult one for the Magpies.

The win moved Liverpool seven points clear of second-place Arsenal, who host Aston Villa later on Saturday, while Brentford remain 11th after suffering late heartbreak. How the match unfolded\\nBrentford almost made a rapid start just five minutes in. The unmarked Mikkel Damsgaard could not make the required contact, however, after Yoane Wissa’s slight deflection on Mads Roerslev's dangerous delivery. Salah went close when his 89th-minute curler from the edge of the D narrowly evaded Mark Flekken's bottom-right corner, though Slot's side would soon be saved by Nunez. Alexander-Arnold's driving run teed up the late first when his pull back from the right found Nunez, who converted from close range – he repeated the dose soon after when combining with Elliott and thumping past Flekken. Battling Brentford undone late on\\nBrentford rarely looked like a side that had managed just one win across their previous eight matches in all competitions – in fact, Thomas Frank's side shaded the opening stages on Saturday. Bryan Mbeumo was the chief tormentor of Liverpool, forcing an early caution for Kostas Tsimikas just minutes after his inside run freed Roerslev, whose delightful delivery should have ended with Damsgaard tapping home at the back post. Brentford star Mbeumo again had the beating of Tsimikas, twice testing the hands of Alisson in the opening 20 minutes, before the forward's wide free-kick was glanced over by Christian Norgaard. Another Mbeumo free-kick with 20 minutes remaining had Alisson scrambling to parry the cross before the Liverpool goalkeeper denied the Cameroonian's tame strike and a routine header in the closing stages. Yet, for all of Brentford's promise in attack from Mbeumo and Wissa, they were undone late on by Nunez's deadly finishing as the league leaders finally found the quality that has them in control of the title race. Having managed to come back in the closing stages in the midweek draw with Manchester City, a reverse outcome here will leave Frank desperate for a result when his side travel to Crystal Palace in eight days' time. Gakpo headed straight at Flekken early on after an inviting cross from Luis Diaz, who made a mess of his header from Ibrahima Konate's lob shortly after. Flekken tipped another deflected effort from Ryan Gravenberch wide before Szoboszlai saw one low strike saved and another from outside the area crash off the woodwork. A rapid counter-attack kick-started by Szoboszlai should have allowed Gakpo to convert Salah's well-timed pass into the box, though the Dutchman wasted a left-footed opening by touching wide of the onrushing Flekken. Diaz's fizzing shot was then pushed away once more in the second half by Flekken – who survived penalty appeals after contesting for the loose ball.\", 'Liverpool': \"Darwin Nunez proved Liverpool's late hero as his stoppage-time double fired the Premier League leaders to a 2-0 victory away at Brentford.

Villa play the villains once again\\nMuch of the talk surrounding the fixture was Arsenal’s pursuit of leaders Liverpool, but Aston Villa lived up to their name to keep their own European ambitions alive. Having posed a threat to Arsenal in recent fixtures against them, Watkins was again troubling the hosts’ defence early on, who were without William Saliba through injury. Unai Emery’s gameplan seemingly allowed Arsenal to enjoy possession but looked to hit them on the break. Watkins proved a tricky customer to handle for Jurrien Timber and Gabriel Magalhaes, with the England international almost punishing Thomas Partey’s wayward throw-in just two minutes before Martinelli opened the scoring. Though handed a hammer blow by Havertz’s goal, the visitors continued to be a threat in the final third and grabbed a goal through Tielemans, with Emery’s substitute at half-time, Digne, providing the assist. Watkins scored in their 2-0 win over the Gunners last year and got himself on the scoresheet again with a fine finish. The Villans could have won it late on when Lamare Bogarde’s strike was spilled by Raya. Villa will be hopeful of building on their display against West Ham United in their next Premier League encounter next Sunday. Club reports\\nArsenal report | Villa report.'}\n",

      "{'Everton': \"Everton old boy Anthony Gordon saw a penalty saved on his return to Goodison Park as Newcastle United were held to a 0-0 draw. After James Tarkowski's foolish foul on Sandro Tonali gave Gordon, who left Everton for Newcastle in January 2023, his opportunity from 12 yards, he could not find a way past England team-mate Jordan Pickford. The save from Pickford was heartily celebrated by the Everton fans, though their frustration was directed at referee Craig Pawson midway through the second half, when Dominic Calvert-Lewin felt he too should have had a penalty. A point nudges Sean Dyche's side further clear of the relegation zone in 16th, while Newcastle can at least take solace in a place in the top six, leapfrogging Fulham. That decision was given following a VAR review, and referee Pawson was soon called to the pitchside monitor before awarding a penalty after Tarkowski tangled with Tonali. But Pickford won the battle of wits with Gordon from the spot, diving to his left and keeping out a tame effort with his legs. Everton wanted a penalty of their own in the second half as Calvert-Lewin went down under Dan Burn’s challenge when he looked certain to tuck in following Nick Pope’s save. Team-mates save toiling Tarkowski\\nCalvert-Lewin and Everton thought they should have had the opportunity to take all three points, but outside of that incident, they created precious few clear chances and were perhaps fortunate to come away with a goalless draw. That was perhaps not a result many would have expected given the makeshift nature of the Everton defence. After beating Crystal Palace on Jarrad Branthwaite's return to the team last week, they lost both the centre-back and Vitalii Mykolenko to injury, leaving Tarkowski as the last remaining member of Dyche's first-choice back four, with club captain Seamus Coleman also out. As it was, Tarkowski was grateful for his team-mates for their contributions to the clean sheet as he struggled throughout, most notably when wrestling Tonali to the ground. Pickford saved his captain on that occasion, while Michael Keane stepped across to make a vital challenge on Joelinton soon afterwards. More ruthless opposition might have made Tarkowski – who did make an important block late on from Miguel Almiron – and Everton pay. This was a hard-earned clean sheet but hardly a blueprint moving forward, and Dyche will be wanting Tarkowski especially to cut out the silly mistakes when the Toffees return to action at Ipswich Town later this month.

Ouattara was credited with Bournemouth's second and Semenyo clinched the third in a wonderful first-half performance with a fine solo effort.

Bournemouth forwards' delight as Evanilson gets off the mark\\nBournemouth forked out a reported £40. 2million to Porto for Evanilson in the summer transfer window as they sought a replacement for Dominic Solanke, who was sold to Tottenham Hotspur. The 24-year-old failed to score in his first four Premier League appearances and missed a penalty as the Cherries fell to a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea earlier this month. But there were no signs of a forward lacking in confidence when he brilliantly steered home after showing an almost telepathic understanding with Tavernier.

While Evanilson will rightly take credit for a fine opener, question marks will be asked of how the Southampton defence just completely lost concentration, too.

West Ham, however, regained composure and made their dominance pay when Mohammed Kudus restored the lead just before half-time. Captain Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paqueta added to the scoreline after the break as the hosts ultimately claimed a comprehensive triumph to end a poor run of form that had seen them fail to register a win across September. A convincing defeat for Kieran McKenna’s Ipswich means they remain winless and hover just one point above the bottom three in 17th position, while West Ham rise to 12th in the early league table.

However, Brentford refused to lie down and Yoane Wissa pulled a goal back in the 82nd minute to set up a grandstand finish. In the second minute of stoppage time, Christian Norgaard headed in Keane Lewis-Potter’s cross to snatch a share of the spoils for Thomas Frank’s side. Man City sit sixth in the table, having failed to capitalise on Newcastle United not playing until Wednesday, while Brentford moved up to 10th following their dramatic fightback. How the match unfolded\\nDespite City’s bright start, Brentford went closest to breaking the deadlock, with Stefan Ortega getting down well to push away Bryan Mbeumo’s low drive. Both sides went close after the break - Savinho struck the post following a swift counter, while Josko Gvardiol made a superb last-ditch intervention to deny Wissa. In the 65th minute, Damsgaard was thwarted by the offside flag, and, within 60 seconds, City were in front as Foden brilliantly cushioned Kevin De Bruyne’s fierce cross beyond goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Nathan Ake’s superb goalline block then denied Wissa an immediate response before City doubled their lead. Savinho robbed Mads Roerslev of possession before Flekken parried his fierce strike to Foden, who made no mistake from close range. The Bees halved the deficit as Roerslev kept a deep cross alive by cushioning the ball into the six-yard box for Wissa to neatly tuck beyond Ortega. The hosts also came within inches of winning the game, but Ake cleared Mbeumo’s last-second drive off the line. Wissa landmark strike launches Bees fightback\\nBrentford found themselves in increasingly unfamiliar territory. Having only recently been unbeaten at the Gtech Community Stadium all season, they welcomed the defending Premier League champions having lost their last three matches in all competitions on home soil. Nevertheless, the Bees more than held their own against Guardiola’s resurgent side, with only a combination of impressive last-ditch City defending and the offside flag denying them the game’s opening goal. Even after falling behind, Frank’s side refused to lie down and continued to generate a decent attacking threat. It eventually culminated in their route back into the contest, with Wissa’s finish his 37th Premier League goal - making him Brentford’s all-time top scorer in the division as he surpassed Ivan Toney. Had it not been for Ake’s impressive blocks, Brentford’s day could have been even better but, with Premier League leaders Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur the next two visitors to the Gtech, the Bees will enter those matches with plenty of momentum. City had not won back-to-back Premier League away matches since August, but quickly settled into their stride against Brentford. However, there was to be a late twist as a couple of slight defensive lapses were ruthlessly pounced upon by the stubborn Bees. Wissa was completely unmarked to drag them back into the contest, while Norgaard stole a march on his marker to head home the equaliser.

Trent Alexander-Arnold's loose ball was cut out by Martinez, who exchanged passes with Bruno Fernandes before firing in off the crossbar.

Liverpool get cold feet\\nSunday's match was thrown into doubt when heavy snowfall struck Merseyside and, for much of the contest, it seemed the cold weather might have got to Liverpool's stars. Aside from a two-minute blitz in which they created good opportunities for both Gakpo and Mac Allister, the leaders failed to turn up the heat in the first half. Slot's half-time team talk failed to have the revitalising effect the home fans desired, with Alexander-Arnold – who struggled all match – guilty of a mistake in the build-up to Martinez's opener. Gakpo's quickfire equaliser stirred Liverpool into life and the Anfield crowd were in fine voice when Salah gave them the advantage. However, the Reds' frailties on the right continued to show, and it was no surprise when United's equaliser came via another raid down that side. Alexander-Arnold was withdrawn for Bradley shortly after another dangerous United attack came to nothing, and his struggles summed up what was a frustrating day for Slot's men. While they were undoubtedly aided by Liverpool producing one of their most tepid displays of the season, United showed plenty of fight to reduce the Anfield crowd to groans of frustration, and they had already passed up several good chances before Martinez put them ahead.

City grabbed what proved to be the vital third goal with eight minutes remaining as Doku cut inside from the left before rifling beyond Leno from the edge of the box, even if Muniz's subsequent deflected effort ensured a tense conclusion. And City's 49-match unbeaten home run in all competitions appeared under threat when Pereira broke the deadlock following a neatly worked Fulham move. Wasteful Fulham made to pay\\nAlthough they gave a hugely positive account of themselves, Fulham will definitely depart the Etihad with a sense of what might have been. Indeed, but for profligate finishing, the Cottagers could have moved level on points with City after a superb run of form lifted them into the top half of the Premier League table. Fulham always looked dangerous going forward, fashioning chances worth an Expected Goals (xG) of 2. 4, and the breakthrough strike was a stylish one as Jimenez's clever backheel set up Pereira. Even with those setbacks, Marco Silva's side stayed in the match with the late goal from Muniz, but they did not quite have enough to rescue a point and fell to their first defeat since losing at Manchester United on the opening day.

The Jamaica international scored in the 76th minute, restoring Villa’s lead after Stephy Mavididi’s equaliser, as he turned in the all-important goal from an Ian Maatsen cross. After a cagey first half with few chances, the match finally opened up after the break, with Ross Barkley striking home the opener for Villa just before the hour mark. The defeat keeps Leicester in 19th with 14 points, two behind Wolverhampton Wanderers in 17th, while Villa move up to eighth on 32 points. How the match unfolded\\nBoth sides struggled to create anything of note in the first half, with Ollie Watkins' deflected effort the clearest opening until stoppage time. Watkins’ cross created problems for the Leicester defence, and goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk had to present a strong fist to stop Matty Cash’s strike from the edge of the box. He scored on the rebound after Villa custodian Emiliano Martinez kept out Jamie Vardy’s initial attempt. Injury-hit Villa get the job done\\nVilla were on a slight blip before Saturday, with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City their only win in four outings, and Unai Emery had to contend with injuries and suspension as his side kicked off 2025 with a victory. Emery already had centre-back Pau Torres sidelined for up to two months while Diego Carlos and Jaden Philogene also missed out with knocks going into the match. Morgan Rogers and Jhon Duran, who have 13 league goals between them this season, were both suspended, and the Villa manager’s woes were then compounded when captain John McGinn was forced off injured less than 20 minutes in. But Barkley, in his first start since a goalscoring display against Crystal Palace in November, and Bailey, with his first goal of the season, stepped up for Emery’s side in their moment of difficulty. Watkins and substitute Emiliano Buendia also had opportunities to increase the home side’s advantage in the resulting chaos, but the Argentinian scuffed his shot into Leicester’s defence before Watkins blazed over from close range. Spirited displays against champions Man City and Villa aside, they are in desperate need of points, with only rock-bottom Southampton, on six points, below them in the Premier League table. They have conceded 16 goals in their last six matches and their defensive frailties were again on display at Villa Park as Danish centre-back Vestergaard’s poor defensive header from a Youri Tielemans cross led to the opener.

Savinho also teed up Haaland’s second to make it 3-0 after 55 minutes, before Phil Foden ruthlessly punished a mistake at the back by the Hammers three minutes later.

Cole Palmer fired the visitors ahead after 14 minutes at Selhurst Park, converting his 13th league goal of the season after a brilliant run by Jadon Sancho. Mateta had been Palace\\'s chief threat throughout and he ultimately drew his side level when converting from Eberechi Eze\\'s pass eight minutes from time. The draw moves Palace six points clear of the bottom three in 15th place, while Chelsea stay fourth, just one point ahead of in-form Newcastle United, who won 2-1 at Tottenham Hotspur earlier in the day. Jackson and Acheampong then went close, while a brief Palace flurry led to a Mateta effort that was deflected wide. But Mateta had the last word, tapping in Eze\\'s pass after a slick move that also involved Ismaila Sarr to secure a valuable point for Palace. Palace find a way\\nThe Eagles could not find much attacking momentum in the first half, with Eze initially unable to create chances in the way he so often does. Palace were perhaps fortunate to not fall further behind after a few near misses at the other end that kept the deficit at one while they were working their way into the game. While this was not a performance that contained some of the flowing play they so impressively ended last season with, Oliver Glasner will be pleased his side found a way to keep their points tally ticking over. Palace have only lost two of their last 12 league matches and positive results have been secured against the likes of Spurs, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Brighton & Hove Albion and now Chelsea. Matches like this one are unlikely to decide whether Palace are going to be relegated – their next league fixture, away to Leicester City, is a more important one – but the level of performances over recent weeks suggest they should be good enough to avoid a real scrap. And in Mateta, they certainly have a striker much of the league will be envious of. With Wesley Fofana and Benoit Badiashile out of action, Maresca looks likely to turn to Acheampong for further appearances, especially after the teenager acquitted himself well at Selhurst Park, notoriously a tough venue for visiting teams.

The Blues have not necessarily done as much wrong as the results in their three matches coming into this one suggested and they also did plenty right here, with some lovely play and almost full control of the contest for the first hour. But Chelsea could not take their chances or see out the win, with Palmer’s goal ending up as their only shot on target. The 18-year-old defender has impressed in UEFA Conference League action for the Blues this season and slotted into the backline seamlessly, taking the most touches of any player on the pitch in the first half and forming part of a solid defensive effort overall.

Saka himself then sealed the triumph with a fine first-time finish, with Arsenal remaining third, behind league leaders Liverpool and Manchester City, while Southampton sit 19th. Despite the Arsenal onslaught, Southampton registered the first attempt on target, though Kyle Walker-Peters’ speculative effort was no test for David Raya. And against the run of play, Southampton took the lead through substitute Archer. But Southampton’s joy was short-lived after Flynn Downes’ errant pass was punished by Havertz, who netted his seventh consecutive goal in as many matches on home soil. Ten minutes later substitute Martinelli’s finished from close range, a goal which was confirmed by VAR after a check for offside, to put Arsenal ahead. Southampton threatened again, with Taylor Harwood-Bellis rattling the crossbar from a corner, but a heavy touch at the other end from Yukinari Sugawara’s fell kindly into the path of Saka, who sent a right-footed effort into the far corner to wrap up the points and secure a 400th home win for Arsenal in the Premier League. Arsenal survive Saints scare\\nHaving been run close by Leicester City last weekend, Arsenal almost failed to learn their lesson against another promoted team this time around. A dominant opening to proceedings saw referee Harrington wave away two penalty appeals, with Sterling going down under the challenge of Jan Bednarek, before Havertz was then hauled down in the box by Walker-Peters, much to the frustration of the home supporters. But for all of Arsenal’s possession, they created very few chances, often forced to take on efforts from distance that were repelled by Southampton’s stern rearguard. The introduction of Martinelli, debutant Mikel Merino and Leandro Trossard saw the Gunners take control, with the latter continuing his bright start to the season with a well-taken effort. Martin’s calm approach warrants positivity\\nRussell Martin called for calm ahead of kick-off, with his side only in the early stages of their Premier League return, and there was certainly much improvement compared with Monday’s horror show at AFC Bournemouth. Southampton were able to navigate a nervy opening period to maintain their hopes of earning a scalp against a title contender, and Archer’s goal was the least the visitors deserved for sticking valiantly at their task, though their good work was undone shortly after. A criticism of Martin’s side this season has been their risky, possession-based approach, and that proved their downfall when Downes’ sloppy pass was picked off by Saka, who then fed Havertz for Arsenal’s equaliser. Martin can take confidence from the showing in north London, but Southampton have now gone 20 Premier League matches without a victory.

Brighton responded well to going behind, with Simon Adingra curling wide, but the hosts struggled to test David Raya. That changed around the hour mark, when Saliba caught Joao Pedro as he attempted a headed clearance. Referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot, and Brighton’s forward duly sent Raya the wrong way. Yankuba Minteh could have won it late on for Brighton after a driving run down the right, but his low shot flashed across the face of goal, with Kaoru Mitoma unable to get a decisive touch. Another draw on the board\\nBrighton had been looking to end a run of three Premier League draws in a row, and after falling behind so early on, another draw may not seem a bad result. The Seagulls are now without a win in eight matches though, and given the positions they got into against Arsenal, Fabian Hurzeler may feel they should have come away with three points. The half-time introductions of Georginio Rutter and Minteh helped to make a difference, spurring Joao Pedro on after a quiet first half. Brighton’s hopes of European football next season may look slim after their recent run, but Hurzeler will take heart from this performance and aim to get back to winning ways when they return to Premier League action against Ipswich Town on January 16. Absences tell for Arsenal\\nMany of the pre-match questions continued to focus on how Arsenal would continue to cope without the influential Bukayo Saka, but he was not the only absentee, as Kai Havertz, who has scored in each of his last four league appearances against Brighton, also not involved. While Brighton were able to get their centre-forward more involved as the game wore on, however, Jesus’ influence faded. Thomas Partey did not look particularly comfortable in the role, and Brighton tried to exploit that. Club reports\\nBrighton report | Arsenal report.', 'Arsenal': '.'}\n",

Villa stutter despite Watkins boost\\nVilla’s home form is of considerable importance to their bid to qualify for the Champions League for a second successive season. Watkins, in for the suspended Duran, was a bright spark for Emery\\'s hosts. Watkins played like he had a point to prove after a stint on the bench, showing off his all-round game with nicely weighted pass for the second goal, which was finished off by Rogers. Emery’s men will be hugely disappointed not to see the game out, as they were the superior side for much of the encounter and failed to make a dominant start to the second half count. They started brightly here, looking dangerous in transition through Adingra and Joao Pedro, though they still struggled to deal with periods of Villa dominance either side of the interval.

The Portuguese forward netted his first league goal since the opening weekend after just nine minutes at Selhurst Park, darting in behind to pick out the bottom-left corner. It could have been a different story, though, as Palace attacker Eddie Nketiah had a goal ruled out for offside inside the first minute. A sixth victory from seven matches moves Arne Slot’s men four points clear at the top of the table before title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City play later on Saturday, while Palace remain without a win in 18th. How the match unfolded\\nJust 22 seconds were on the clock when Palace had the ball in the net after Nketiah latched onto Ismaila Sarr’s low cross to dink Alisson, but he had strayed offside. Henderson then tipped Trent Alexander-Arnold’s low drive wide before Palace almost equalised on the stroke of half-time, Alisson getting down sharply to push Sarr’s low drive away. Palace soon asserted themselves into the match though, with Alisson having to make a trio of saves in quick succession to keep out Nketiah, Eberechi Eze and Chalobah to protect the clean sheet. The Brazilian was forced off through injury in the final 15 minutes, but Will Hughes and Eze could not beat replacement Vitezslav Jaros, on for his debut, with their long-range efforts. The wait goes on\\nIt was always going to be a tough task for Palace if they wanted to get their first win of the Premier League season against high-flying Liverpool, though you could not fault the fans for having hope after beating the Reds at Anfield towards the end of last season. The celebrations may have been cut short after Nketiah’s very early disallowed goal, but the moment showed Palace were capable of causing their in-form visitors problems. But Palace looked more settled after a double change in the second half saw them switch formation, with the introduction of Jean-Philippe Mateta also providing them with another focal point up top. It is no surprise that their best chances came after Oliver Glasner’s tactical switch, but even with the small boost given by Alisson’s departure, they still could not find a way past Jaros, who had a calm presence after his unexpected introduction. Palace remain in the relegation zone heading into the international break, but their manager will already be thinking ahead to a pivotal trip to Nottingham Forest as they await their first three points. Van Dijk was assured, easily reading Palace’s attempts to play in behind to sweep the danger away, while Ibrahima Konate took the more proactive approach on the press as part of an impressive defence that has still only conceded two goals.

With big matches ahead, one worry for Slot will be the muscle injury to Alisson, who cut a frustrated figure when he threw his gloves to the floor as he was forced off late in the game. Slot may not believe his team are ready to be included among the title contenders just yet, but they have laid down some impressive groundwork to go into the international break top of the league.

      "{'Brentford': 'Arsenal made a perfect start to 2025 by coming from behind to earn a 3-1 victory at Brentford on New Year’s Day that moved them up to second in the Premier League table. Mikel Arteta’s men did not have it all their own way, with Bryan Mbeumo continuing his fine campaign by netting an 11th league goal of the season to give the Bees a shock 13th-minute lead. But in-form Gabriel Jesus restored parity just before the half-hour mark, heading in from close range after Thomas Partey’s effort was spilled by Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Wednesday’s triumph sees Arsenal leapfrog Nottingham Forest in the table to move six points behind leaders Liverpool, while Brentford - who have now gone four top-flight matches without a win - remain in 12th place. How the match unfolded\\nBrentford went ahead against the run of play when Mikkel Damsgaard won possession following a poor Martin Odegaard pass and found Mbeumo, who directed his shot inside David Raya’s near post on the Arsenal goalkeeper’s return to his former club. One-way traffic soon ensued after the break, with Arsenal capitalising on Brentford’s defensive hesitance with another set-piece - this time Merino fired home after Flekken failed to deal with a 50th-minute corner. Nathan Collins’ headed clearance found Martinelli, who controlled with his thigh before firing impressively into the bottom corner, with the goal awarded on pitch and confirmed following a VAR review to check whether the Brentford defender had been fouled. Bees stung by their own defensive errors\\nHaving made the Gtech Community Stadium a fortress at the start of the season, Brentford have now lost consecutive home matches, and Thomas Frank’s side will be frustrated with elements of this performance. The Bees were content with allowing Arsenal to dominate the ball early on, instead showing their threat on the break. Lewis-Potter’s cross was pushed away by Raya with Mbeumo lurking behind him, and the Brentford talisman would make his mark in similar fashion soon after. But Frank will be annoyed at the way his side conceded the leveller having failed to clear their lines on multiple occasions, with Sepp van den Berg’s slow reaction to Flekken’s stop ruthlessly punished by Jesus, who netted his sixth goal in four matches in all competitions. More defensive errors followed during Arsenal’s most potent attacking threat, with Flekken flapping at a corner that saw Merino pounce, and despite Martinelli’s finish being a moment of individual quality, the strike came from a poor clearance from Collins. Brentford rarely threatened after Arsenal’s third with Mathias Jensen narrowly missing a flighted ball into the box late on. The Bees could do with a return to winning ways when they face Southampton on Saturday. Despite a stuttering start against their London rivals, the Gunners looked measured in their approach as they looked to break down Brentford’s stern defensive rearguard, with the hosts’ resolve eventually breached through Jesus. It was Nwaneri’s corner that caused confusion in the Brentford box that led to Merino’s goal, before his teasing delivery resulted in Martinelli putting the result beyond doubt.

There were flashes of Man City excellence. Haaland embarked on an impressive run before he dragged wide midway through the first half, while the Norwegian also headed at Stolarczyk after great work from Bernardo Silva down the left flank. First, the Brazilian finished brilliantly from a tight angle to break the deadlock, before he supplied the left-footed cross from which Haaland made sure of the points. In years gone by, a Man City opener against one of the teams struggling down at the bottom would likely have resulted in Guardiola’s team putting their foot on the pedal. Instead, they rather laboured to a much-needed win – just their second victory in 14 games across all competitions – though getting that triumph on the board likely mattered more for Guardiola than the nature of the performance.

And Rutter proved the difference for Brighton’s winner, battling to the byline past three Spurs defenders before lunging to lift a cross, which looped up off Rodrigo Bentancur, towards the six-yard box, where Welbeck was waiting to cap off a stunning comeback win.

Further joy followed down that same side as Mitoma, who also created a glorious chance for Welbeck in the first half, then tested the hands of Vicario with a low drive. It was Mitoma again who smartly ghosted into an inside pocket of space before sliding through for Rutter, who made the most out of a half-chance to punish Spurs' fragile defence. Hurzeler will know his team are by no means the finished article, with numerous concerns at the back, though Rutter and Mitoma's attacking brilliance will have Brighton hopeful of further climbing the table when they visit Newcastle United after the international break. Werner burst through Brighton's high line before his sliding across evaded the stretch of Johnson after less than a minute – and that was a sign of things to come.

The home side took the lead seven minutes after the break as Eze struck a powerful effort past Ramsdale from just outside the penalty area, and they held on for all three points. A win for Palace sees them move above Everton into 15th position, while Southampton remain bottom with just one win and six points to show for their efforts across the first half of the season.

However, despite going behind, Palace responded well and could easily have been ahead by half-time, having dominated large parts of the opening half and created plenty of chances. Mateta grew into the game too, often getting the better of Jan Bednarek in the air and drawing in Southampton’s three central defenders, which in turn created space for the likes of Sarr and Eze to exploit. Eze capped his own fine performance, which included a skilful dink over Taylor Harwood-Bellis to win a free kick, with a fantastic goal out of nothing, and his form may prove crucial in the early parts of 2025 as Palace look to continue their recovery from a difficult start and move further up the table. Glasner will hope his side, boosted by the return of Guehi, can continue keep up the momentum from this display when they host Chelsea in a London derby on January 4.

Palace end 2024 on a high\\xa0\\nMarc Guehi’s suspension for this game was a blow for Oliver Glasner’s men, and his absence was keenly felt early on, as Palace initially struggled with Southampton’s direct approach and conceded a very soft goal by their standards. Mateta grew into the game too, often getting the better of Jan Bednarek in the air and drawing in Southampton’s three central defenders, which in turn created space for the likes of Sarr and Eze to exploit. Indeed, after a strong opening Saints were second best as they struggled to contain a Palace onslaught and they continue to concede soft goals, with weak defending contributing to Chalobah’s goal and a failure to deal with a looping aerial ball proving detrimental for the second. A home victory against Brentford in their first match of 2025 next Saturday is of the upmost importance if Southampton are going to mount an improbable escape from relegation in the second half of the season.

Players such as Kaoru Mitoma, Joao Pedro, Enciso, Georginio Rutter and Adingra were all frustrated by Brentford, who become only the second visiting team to keep a clean sheet at the Amex this season, after Ipswich Town. Brighton's sudden loss of cutting edge is something that must be addressed if they are to push for Europe in the new year. The Seagulls did receive one major boost, however, when Solly March returned to action following an injury lay-off lasting over a year. However, they headed to Brighton with the lowest number of away points, with just one point secured on their travels, via a 0-0 draw at Everton in November.

Villa played the majority of the match with 10 men after Jhon Duran was sent off for violent conduct midway through the first half, having aimed a needless kick at Fabian Schar. A third straight Premier League win moves Eddie Howe’s team into fifth place with 29 points, as Villa slip to ninth. Matters got worse for Villa when Duran left his foot in on Schar in the 32nd minute, with Anthony Taylor brandishing a straight red card and VAR confirming the referee’s decision. Joelinton had a strike chalked off due to Isak carrying the ball out of play, then Emiliano Martinez made a miraculous save to deny Sandro Tonali just before half-time. However, there was nothing Martinez could do when Newcastle went 2-0 up in the 59th minute, Isak tapping Murphy's cross home from six yards out. Newcastle's third goal was delayed when Ezri Konsa's clearance deflected in off Guimaraes but was disallowed for handball after a VAR review, but Joelinton eventually made it 3-0 with a curling effort in stoppage time. Gordon, who should arguably have had a couple of goals at Portman Road last time out, wasted no time in getting on the scoresheet here, giving Martinez no chance with a wonderful curling effort from the left corner of the box. The in-form winger only had himself to blame, though, when he crashed against the crossbar with Martinez grounded mere moments later. Duran gets unwelcome Christmas card\\nDuran finally looked to have established himself as a regular starter for Villa, scoring 12 goals in all competitions this season – seven of them in the league – to displace Ollie Watkins up front. Indeed, Thursday's match was the fourth in a row in which Villa left Watkins out of their starting line-up in the Premier League, the first time that has happened since he arrived from Brentford back in 2020. Villa always faced an uphill task from there, though they almost forced a nervy finish when Pau Torres headed just over at 2-0 down, seconds after Murphy had nearly put through his own net.

Though they could have taken the lead early on through Soler, West Ham were second best for large parts of the first 45, with Bowen posing the greatest threat. Bowen stole a march on his marker to meet Fullkrug’s flick-on from Tomas Soucek’s header into the area, and duly turned in a neat finish. West Ham and Lopetegui will hope they can build on this victory in their next outing on Sunday, when they welcome league leaders Liverpool to the London Stadium.

      "{'Aston Villa': \"Aston Villa and Manchester United shared the spoils in an underwhelming 0-0 draw at Villa Park. Marcus Rashford, who was perhaps fortunate not to be sent off, and Youri Tielemans also went close, but neither team were able to find the breakthrough. Unai Emery's side sit fifth on 14 points, while United are 14th on eight points, which is their lowest-ever tally after seven matches of a Premier League campaign. The hosts were forced into an early defensive change when Ezri Konsa limped off, while United followed suit at half-time as Harry Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui made way. Tielemans brought a fine save out of Andre Onana after Emiliano Martinez had thwarted Rashford at the other end – with the Villa fans subsequently left incensed when the United forward escaped a second booking after a rash foul on Leon Bailey. The woodwork came to Villa's rescue in the 68th minute when Fernandes struck the crossbar with his dipping free-kick, though Philogene may have won it in stoppage time had Diogo Dalot not got in the way of his goalbound strike, and that lack of cutting edge when it mattered most was ultimately the tale of the game for both sides, though. Villa unable to build on Bayern momentum\\nVilla had plenty of reasons to be optimistic ahead of welcoming a struggling United to the west midlands. Emery’s side were fresh from their best start to a Premier League season in 16 years, as well as a famous UEFA Champions League victory over Bayern Munich on Wednesday. It looked like they would after Rogers’ early chance, but the injury to Konsa seemed to stop them in their tracks and allow United to gain a foothold in the match. Nevertheless, Villa extended their unbeaten run to eight matches in all competitions, while keeping them firmly in touch of the top four heading into the international break. At the back, United generally limited Villa to hold out for their third successive clean sheet away from home, with veteran Jonny Evans excellent.

      "{'Wolves': 'Manchester United suffered their fourth Premier League defeat in the space of five matches as Bruno Fernandes was sent off in a 2-0 defeat to a resurgent Wolverhampton Wanderers. Fernandes received his marching orders early in the second half at a misty Molineux, where Matheus Cunha bent in directly from a corner just before the hour. Cunha then teed up Hwang Hee-chan to make sure of the points deep in stoppage time. Thursday’s result marks a winning home debut for new Wolves head coach Vitor Pereira, who got one over on his Portuguese compatriot Ruben Amorim. With two wins from two under Pereira, Wolves moved – at least temporarily – into 17th, three places behind out-of-form United. How the match unfolded\\nAn early half-chance for Fernandes aside, Wolves had the better of the first half, and forced Andre Onana into the first meaningful save when he tipped over Jorgen Strand Larsen’s header. Nelson Semedo went close with a deflected long-range effort before half-time, and Wolves received a huge boost less than two minutes into the second half when the full-back was on the end of a rash challenge from Fernandes. Semedo was in the thick of it again moments later as he crossed in for Larsen to head home, but Wolves’ celebrations were cut short by the offside flag – with the VAR confirming that decision. Yet there was no such reprieve for United in the 58th minute, as Cunha curled an inswinging, right-footed corner over the bodies in a crowded box and into the far corner. Cunha raced clear on the break and squared for substitute Hwang, who slammed in his first league goal of the season. Yet that is what happened when Cunha swung his corner into the back of Onana’s net to put Wolves ahead, just a week after Son Heung-min had done the same for Tottenham Hotspur, in United’s defeat to Ange Postecoglou’s team in the EFL Cup. Fernandes pled his innocence, but he left his right boot in on Semedo when he stretched to meet a loose touch on the edge of Wolves’ box, giving referee Tony Harrington little choice but to hand him a second yellow card. Shorn of their playmaker, United surrendered territory to Wolves, and then lacked the cutting edge to respond after falling behind, with hopeful headers from Alejandro Garnacho and Harry Maguire the best they managed. United might have been handed a lifeline prior to Wolves’ second goal, when the VAR checked for a possible foul in the hosts’ box, but no on-field review was required as the Red Devils’ dismal run of form rolled on, with daunting fixtures against Newcastle United and Liverpool coming up. Pereira’s perfect start\\nTwo wins and two clean sheets from his opening two Premier League matches is all that Pereira could have hoped for after taking charge at Molineux, where the doom and gloom that was present at the end of Gary O’Neil’s tenure has well and truly lifted. Their win owed much to Cunha. Cunha then capped off a superb individual display with that assist for Hwang, meaning he has now been involved in 11 goals in his last 10 league matches, and Pereira will know that ensuring the former Atletico Madrid attacker keeps up that kind of form, while ensuring Wolves stay tight at the back, could be the key to dragging his new team away from danger. There is, however, the lingering issue of a potential ban for Cunha, who faces an FA charge after his actions in the wake of Wolves’ loss to Ipswich Town.', 'Man Utd': '.'}\n",

Curtis Jones put the Reds 2-1 up early in the second half, and Salah scored his 100th home Premier League goal to end the contest in the 82nd minute.

Liverpool immediately laid siege to the Leicester area and twice hit the frame of the goal. Robertson headed Trent Alexander-Arnold's delivery against the foot of the post, then Salah curled a shot against the crossbar.

Gakpo was frustrated by the flag when lashing home for what appeared to be Liverpool's third in the 68th minute, with a lengthy VAR check confirming the on-field decision to disallow his strike due to Nunez being offside in the build-up. But the Reds would not be denied a two-goal cushion, with Salah driving forward and stroking into the bottom-left corner. Leaders dig deep\\nLiverpool capitalised on a slip-up from Chelsea last Sunday, tearing Tottenham Hotspur apart in a 6-3 victory after their nearest title rivals were held to a goalless draw by Everton. Arne Slot made a pair of changes in advanced areas as Jones and Nunez replaced Dominik Szoboszlai and Luis Diaz, both of whom were on target at Spurs. It initially appeared that his tinkering may backfire, with the Reds producing a flat display in front of a frustrated crowd. However, Gakpo's moment of magic in first-half stoppage time was the turning point, with Liverpool utterly dominant from then on. Having been quiet by his usual standards in the first half, Salah was influential in the second, playing Mac Allister into the area in the build-up to Jones' goal and then applying his own unerring finish to net the home side's third. It brought up Salah's 100th Premier League goal at home, with 98 of those coming for Liverpool and two for Chelsea. Slot's men now prepare to face West Ham in their final league game of 2024.

Their tensions may have been heightened ahead of kick-off, with Wolves' earlier win dropping the Foxes into the bottom three, while Jamie Vardy was ruled out after sustaining an injury in training. Mavididi showed good pace to escape down the left and awareness to find the feet of Ayew, who left Robertson reeling with a swivel of his hips before finishing into the bottom-left corner. Leicester then defended stoically, only to be undone by a moment of brilliance, with Polish goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk, making his Premier League debut, left clawing at thin air when Gakpo sent a magnificent effort dipping into the far corner. Having conceded mere seconds before the half-time whistle, Leicester looked shorn of confidence after the restart and Liverpool ultimately cruised to victory, despite being far from their best.

The Nigeria international would go close with a strike from outside the box again before the end of the half as Silva’s side failed to find a breakthrough despite the introductions of Raul Jimenez and Traore in the second half. Wilson was also a threat, missing his own gilt-edged chance to snatch a win in the second half, but he could not beat Ramsdale after finding a way through Southampton’s stubborn defence.

William Saliba received a red card on the half-hour mark, giving the hosts a glorious opportunity for an upset at the Vitality Stadium. And midway through the second half, Bournemouth took that chance, with Christie breaking the deadlock in the 70th minute before Kluivert doubled their advantage from the penalty spot. Arsenal stay third, missing the chance to go top with Liverpool and Manchester City not playing until Sunday, while Bournemouth move up to 10th after collecting their third win of the season. Gabriel Martinelli almost made Bournemouth pay against the run of play, but Kepa Arrizabalaga made a sharp, low stop to keep the scoreline level.

Bournemouth find their clinical edge\\nDespite a bright start to the season, especially compared to where they were this time last year, Andoni Iraola has expressed some frustration with Bournemouth’s recent results. The Cherries carry a great attacking threat under the Spaniard, with late comebacks earlier in the season highlighting their prowess, but they have also been guilty of squandering golden chances. Semenyo was their main outlet from the start and had a hat-trick of opportunities, the best of which saw him volley over unchallenged just after the restart, as Bournemouth struggled to capitalise on their numerical advantage. Marcus Tavernier also nodded an effort wide as Bournemouth peppered crosses into the box, and it looked like it might not be their day until the substitutes entered the fray. And Iraola will see that as a step in the right direction, especially with more tough matches in Aston Villa and Man City next up.

Nicolas Jackson spurned two big chances in the first half, as he was thwarted by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and then the woodwork. Chelsea had nearly 75 per cent possession but Everton, in their first match since being taken over by The Friedkin Group, had the best two opportunities after the break, with Jack Harrison fluffing his lines before Tosin Adarabioyo made a fantastic block to deny Iliman Ndiaye.

Vardy emphatically fired it in from the spot, before Harry Winks picked out an unmarked Ayew from a corner, and he coolly slotted it home. He was pivotal in both first-half goals, forming a partnership with Manning down the left that Leicester simply could not contain. His driving run in behind showed great composure to create the space for his left-wing partner, drawing the Leicester defenders to him for the first goal. Resurgent Foxes show grit\\nThe visitors started their visit to St Mary’s with a limp display, looking like a team nowhere close to the pace of a Premier League match. Leicester were routinely carved open and looked vulnerable on every Southampton attack and particularly struggled to protect against the threat of the hosts’ left side. The Foxes looked a different animal after the break. Fatawu exemplified such an attitude when he unleashed a stunning shot from range that rattled the crossbar in the 71st minute, going millimetres away from an equaliser. In the end, it was innovation rather than tenacity that earned their winner as Winks spotted an unmarked Ayew at a corner, and he made no mistake with his chance.

The visitors hit the ground running under Pereira, who replaced Gary O’Neil earlier this week, while also notching their first ever top-flight triumph at King Power Stadium. Matheus Cunha was also on target before the break to put the contest beyond the Foxes, who suffered their first home defeat under Ruud van Nistelrooy. Wolves’ victory saw them leapfrog Ipswich Town to 18th place and move within two points of the Foxes, who remain in 17th. Leicester looked to respond after the break, with Jamie Vardy hitting the side-netting from a tight angle, before heading straight at Jose Sa minutes later. The Foxes carried the greater attacking threat for large periods of the second half, with Vardy again thwarted by the Wolves goalkeeper late on from inside the penalty area. Leicester draw first home blank\\nThe Foxes made a decent start under Van Nistelrooy, with four points from his opening two matches in charge, before the Dutchman was handed a reality check courtesy of last weekend’s resounding 4-0 defeat at Newcastle United. After Sa raced out of goal to deny Vardy early on, his side’s defensive frailties were exposed once more. Vardy went close to halving the deficit, though Toti Gomes’ excellent goalline clearance to deny him proved crucial, with the visitors quickly going down the other end and making it 3-0. However, it never looked likely that Leicester would return the favour, as they failed to find the net at home for the first time this season, with leaders Liverpool up next on Boxing Day. With Leicester struggling defensively, his new side took full advantage and demonstrated their ruthlessness and clinical edge to take a firm grasp of the contest.', 'Wolves': \"Wolverhampton Wanderers made a dream start to life under Vitor Pereira, who oversaw a 3-0 victory over Leicester City in his first Premier League match in charge. Goals from Goncalo Guedes and Rodrigo Gomes put Wolves in charge of the Midlands derby between two of the division’s bottom four sides. Matheus Cunha was also on target before the break to put the contest beyond the Foxes, who suffered their first home defeat under Ruud van Nistelrooy. Wolves’ victory saw them leapfrog Ipswich Town to 18th place and move within two points of the Foxes, who remain in 17th. How the match unfolded\\nWolves opened the scoring in the 19th minute when Nelson Semedo's lofted ball into the box was neatly hooked into the far-left corner by Guedes. The visitors doubled their advantage in the 36th minute, with a breakdown in communication between James Justin and Danny Ward allowing Gomes to bundle home Matt Doherty's searching pass. Wolves then grabbed a third goal a minute before the break, with Guedes this time turning provider for Cunha to fire home his ninth goal of the season, with the aid of a touch from Ward. The Foxes carried the greater attacking threat for large periods of the second half, with Vardy again thwarted by the Wolves goalkeeper late on from inside the penalty area. Wolves could have added further gloss to the scoreline when an unmarked Joao Gomes headed wide in the 83rd minute, though at that point, the three points were safely in the bag. Justin and Ward were then clearly on different wavelengths for Wolves’ second goal, as the former let Doherty’s hopeful ball run on, expecting his goalkeeper to come and collect. Vardy went close to halving the deficit, though Toti Gomes’ excellent goalline clearance to deny him proved crucial, with the visitors quickly going down the other end and making it 3-0. Wolves famously overturned a 3-0 half-time deficit to win 4-3 in the first Premier League meeting between the sides back in October 2003. Victory for Vitor on Premier League bow\\nFresh from four successive defeats that culminated in the departure of O’Neil, Wolves would not necessarily have been relishing the prospect of visiting a Premier League ground on which they had never previously won. Yet, within 45 minutes, Pereira had already made Wolves history. Wolves will have been wary heading into the second half, having conceded 40 Premier League goals already this season, with their only clean sheet coming in a win over bottom side Southampton. Following unsavoury endings to their two previous matches, Wolves will hope to see more of this going forward.\"}\n",

      "{'Newcastle': '.', 'Brighton': \"Brighton & Hove Albion surged to within touching distance of the Premier League's top four after Danny Welbeck proved the difference in a battling 1-0 away win over Newcastle United. Bart Verbruggen's brilliant resistance kept Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon at bay, while Dan Burn saw a late finish ruled out for offside as Brighton moved into fifth – two points adrift of the top four. A sprawling Verbruggen denied Isak when one-on-one just after the half-hour mark before Brighton scored against the run of play, Welbeck playing a one-two with in-form Rutter before poking past Nick Pope. Verbruggen again impressed when denying Gordon's whipped attempt before half-time, while Lewis Dunk blazed over from Yasin Ayari's corner after the break. Brighton continued to hold on as Isak and Joelinton were somehow denied in quick succession, with Gordon also firing straight at Verbruggen after Fabian Schar's incisive long ball through the middle. Burn was comfortably offside when lobbing Verbruggen in the dying stages, but victory came at a cost for Brighton as Welbeck left the pitch on a stretcher with nine minutes remaining after a seemingly innocuous clash with Schar. The England winger should have netted after the interval, too, but headed over when unchallenged from Isak's delicate delivery before rushing a glorious opportunity after Schar's long pass caught Brighton off-guard. Brighton show different side\\nYankuba Minteh and Kaoru Mitoma were pivotal as Brighton produced a memorable comeback against Spurs, but Hurzeler left the pair on the bench here after a short turnaround from their international duties. Dunk should have extended Brighton's lead after the interval, but he failed to make the most of a gilt-edged set-piece opportunity when hooking over a right-footed volley. The visitors continued to look a threat on the counter-attack, with Mitoma and Mats Wieffer denied by Pope, yet this battling performance was in stark contrast to their usual free-flowing style. Hurzeler's refusal to adapt from his high-line defensive tactic brought some questions early in his tenure, but this victory – aided by the heroics of Verbruggen – may show the German can adapt ahead of Brighton's next task against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Bournemouth continued to look dangerous and found their reward when Justin Kluivert's penalty doubled the lead after 61 minutes before Antoine Semenyo slotted in a well-taken third just two minutes later. This win lifts high-flying Bournemouth - unbeaten in five matches - to fifth in the table and just three points adrift of the top four, while United's struggles leave them 13th. Noussair Mazraoui's ill-timed sliding challenge allowed Bournemouth to extend their lead, with Kluivert converting down the middle after winning the penalty just past the hour. Much to ponder for Amorim\\nA 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth at Old Trafford last season marked one of many low points under Erik ten Hag, and this loss by an identical scoreline against the same opponents shows just how much work Amorim has to do. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho were introduced before the hour and both had chances after the damage was already done; the former drew a smart Kepa stop after the latter had raced through and been denied by the Bournemouth goalkeeper. Free-flowing Bournemouth dreaming of Europe\\nBournemouth have travelled well in recent weeks, beating Wolves and Ipswich Town, yet this performance - similar to the corresponding fixture last season - was their most impressive. Andoni Iraola's side asserted their authority from the off, with Semenyo driving straight at Onana from range before Kluivert slipped when attempting a similar effort. United may have had complaints about Malacia's foul on Smith, but Bournemouth deservedly capitalised on a strong opening when Christie's floated free-kick delivery found the almighty leap of Huijsen. Semenyo blazed over immediately after the interval when Onana's positioning was questionable, though the Bournemouth man made no mistake from near the penalty spot to make it 3-0 after Kluivert's left-sided run brought the earlier spot-kick.

      "{'Man Utd': '.', 'Brentford': \"Rasmus Hojlund's first Premier League goal of the season helped to ease the pressure on manager Erik ten Hag as Manchester United claimed an important 2-1 victory over Brentford. United needed two stoppage-time goals to beat the Bees on their last visit to Old Trafford in October 2023, and their powers of recovery were required again on Saturday. Ethan Pinnock headed Brentford into the lead five minutes into first-half stoppage time, but two moments of individual class turned the game around in the second half. Brentford, meanwhile, are one point further back in 12th place. How the match unfolded\\nBrentford almost fell behind in bizarre fashion midway through the first half as Mark Flekken dropped a cross against Hojlund before scooping the ball off the line. Flekken was then worked at his near post by Fernandes, before Andre Onana went one better at the other end with a stunning save from Christian Norgaard's dipping strike. United were hit with a sucker punch on the stroke of half-time, Pinnock heading Mikkel Damsgaard's corner home after Matthijs de Ligt was forced off temporarily due to a head injury. United upped the ante from there, and the pressure paid off shortly after the hour mark as Hojlund latched onto Fernandes' backheel before coolly lobbing Flekken. With United's confidence growing, Flekken made a big save to deny Diogo Dalot, and there was to be no late twist as Ten Hag's men held on for a morale-boosting win. History repeats itself for United\\nLast October, United welcomed Brentford to Old Trafford following back-to-back defeats, for a match that felt potentially decisive for their under-fire boss Ten Hag. After a week in which Ten Hag accused members of the media of inventing 'lies and fairytales' about his reign, there was a sense of déjà vu on Saturday, with Brentford threatening to inflict another humiliation on his team before they rescued the points. Bees pegged back again\\nHaving scored in the second minute or earlier in four straight Premier League games before this one, Brentford left it late to hit the front by their standards, with Pinnock taking advantage of some static set-piece defending in first-half stoppage time. However, the contest had been flipped on its head within 17 minutes of the restart, with manager Thomas Frank, who has now lost 50 matches in the top flight, left to rue yet another lost lead. Brentford dropped a Premier League-high 30 points from winning positions in 2023/24, and no team has dropped more than their 11 already in 2024/25, having also let leads slip against Manchester City, Tottenham and West Ham. The Bees buzzed around United in the opening period, not giving the hosts' short-handed midfield a moment's peace and looking to feed Mbeumo whenever possible. However, Mbeumo was effectively contained by Dalot after the break, with Brentford's lengthy injury list limiting their attacking options. Yoane Wissa's return from the bench will certainly be a welcome sight for Frank, though, as his team look ahead to a fixture against Ipswich Town at the Gtech Community Stadium next week.

Having been buoyed by Chelsea’s earlier draw at Everton, Liverpool took full advantage of the Blues’ slip-up with a dominant display at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where Spurs did briefly offer hope of a fightback. Liverpool led 3-1 by the interval – Luis Diaz, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai on target, with James Maddison having scored for the hosts. Mohamed Salah helped himself to a deserved double early in the second half, and though Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke made matters interesting, Diaz made sure for Liverpool with a goal in the 85th minute.

How the match unfolded\\nAfter seeing a glut of chances fall by the wayside – including Salah hitting the woodwork – Liverpool deservedly went ahead in the 23rd minute when Trent Alexander-Arnold’s exquisite cross was headed home by Diaz. Liverpool added a second 13 minutes later – Mac Allister gambling on a loose ball to send a looping header over Fraser Forster – though the Argentinian was at fault when Maddison robbed him of possession and bent in a low finish. Yet Liverpool’s two-goal cushion was restored on the stroke of half-time when Salah slipped in Szoboszlai, who finished coolly, and the Egyptian turned from provider to scorer nine minutes after the restart as he tapped into a gaping net following a blistering counter-attack. Salah scored again just after the hour, slotting in from Szoboszlai’s neat pass, though Spurs rallied, first through Kulusevski’s excellent volley and then Solanke’s close-range prod. Liverpool had too much, though, and Diaz swiftly assured there would be no comeback for the ages. Rampant Reds get their Christmas wish\\nLiverpool will top the table on Christmas Day for the first time since the 2020/21 season, though it is worth noting that only once in the last seven top-flight campaigns in which they have sat at the summit on 25 December, have they gone on to win the title. The Reds were held to frustrating draws by Fulham and Newcastle United in their last two league outings, but when they are on top form in attack, they can be unstoppable, and at times on Sunday they were just that. They set the tone early when Salah pounced on Forster’s error, only to fire into the side netting. He then saw an attempt clatter the crossbar and two efforts blocked by Djed Spence, before Alexander-Arnold delivered a sensational cross from which Diaz could hardly miss. This Liverpool display was different to many that have come so far under Arne Slot, though. Salah was, as he has been all season, supreme – his two second-half finishes took him fourth on Liverpool’s all-time goalscorer list. Spurs’ second-choice goalkeeper denied Alexander-Arnold twice, first from a fantastic free-kick and then from a shot from a tight angle.

Bukayo Saka had given Arsenal a ninth-minute lead with his 50th Premier League strike and Mikel Merino's first Gunners goal had them in front by the break after Virgil van Dijk's equaliser.

The Seagulls took the lead as Wieffer opened his account for the club, though it was a bittersweet day for the midfielder, who limped off injured a few minutes later. But Brighton are without a clean sheet in eight league games, so West Ham will have always sensed an opportunity to hit back and did just that through Kudus. Brighton did, however, look the more likely to snatch all three points late on. Unmarked in the six-yard box to meet Minteh’s low cross, Mitoma somehow skewed his effort against the post from inside the box. Brighton return to the AMEX Stadium to face Brentford next Friday.

Casemiro had cancelled out Crysencio Summerville’s opener as the game burst into life late on, but Bowen's penalty in the second minute of second-half stoppage time - awarded for Matthijs de Ligt's foul on substitute Danny Ings - settled the contest. However, there was late drama as Bowen won it in the second of 12 added minutes in the second half, scoring from the spot after De Ligt had fouled Ings. Bowen’s cool penalty finish handed Julen Lopetegui's hosts a much-needed victory as West Ham leapfrog their opponents into 13th spot with 11 points, the same tally as the 14th-placed Red Devils. United were denied by the woodwork again on 40 minutes when Christian Eriksen’s corner was glanced onto the bar by Hammers midfielder Edson Alvarez, but it was West Ham who made the breakthrough in the second half. Substitute Ings miscued his shot from a Bowen cross, but Summerville arrived at the far post to tap the loose ball home. Their lead only lasted seven minutes as Casemiro headed home from almost on the goal line, but there was to be one final twist with Bowen stepping up to fire the match-winning penalty past goalkeeper Andre Onana. After an uninspiring draw against Jose Mourinho’s Fenerbahce in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday, their latest defeat at the London Stadium will do little to quell the rising doubts. United were by far the better team in the first half but passed up several gilt-edged chances, and unlike against Brentford last time out, they did not sharpen up after Ten Hag's half-time team talk, dropping deeper and inviting West Ham to fire crosses into their area. Lopetegui gets a reprieve\\nWhile the problems continue to mount for Ten Hag and Man Utd, Lopetegui will feel some pressure lifting after a rare win at home, where West Ham had only previously triumphed once in four matches this season. But without the suspended Mohammed Kudus, West Ham offered little going forward in the early stages, with a wayward Lucas Paqueta header in the 28th minute their only chance of note in the opening period. Lopetegui will hope to see more of the same from his players at Nottingham Forest next week, as the Hammers look to build some momentum after a poor start.

Forest’s winter wonderland\\nForest fans heading back to Nottingham will be feeling the festive cheer thanks to another smart tactical tweak from Nuno on the road. Williams teed up Aina for the opener and the latter's fine performance helped Elanga to offer another potent threat. With Aina offering the consistent width needed down Forest's right-hand side, Elanga was able to operate slightly infield – as Callum Hudson-Odoi did in tandem with Williams on the opposite flank – and the winger showed great determination, pace and skill to make the most of Keane-Potter’s error. It is turning into a season to remember for Forest, who are guaranteed to go into Christmas in the top four. Both full-backs were targeted in the build-up to Forest's goals, as Williams' dart in behind caught out Ajer, and Lewis-Potter’s mistake was punished by Elanga. Two players covering in slightly unfamiliar positions always brings risk, and they produced positive moments in attack, but a lack of confidence in a fresh role was thrust under the spotlight by a Forest side drilled to perfection.\"}\n",

Jacob Murphy, whose run had helped tee up the opener, powered in a second shortly after the half-hour mark, then Isak punished some sloppy play from Ipswich to make it 3-0 before the break. Murphy brilliantly assisted Isak for his hat-trick goal early in the second half, when Ipswich were arguably fortunate to avoid further punishment. Ipswich stay 18th, two points adrift of Leicester in 17th. Ipswich then presented Newcastle with an early Christmas gift on the stroke of half-time, as Bruno Guimaraes dispossessed Jens Cajuste inside the hosts' area to leave Isak with a simple finish. Watching the Magpies tear through Ipswich at will, it was remarkable to think they were being criticised for a lack of attacking thrust as recently as late November, when they failed to record a shot on target in a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace just five days after a tame 2-0 loss to West Ham. Isak got them off to a dream start here, sending his volley bouncing off the wet turf and beyond Arijanet Muric before the Ipswich goalkeeper could even blink.

Ipswich have now drawn four and lost five of their nine Premier League home matches this season. The Tractor Boys did threaten to make it a contest at 1-0 down, with Cajuste lashing over from the edge of the box before Sammie Szmodics snuck in behind a napping Newcastle backline, only to be denied by stand-in goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. While Newcastle's quality told for their second and fourth goals, their third will have disappointed McKenna. With just three minutes of first-half stoppage time to navigate, Muric was far too casual in attempting to play out to Cajuste and Ipswich were punished.

Coming off the back of three straight defeats, the pressure was on Oliver Glasner, and his team delivered the goods for their fans at Selhurst Park. Their winner came in the 31st minute when Mateta latched onto Eberechi Eze’s clever flick and drilled in from close range. While Brennan Johnson saw a shot hit a post for Spurs, Palace looked most likely to get the match\\'s second goal, and Eze saw one ruled out for offside before Adam Wharton was thwarted by Guglielmo Vicario. Palace were not made to pay for failing to add a second, however, as they claimed a morale-boosting result that takes them up to 17th, while Spurs are eighth after two defeats from their last three league matches. How the match unfolded\\nPalace went close when Will Hughes – an early substitute for Jefferson Lerma – exchanged a one-two with Wharton from a corner on the left and whipped in a cross, but Maxence Lacroix headed over. But Palace’s breakthrough arrived four minutes later as Daniel Munoz seized on an error from Micky van de Ven. The right-back’s delivery was flicked on by Eze, with Mateta able to take a touch and fire home. Eze appeared to have doubled Palace’s lead after running onto a ball over the top from Wharton and slotting home, but the goal was disallowed after VAR confirmed the on-field offside decision. Vicario brilliantly denied Ismaila Sarr and Wharton either side of Eze volleying over, though Spurs could not make their goalkeeper’s good work count at the other end. Eze gets Eagles soaring\\nEze was once more a driving force as Glasner’s team finally secured a much-needed victory. He was instrumental in Palace’s opener as he directed Munoz’s slightly wayward cross with a deft flick behind him to Mateta at the back post. The dynamism instilled by Eze in the Palace attack soon saw them emerge as the team on top for much of the second half. Just minutes later, the England international sparked claims of a penalty around Selhurst Park, going down under pressure from Van de Ven after a darting run. It has not been a flying start to the season for Eze or Palace, but they will hope this game represents a corner turned.

The Gunners are now back in third, three points behind leaders Liverpool and one shy of Chelsea, having played at least one game more than both, while Palace remain 15th. Arsenal, who wore black armbands in tribute to their former player George Eastham, who died at the age of 88, are back in third, three points behind leaders Liverpool and one shy of Chelsea, having played at least one game more than both, while Palace remain 15th.

Raya then had to drag Arsenal’s defence out of trouble when he denied Jean-Philippe Mateta a swift equaliser.

He made himself big to close down Mateta when Arsenal led 2-1, before producing two brilliant saves to frustrate Sarr after the break.

That strong form was on show from Oliver Glasner’s team during the first half, when they were arguably the better side in terms of creating clear-cut opportunities. VAR may have been called into action had Mateta put away his one-on-one with Raya just after Jesus had put Arsenal back ahead, but Palace’s centre-forward should have done better regardless, even if the visiting goalkeeper did well. But once Martinelli put Arsenal three goals to the good, Palace struggled to assert themselves again in the match. Eberechi Eze, out with a knock, watched on from the stands, as well as his former team-mates Wilfried Zaha and Michael Olise, and Glasner will want his talisman back to action swiftly, as Palace look to make amends for this result when they head to Bournemouth on Boxing Day.

They started brightly, with Mitoma going close, but with Henderson in inspired form for Palace between the posts, the Seagulls were opened up defensively at the other end.

Palmer, who had an early strike disallowed for offside, was integral to both of Chelsea’s goals on Sunday, playing a stunning pass in the build-up to Nicolas Jackson’s 18th-minute opener. Alexander Isak drew the visitors level with his first goal since returning from a toe injury, tucking home a cross from former Chelsea player Lewis Hall. But Palmer got his name on the scoresheet early in the second half, with his effort squeezing in at Nick Pope’s near post and Newcastle were unable to find a response. Chelsea’s triumph moves them five points ahead of 12th-placed Newcastle. How the match unfolded\\nThe Blues thought they had made an ideal start when Palmer was slipped through by Jackson before he finished past Pope, only for the goal to be overturned for offside after a VAR review. But Palmer played a key role in the opener, sweeping an inch-perfect long-range pass into the path of Pedro Neto, who squared for Jackson to tap home. Yet Palmer restored Chelsea’s advantage 75 seconds after the restart, firing the ball in low from a cute angle, before Neto then struck a post with a header soon after. Chelsea seemed set to have the chance to seal the result with a third when Christopher Nkunku was hauled down by Dan Burn in the box late on, but the on-field decision of a penalty was overturned after another VAR review. And leading up to the Magpies’ equaliser, it was Almiron who looked most likely to threaten Robert Sanchez’s goal, curling an effort narrowly wide of the far post before forcing the Chelsea goalkeeper into a save five minutes before Isak struck. Isak was twice denied when his header was blocked by Reece James, before rounding Sanchez, only to see the retreating Moises Caicedo make a timely interception. James passes Maresca test\\nAhead of kick-off, Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca expressed that he “wanted more” from captain James, who is only just back from injury, and he responded positively to his manager’s criticism despite a slow start on Sunday. James, operating on the opposite flank at left-back, was arguably at fault for Isak’s leveller after the Newcastle striker ghosted in front of him. But James bounced back well, producing several key interceptions after the break, including denying Isak by blocking his goal-bound effort and setting his side up on a counter-attack that almost led to a goal at the other end. Chelsea could have been out of site when Mykhailo Mudryk was set up by Palmer, but he could only find the hands of Pope, though with Newcastle pushing for an equaliser, James came to the Blues’ rescue to brilliantly head over Joe Willock’s cross in the dying stages.

Chris Wood saw a potential leveller disallowed for offside following a VAR review, but Forest continued to push for an equaliser and drew level courtesy of a powerful Nikola Milenkovic header in the 87th minute. Substitute Elanga then completed the turnaround four minutes into stoppage time, side-footing home to ensure Forest climbed above Manchester City with 28 points, and three ahead of Villa. How the match unfolded\\nNeither side carved out a chance of note in the first half-hour, with Forest centre-back Murillo the first to go close when he planted a header wide from Elliot Anderson's corner. Forest went agonisingly close to opening the scoring after 60 minutes, but Emiliano Martinez sensationally clawed Nicolas Dominguez's stooping header off the goal line. Forest thought they had levelled with eight minutes remaining as Wood slid Elanga's cross home, but a VAR review established the latter had been offside after being slipped in behind by Morgan Gibbs-White, overturning Samuel Barrott's on-field decision to award the goal. Nuno Espirito Santo's team would not be denied, though, with Martinez powerless to stop Milenkovic's thumping header from creeping over the line. Villa were then left shellshocked in stoppage time, with Anderson getting to the byline before finding Elanga, who sparked wild celebrations with a calm finish into the net. Forest dig deep for statement win\\nForest have managed to make the City Ground a fortress lately, winning three of their last four home Premier League matches ahead of Villa's visit. Having seen their team emerge as surprise contenders for a European place, the home fans were hoping to see a statement performance – Forest had lost each of their last six Premier League matches when starting the day inside the division's top five places. However, Nuno will argue his team made their own luck by producing a fighting performance. Refusing to let their heads drop after Wood saw a potential equaliser chalked off, Forest laid siege to the Villa area and always looked the more likely victors as the game entered stoppage time. Forest could be displaced from the top four when Manchester City face Manchester United on Sunday, but something special is in the air on the banks of the River Trent.

Duran scored with a stunning, long-range effort after coming off the bench to replace Watkins at half-time as Villa beat RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Tuesday. Duran has now scored on all five of his starts for Villa in all competitions this season and will be confident of keeping his place in the starting XI when Pep Guardiola’s side visit Villa Park next Saturday.

Fulham went ahead after 11 minutes as Raul Jimenez marked his return to the starting XI with a smart drilled finish to round off a swift counter-attack. Bukayo Saka seemed to have nodded home a winner in the 88th minute of Sunday’s contest at Craven Cottage, but the goal was overturned following a VAR review, with Gabriel Martinelli having strayed offside before he delivered the cross. How the match unfolded\\nAfter withstanding a series of Arsenal set-pieces, Fulham snatched the lead when Kenny Tete\\'s well-timed throug-hball released Jimenez, who arrowed a low shot beyond David Raya and into the left-hand corner. Saka called Bernd Leno into action from a tight angle, while Declan Rice was inches away from connecting with an inviting cross soon after. Saka thought he had broken Fulham’s resolve when he dived in to turn home Martinelli’s cross, but Arsenal’s celebrations were cut short. Stubborn Fulham thwart Gunners once more\\nFulham were looking to beat Arsenal in successive league matches for the first time in their history. It came following a patient, brave build-up play, too, with Adama Traore the only Fulham player not to touch the ball before Jimenez drilled in his fifth league goal of the season. Marco Silva’s side generally maintained their discipline as Arsenal sought a response, though their defence was unlocked by the league’s set-piece specialists early in the second half. Even so, apart from the momentary lapse for Saka’s late header, Fulham remained stubborn to ensure they took a well-earned point from this London derby. Silva will now want to see the same resolve from his players when they visit Liverpool next Saturday as Fulham look to stay firmly in the race for a top-six spot. The Gunners quickly got on top and asked questions of the Fulham defence from set-pieces, an area Mikel Arteta has said he wants them to be “masters” in. However, a brief lapse in concentration proved costly for Arsenal and was ruthlessly pounced upon by Fulham, who took the lead after a swift counter.

But West Ham hit the front nine minutes into the second half, with Soucek left unmarked at the back post as he headed Bowen's corner over Johnstone and the covering Gomes on the line. Kudus was found to be marginally offside following a VAR review when turning in Bowen's cross for what West Ham thought was a second, and Wolves made the most of that reprieve as Doherty sent a low volley past Lukasz Fabianski from 12 yards. West Ham's response was rapid, though, as Bowen turned Goncalo Guedes with ease and curled the ball into the bottom-left corner for what proved to be the winner. Perfect tribute to Antonio\\nWest Ham were rocked on Saturday by the news that the club's all-time record Premier League goalscorer Michail Antonio was involved in a road traffic accident, after which he underwent surgery on a lower limb fracture. Bowen then celebrated what proved to be the winning goal by holding Antonio's shirt up high at pitchside. This was another captain's performance from Bowen, who assisted Soucek's opener and brilliantly found the net to earn his side – and head coach Lopetegui – a much-needed win. With AFC Bournemouth and Brighton & Hove Albion up next before Christmas, the Hammers will now hope to finally build some positive momentum under the Spaniard.

Chelsea thumped nine-man Spurs 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last season but required an almighty fightback as Marc Cucurella\\'s errors gifted the hosts an early 2-0 lead at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Palmer levelled just past the hour mark with his first penalty, and after Enzo Fernandez had blasted the Blues ahead, Palmer won another spot-kick, which he coolly dinked beyond Fraser Forster. Palmer now becomes the highest-scoring penalty taker in Premier League history with a 100 per cent conversation rate. Son Heung-min’s stoppage-time strike teed up a nervy ending for Chelsea, but they held firm to move two points clear of Arsenal in second and make ground on Liverpool, while Spurs sit 11th after a second defeat in the space of three days. Sancho halved the deficit when darting inside and drilling home via the help of the right-hand post, and the Chelsea comeback began. Yves Bissouma\\'s challenge on Moises Caicedo saw Palmer level from 12 yards in the 61st minute, and Fernandez then hammered past the helpless Forster to put Chelsea ahead.

Chelsea carnage turns into celebration\\nEnzo Maresca\\'s possession-based philosophy has been clear throughout the early parts of his Chelsea tenure and has proved successful – but an error-laden first half showed the risks to the strategy. Cucurella somewhat made amends as his simple pass teed up a sumptuous finish by Sancho, who then laid it on a plate for Palmer – only for Chelsea\\'s talisman to fluff a gilt-edged chance to equalise – while Caicedo was perhaps fortunate to escape punishment when he lunged in on Sarr, though the VAR confirmed the referee’s call of no serious four play. Palmer almost atoned for that glaring miss but his rasping drive was pushed away by Forster, who denied Pedro Neto\\'s follow-up attempt, before the Spurs goalkeeper produced an impressive stretching stop to deny Sancho in the second half. But Chelsea eventually roared into the ascendancy thanks to the brilliance of ice-cold Palmer after the break, and Spurs’ defence could not cope once the Blues hit their stride.

The chances flowed at both ends in the second half, but it was Brentford who seized their opportunity to rack up another three points. Thomas Frank's team remain unbeaten on home soil this season and now sit seventh in the table, while Newcastle remain 12th and are without a victory in four league games. Mbeumo got the ball rolling for the hosts after eight minutes, stepping inside Lewis Hall to fire home, before Isak stooped to nod Newcastle level three minutes later. That set the tone for an engaging battle, with Isak denied by a sprawling Mark Flekken, before Wissa pounced on a loose pass from Barnes to fire the Bees back in front after 28 minutes. However, Brentford's lead lasted just four minutes this time, as more static defending allowed Barnes to make it 2-2, before Jacob Murphy frustratingly headed over with the goal gaping. Brentford settled quicker after the restart, with Nick Pope diverting Wissa's strike onto the post before Collins stole in behind Newcastle's defence to steer home after 56 minutes. Home is where the heart is\\nOne of the quirks of Brentford's season so far has been the wild contrast between their home and away form in the Premier League. This win against Newcastle brings the Bees up to 22 home points gained so far in 2024/25 - more than any other top-flight side - with seven wins and one draw from eight matches at the Gtech Community Stadium. However, given the congested nature of this Premier League campaign, the Bees' outstanding form on home soil could be enough to have them dreaming of a push for Europe. No Brentford player enjoys his outings at the Gtech more than Wissa. Nottingham Forest will become the final team to visit the Gtech in the Premier League this calendar year on 21 December, after Frank's men go to Chelsea for a west London Derby next Sunday. His first-half goal came between two wasted openings and his defensive work fell glaringly short in the build-up to Wissa's goal, the Brentford man taking in his slack pass before advancing into the area and rifling home.

After Jota Silva and Bruno Fernandes were denied by the woodwork at either end, Morgan Gibbs-White put Forest ahead again two minutes after the restart with a shot that too easily beat Andre Onana before Chris Wood’s header doubled the visiting side’s advantage. It was Wood's 25th top-flight goal for Forest, making the New Zealander his club's leading Premier League goalscorer ahead of Bryan Roy. With the hard-fought victory, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side climb to fifth with 25 points from 15 matches while United are 13th with 19 points, their lowest position after 15 league matches since 1986/87. How the match unfolded\\nForest came out fast, taking the lead just 91 seconds after kick-off as Milenkovic won his battle with Lisandro Martinez to head home an Elliot Anderson corner. Forest began the second half like they did the first, as Gibbs-White’s low drive from the edge of the box wrongfooted Andre Onana, possibly with the help of Storm Darragh. Wood’s looping header from a Gibbs-White cross then made it 3-1 with fewer than 10 minutes played in the second period. Fernandes gave United hopes of a comeback when he beat Sels from outside the box following a cutback from Amad, but the Forest defence held firm to take home all three points. Onana’s error allowed the visitors to pull ahead again and their defending for Forest’s eventual winner also left a lot to be desired. Wood stars for Forest again\\nForest were beaten fair and square by Manchester City on Wednesday, but Espirito Santo will be happy to return home with three points in the bag after a double-header in Manchester. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anderson returned to the starting line-up and bagged assists as Forest made quick starts to both the halves. Forest captain Ryan Yates put in an excellent shift as he stuck to Fernandes whenever his United counterpart was in possession, but it was Wood who proved to be the matchwinner. Having just aimed to avoid relegation during the last two campaigns, things are looking up for Forest this time around and they trail fourth-placed City by just two points.

      "{'Fulham': 'Alex Iwobi was the star of the show as his brace helped Fulham to a 3-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on Thursday. Iwobi capitalised on Bart Verbruggen\\'s early error in the fourth minute to get the home side off to a flying start at Craven Cottage. Carlos Baleba finished expertly after neat work from Joao Pedro to bring Brighton level in the 56th minute, but Matt O\\'Riley\\'s own goal restored Fulham\\'s lead. And Iwobi wrapped up the points with a lovely bending effort in the closing stages to settle an entertaining contest. Victory lifts Fulham into sixth, just a point and a place behind Brighton in a congested top half of the Premier League. How the match unfolded\\nIwobi pounced on Verbruggen\\'s sloppy pass inside the penalty area to side-foot casually home after only four minutes. Bernd Leno kept out Joao Pedro at the other end after he got in behind Calvin Bassey and Simon Adingra will feel he should have done better when shooting straight at the goalkeeper from Kaoru Mitoma\\'s excellent low centre. Rodrigo Muniz headed agonisingly wide from Antonee Robinson\\'s clipped cross on the stroke of half-time and Harry Wilson almost caught Brighton cold immediately from kick-off. Yet Fulham retook the lead on 79 minutes when Andreas Pereira\\'s in-swinging corner deflected into the bottom-right corner off the unfortunate O\\'Riley. Iwobi then had the final say, showing neat footwork to create space in the left-hand side of the area before brilliantly curling a low strike into the far corner. Iwobi finds a way for Fulham\\nThere might be 20 days until Christmas but Fulham were handed an early festive gift from Verbruggen that the excellent Iwobi was all too happy to receive. In truth, the early goal was at odds with a first half in which the visitors were the more forward-thinking team and Marco Silva was grateful to his goalkeeper for thwarting Adingra after 34 minutes. Fulham always carried a goal threat, though, and Muniz ought to have done better when leaping high to meet Robinson\\'s fantastic cross from the left shortly before the break. However, there was a sense of inevitability about the equaliser, albeit it was a move right out of the very top drawer that broke Fulham\\'s resistance. But in credit to the hosts they reset themselves well and, after a bit of fortune for their second, there was no luck involved for Iwobi\\'s magical effort late on, which put the match well beyond the reach of Brighton. In an encounter that was so closely fought, the ex-Everton and Arsenal star – who will go up against the Gunners in Fulham’s next outing – found a way to be a difference maker for his side. Van Hecke\\'s arrowed pass was expertly cushioned down by Joao Pedro but Baleba still had plenty to do as he cut across the ball and beyond Leno, who was at full stretch. What will not have thrilled Brighton’s boss is the way his team failed to build on the momentum thereafter, even if it was unlucky that O\\'Riley got the final touch from that Fulham corner. And when Iwobi\\'s brilliant third went in, you feel Hurzeler will have been scratching his head at just how this match got away from Brighton – who have still yet to beat Fulham in nine Premier League meetings.

Head-scratcher for Hurzeler\\nFabian Hurzeler will have been frustrated by Brighton\\'s early blunder but, given he does like to encourage his team to play from the back, will probably forgive his goalkeeper’s mistake. Indeed, it will likely have irritated the Brighton head coach more that despite some fantastic patterns of play, his side struggled to make the most of the opportunities they carved out in an opening 45 minutes full of enterprise but lacking in conviction.

      "{'Bournemouth': 'Bournemouth moved into the top half of the Premier League with a 1-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur at the Vitality Stadium. Dean Huijsen scored the decisive goal in the 17th minute when the Spurs defence allowed the 19-year-old defender to head in unmarked from a Marcus Tavernier corner. Bournemouth leapfrogged their opponents into ninth place on 21 points, while Spurs dropped to 10th, one point behind the Cherries. How the match unfolded\\nDominic Solanke had an early opportunity to hurt his former club as he capitalised on a mistake from Huijsen, only for the youngster to recover with a timely block. Solanke’s Bournemouth replacement Evanilson had an even better chance when his close-range effort was parried behind by Fraser Forster for a corner. Yet the hosts went ahead from the resultant set-piece, with Huijsen planting home a header to become Bournemouth’s youngest Premier League goalscorer. Tavernier almost turned from provider to scorer just after the half-hour, but saw a goal ruled out for offside before Forster kept out a close-range header from the midfielder on the cusp of half-time. Evanilson thought he had doubled Bournemouth’s lead when he tucked into an open goal after Tyler Adams capitalised on a blunder from Forster, but the former Porto striker was ahead of the play. Despite that, the Spanish goalkeeper had a much more comfortable evening in the Bournemouth goal than his Spurs counterpart as the visiting side failed to bypass a well-organised home defence. Huijsen headlines vibrant Bournemouth display\\nIt was another hugely impressive display from Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth, who came into the game high on confidence following a 4-2 thrashing of Wolves in their last game. After a shaky start when he allowed Solanke in with a chance, the Spain Under-21 international, making only his third start of the season, dealt with everything thrown at him by Spurs. Meanwhile, in attack, Kluivert, the hat-trick hero from the Wolves win, looked dangerous while the lively Christie, Tavernier and Evanilson had chances to double the Cherries lead – as did substitute Dango Ouattara, who fired over in the 83rd minute. Huijsen, though, will rightly take the headlines, as Bournemouth added Spurs to their list of big Premier League scalps this season, having already claimed home wins over Arsenal and Man City.

Having been beaten 4-0 by Manchester United on Sunday, Everton responded in force at Goodison Park by the same scoreline against a team also battling at the wrong end of the table. Orel Mangala then doubled Everton’s advantage with a stinging, deflected shot, after the hosts had also had a goal disallowed. Everton’s set-piece proficiency continued in the second half – Craig Dawson twice turned into his own net as he challenged Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Sean Dyche's side claimed a morale-boosting win that takes them 15th, five points clear of the bottom three, with Wolves in 19th. How the match unfolded\\nEverton were off the mark after 10 minutes when Young curled a low free-kick around the Wolves wall and in at Jose Sa’s near post. The Toffees exposed Wolves’ set-piece fragility again as Dwight McNeil swung a cross in for James Tarkowski to head home. Jordan Pickford denied Wolves an equaliser when Jorgen Strand Larsen outmuscled Tarkowski, while the visiting forward also glanced wide from a cross, but Gary O’Neil’s team were left to rue those misses in the 33rd minute when Mangala stormed onto a loose ball and hammered in a strike that deflected beyond Sa. Everton had their third four minutes after half-time, Dawson netting the first of his two own goals as he battled with Calvert-Lewin from McNeil’s corner. But Everton added further gloss when Dawson diverted in as he lunged to block Calvert-Lewin’s stooping header. Everton's dead-ball prowess\\nAll four of the hosts’ goals started with a dead-ball scenario, and this is a weapon Dyche has relied on during his time at Goodison. That threat has been nullified in recent weeks, with the Toffees having not scored in four games heading into Wednesday’s contest, but they sharpened up against a Wolves defence that simply could not handle Everton’s physicality in the box. Yet it was McNeil’s crosses that caused the visitors the most consternation. The hosts’ second should have been warning enough as Wolves failed to clear from McNeil’s delivery out on the right, which allowed Mangala the space and time to unleash a stinging shot from the edge of the box. That came after Tarkowski had been given a free header from close range too, with that goal disallowed. Everton’s next two goals benefited more directly from McNeil’s deliveries. First, he sent a great ball to the back post, and while Calvert-Lewin didn’t get the final touch, such was the placement, Dawson could only nudge it in. It was another superb delivery from the right by McNeil that allowed Calvert-Lewin a slight touch at the near post before Dawson’s attempted block flew into the bottom corner and past Sa, as Everton returned to scoring form in style ahead of facing local rivals Liverpool on Saturday. Calvert-Lewin was nearly gifted a goal as miscommunication between Sa and Dawson forced the latter to make a hasty clearance. Sa was left raging at his ineffective wall for Young’s opener before the visitors twice allowed Tarkowski to rise uncontested in the box to head goalwards. Dawson’s misfortune epitomised the malaise of the Wolves defence as, after conceding an own goal, he repeated the earlier mistake to send a slow backpass dangerously close to the pursuing Calvert-Lewin, leaving Sa to sweep up.

      "{'Newcastle': '.', 'Liverpool': \"Fabian Schar scored a 90th-minute equaliser as Newcastle United salvaged a 3-3 draw against Premier League leaders Liverpool in an absorbing contest at St James' Park. Liverpool were on course for a fifth straight league win when Mohamed Salah turned a thrilling match on its head with a second-half double. The outstanding Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon had earlier scored for Eddie Howe's much-improved Magpies, either side of Curtis Jones sweeping home on his 150th Liverpool appearance. While Newcastle are 10th, Liverpool's lead at the summit now stands at seven points, with Chelsea and Arsenal both gaining ground after their respective wins against Southampton and Manchester United. How the match unfolded\\nBoth sides struck the woodwork during a lively opening, Alexis Mac Allister hitting the base of the post before Jacob Murphy did the same at the other end. It was the hosts who took the lead after 35 minutes, Isak holding off Virgil van Dijk before crashing a wonderful effort into the top-right corner from outside the area. Kelleher then denied Gordon with a one-on-one save, and the Reds drew level five minutes into the second half as Jones brilliantly swept Salah's cutback into the roof of the net. Newcastle inched ahead once again in the 62nd minute – Gordon cutting past Joe Gomez to fire home after linking up with Isak – but that lead was short-lived as Liverpool substitute Trent Alexander-Arnold found Salah for a simple finish. Salah thought he had won it for Liverpool when he tucked home brilliantly on the turn, but there was to be a final twist. Taking in Guimaraes' pass between the Liverpool lines, Isak showed tremendous strength and awareness to hold off Van Dijk before getting the ball out of his feet and lashing home the opener. It was his well-placed through-ball that allowed Murphy in to rattle a post, and he could also have had an assist when sliding a pass between Van Dijk's legs to find Lewis Hall, only for a fine recovery challenge from Gomez to save Liverpool. However, Howe will know an improvement is needed at the back after they were cut apart by Salah and company after the interval. Salah exploits not enough for victory\\nLiverpool's 2-0 victory over Manchester City last Sunday was soon overshadowed by talk regarding Salah's future at the club. However, that speculation has certainly not distracted Salah from his game. He supplied a pinpoint cutback for Jones to crash home when Liverpool were on the back foot at 1-0 down, and was later in the right place at the right time to convert two Alexander-Arnold crosses, the England international making a fine impact after coming on as a 68th-minute substitute. Salah has now registered both a goal and an assist in 37 different Premier League matches, more than any other player in the competition's history. Arne Slot will be bitterly disappointed that Salah's exploits were not enough to hand Liverpool three points, with a momentary lapse from Kelleher giving Schar an empty net to tuck into in the final minute of the 90. But Newcastle tend to provide a sterner test than most, particularly on home soil, and if Salah can continue his incredible form, the Reds – who face city rivals Everton on Saturday – will be difficult to catch.

With Arsenal and Manchester City losing, Liverpool are top of the pile on 25 points, two clear of their nearest challengers after the opening 10 games, while Brighton are seventh. Liverpool’s search for an equaliser was met with a flurry of saves from Verbruggen, who denied Alexis Mac Allister a goal against his former club, with Brighton having earlier gone close through Georginio Rutter and Danny Welbeck. But two goals in just 128 seconds turned the match on its head, with Gakpo’s attempted cross going all the way through to draw the Reds level. Salah then powered Arne Slot’s side in front, capping off a sweeping move as Liverpool turned defence into attack. Curtis Jones supplied the pass out to the Egyptian, who set himself on his stronger foot and bent a sublime effort into the left-hand corner to delight the Anfield faithful and send the Reds top. Slot’s comeback kings\\nLiverpool made a name of being the comeback kings under Jurgen Klopp, but their inspired second-half turnaround proved Slot has mastered those powers of recovery too. Mac Allister’s header, that was saved by Verbruggen, was a sign of their intent, with Virgil van Dijk squandering a golden chance moments later after being picked out by Trent Alexander-Arnold’s delivery – the Dutchman unable to find the desired connection. Luis Diaz’s introduction provided the spark that was missing in the final third, and his impact helped pave the way for Gakpo and Salah to take centre stage.

      "{'Man City': 'Manchester City won for the first time in eight matches across all competitions, as they produced an assured 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola’s side came into the game having lost four Premier League matches on the bounce and they were on a seven-match winless run in all competitions. But goals from Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne and Jeremy Doku earned the champions a much-needed victory. De Bruyne assisted Silva’s early close-range opener before doubling City’s lead just after the half-hour mark, giving Matz Sels no chance with his powerful strike. Doku rounded off a confidence-boosting display for the hosts in the 57th minute, finishing off a brilliant counter-attack with a fine curling shot as City earned their first win since 26 October. City’s victory moved them back into the top four and reduced their gap behind leaders Liverpool to nine points, while a third loss in four games leaves Forest on 22 points. How the match unfolded\\nIt took just eight minutes for City to break the deadlock and settle the home fans’ nerves, as De Bruyne rose high to nod towards the goal line where Silva stretched out a leg to poke it in. De Bruyne was in the thick of the action, with his sloppy pass almost gifting an equaliser to Chris Wood, who missed from a one-v-one situation, shortly before the Belgian rifled City’s second goal past Sels. City made sure of victory when they exploited the space in behind as Forest committed bodies forward, with Erling Haaland sliding in Doku, who cut inside to bend a wonderful strike into the bottom-right corner. De Bruyne also fizzed a low free-kick around the wall and just wide of the near post, while Anthony Elanga’s attempt for a consolation floated narrowly over Ortega’s crossbar as City held on comfortably. De Bruyne provides the spark\\nGuardiola has rung the changes without reward over recent weeks as he tried to turn City’s fortunes around. It seems De Bruyne was the missing piece to their puzzle after his influential display ensured they returned to winning ways. The midfielder – making his first Premier League start in nearly three months – orchestrated the hosts from the start, setting up Haaland for an early chance that Sels parried before De Bruyne set up the opener. Even after Wood pounced on his mistake, De Bruyne’s confidence did not waver, showcased by his fine finish in the 31st minute. City were also boosted by the strong displays from Doku and Jack Grealish on their returns to the starting line-up, with the former causing havoc down the left. Despite holding a big lead, Guardiola will not have felt secure until the final whistle was blown given City’s recent collapse in their 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the UEFA Champions League, but this time his team were able to hold out for a much-needed three points without any undue stress. Disjointed Forest undone\\nForest may have hoped it was an ideal time to face City given the hosts’ recent poor form, though on reflection it could have been the worst time to play them, as Guardiola had his refreshed team fired up after their uncharacteristic run of defeats. Gibbs-White and Wood both had brilliant chances to equalise before De Bruyne’s goal, and the away fans were astounded when the latter dragged his chance wide of the far post under little pressure given his recent hot streak in front of goal. However, that was their downfall, as City were able to exploit the space in behind and ruthlessly wrap up the win with a third goal.

Josko Gvardiol had two glorious chances to add to their tally, glancing a free header wide before dragging a shot past the post either side of an impressive Stefan Ortega save which denied Morgan Gibbs-White at the other end. City made sure of victory when they exploited the space in behind as Forest committed bodies forward, with Erling Haaland sliding in Doku, who cut inside to bend a wonderful strike into the bottom-right corner.

They went in front early on through Axel Disasi’s header but were quickly pegged back as Joe Aribo fired home an equaliser for the home side. A miserable night for Southampton was made more difficult when Jack Stephens was shown a red card by the referee in the first half following a VAR review, after an entanglement with Marc Cucurella. The result sees Chelsea move up to second, while Southampton remain at the foot of the table. How the match unfolded\\nThe home side had a glorious chance within the first two minutes of the match, but Filip Jorgensen made a fantastic save to deny Aribo from close range. But the Saints weren’t behind for long, as Aribo made up for his earlier miss with an easy finish after Kyle Walker-Peters supplied a neat cut back from the left. It got even worse for the hosts before half-time, with the referee giving Stephens a red card for violent conduct following a VAR review after the Saints captain had pulled Cucurella's hair. Sorry Saints continue poor run at foot of the table\\nDespite their position in the table, Russell Martin would have been encouraged by recent performances against Liverpool and Brighton, in which his side had been competitive and perhaps deserved more than their solitary point. But, apart from a frenetic opening in which Aribo scored and missed a wonderful opportunity, they were second-best. Defensive errors, regrettably a trademark of Martin’s side this season, were on full display again. The Saints were cut open on far too many occasions, predominantly in the first half, and they are now already in serious danger of being cut adrift in the fight to stave off relegation, seven points from safety with 14 matches played.

Rogers, Ollie Watkins and Matty Cash were all on target in a 13-minute flurry of goals in the first half that proved decisive at Villa Park on Wednesday. An impressive victory saw Unai Emery’s side end their alarming recent run of form, which had included collecting just two points from their last five Premier League games. A long-range strike from Rogers midway through the first half broke the deadlock, and Watkins swiftly doubled the lead with a penalty kick he had won himself. How the match unfolded\\nVilla took the lead in spectacular fashion in the 21st minute, as Rogers exchanged passes with Watkins before whipping a delicious 20-yard effort into the top corner. The hosts doubled their advantage seven minutes later when Watkins, who was fouled by Ethan Pinnock, just about beat Mark Flekken from 12 yards, despite the Brentford goalkeeper getting a hand to his spot-kick. It was three in the 34th minute when Rogers’ cross to the far post evaded Watkins but was volleyed in from a tight angle by Cash. Flekken denied Lucas Digne and Watkins shortly after the break before Brentford pulled one back in the 54th minute, as Damsgaard fired into the roof of the net from close range. However, it was Villa who went closest to scoring next. Watkins and substitute Jhon Duran both called Flekken into action in the closing stages, while the returning Tyrone Mings headed just over from a corner. Villa’s drought is over\\nHeading into this showdown without a win in eight matches across all competitions, Villa’s confidence had taken a knock in recent times. Emery’s side have been unable to build on their early season momentum, but they received two timely boosts ahead of this game, with Emiliano Martinez fit between the sticks despite sustaining a hairline fracture in his hand that forced him off at half- time against Chelsea on Sunday. At the other end of the pitch, Villa’s dangerous counter-attacks were crucial for two of their goals. Those two strikes sandwiched Watkins’ fifth strike in as many matches against his former club. That is the joint-worst road record in the league along with bottom-of-the-table Southampton, and it was another poor display on their travels here, meaning they have now failed to win in all 10 of their league trips to Villa Park. However, it proved a false dawn with Villa’s clinical display in front of goal effectively ending the match as a contest after 34 minutes.

The hosts return to the Premier League’s top half in seventh place on 22 points – two more than Thomas Frank’s side, who slip to ninth.

Watkins and substitute Jhon Duran both called Flekken into action in the closing stages, while the returning Tyrone Mings headed just over from a corner. Nevertheless, the two-goal buffer was enough to get a much-needed win on the board, condemning the Bees to a first defeat in four. Brentford continue to struggle on their travels\\nThough unbeaten in three matches and on a high after thumping Leicester City last time out, Brentford had only collected one of their 20 points this season away from home. Flekken came to their rescue with some smart saves to prevent the defeat from being even heavier, and although they did pull a goal back through Damsgaard’s well-taken effort, a comeback never looked likely. The Bees struggled to build any momentum off the back of their goal early in the second half, and continued struggles on the road are a cause for concern. Fortunately for Frank, two of their next three league games are on home soil and his side remain well placed in the top half.

While they tightened up defensively, Villa struggled to generate a consistent attacking threat at the other end to get themselves back into the contest.

      "{'Man Utd': '.', 'Everton': 'Ruben Amorim claimed his first Premier League win in charge of Manchester United with a 4-0 victory over Everton on Sunday. Following the result, United move up to ninth on 19 points, while Everton remain in 15th, two points above the relegation zone. Later in the first half, Rashford met Bruno Fernandes’ corner on the volley, and Jarrad Branthwaite deflected it into the net. It took just 20 seconds for the hosts to add a third after the restart, Amad coolly threading it through for Rashford, who beat Jordan Pickford at his near post with a powerful low shot. As Everton pushed bodies forward in search of a goal, they were caught out by a blistering counter-attack, with Amad dispossessing James Tarkowski to tee up Zirkzee for his second. Dominic Calvert-Lewin almost grabbed a late consolation for Everton, but Onana pushed his header away from the near post. In their new 3-4-3 formation, the hosts initially struggled against Everton, who looked comfortable in midfield thanks to Dwight McNeil’s composure. Everton left with questions to answer\\nEverton’s defensive record in recent games has been something to admire, but Sean Dyche was left with more questions at both ends of the pitch as his side drew another blank. It has been four matches and over a month since the Toffees last celebrated a goal, a dilemma which the manager attempted to address by starting Beto ahead of Calvert-Lewin, a move that looked like it might pay off. McNeil breezed through United’s midfield in the opening exchanges and picked up promising positions, but with no end product in sight, they could not make the danger count. Calvert-Lewin was introduced with 25 minutes left, albeit with Everton already 4-0 down, and only a brilliant save from Onana kept him off the scoresheet. Perhaps more worrying to Dyche will be the ease with which United picked them apart for the four goals, with defensive errors leading to two of those after their recent solidity at the back, something he will be hoping is simply a blip.

But Fulham dragged themselves level through substitute Cairney, who curled a stunning left-footed effort beyond the grasp of Fraser Forster 13 minutes later, five minutes after coming off the bench. The draw means Spurs are seventh in the table, with 20 points from 13 matches, while Fulham are a point back in 10th. How the match unfolded\\nFulham almost found themselves behind inside a minute when Calvin Bassey’s loose pass was gathered by Werner, but Bernd Leno was on hand to thwart Son Heung-min from close range. Forster was then needed at the other end to smother at the feet of Raul Jimenez after he was picked out brilliantly by Alex Iwobi, before both sides struck the woodwork at the end of the first half. Iwobi gathered the ball after a counter-attack but his strike rattled the crossbar, while James Maddison’s clever free-kick under the wall clipped a post in first-half stoppage time. Despite not being at their best, Spurs took the lead through Johnson, who finished confidently beyond Leno inside the box, only to see their lead wiped out through substitute Cairney’s well-taken effort. But the Fulham captain was given his marching orders seven minutes from time for a poor challenge on Kulusevski. Without Dominic Solanke after the England international fell ill before kick-off, Son led the line and had two fantastic opportunities to open the scoring but was denied twice by Leno, before the visiting goalkeeper tipped Radu Dragusin’s header over the crossbar. Spurs could have fallen behind in second-half stoppage time had it not been for Dragusin’s timely interception from Harry Wilson’s cross. Fulham deserve their point\\xa0\\nFulham bounced back from their disappointing defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers last time out with an impressive away display that perhaps warranted more than a point. While Spurs dominated the possession in the opening exchanges, it was Fulham who created the better chances, with Jimenez heading Sasa Lukic’s corner narrowly wide before the Mexican’s heavy touch in the box allowed Forster the opportunity to save. The visitors continued to threaten throughout the first half, with Kenny Tete’s inviting delivery finding Jimenez, who saw his effort brilliantly saved by Forster once again, shortly followed by Iwobi’s crisp strike that cannoned off the crossbar to close out the first 45 minutes. Fulham continued to frustrate their opponents after the break but were unable to find the telling touch as Issa Diop, Iwobi and Jimenez spurned some glorious opportunities before Johnson hammered the hosts in front. However, Marco Silva’s substitutions just after the hour-mark proved fruitful, with Cairney netting the equaliser, and Fulham could have won it when Wilson’s cross was brilliantly cleared by Dragusin.

Palace move out of the relegation zone on goal difference, while Newcastle stay in 10th, as they missed the chance to move within a point of the top four. How the match unfolded\\nAfter a disjointed start owing to a spurt of Newcastle injuries, Palace got on top, and Pope made a sharp stop with his legs to keep out Ismaila Sarr, though the offside flag would have denied him anyway. That profligacy came back to haunt Palace after the break as a cleverly worked Newcastle free-kick carved them open, and Guehi inadvertently turned Gordon’s cutback into his own net. Sarr was thwarted by Pope again just after the hour-mark, with the goalkeeper smothering his chip before Dan Burn blocked Munoz’s follow-up at the near post, while Jean-Philippe Mateta volleyed high over the bar from close range.

He carved out a good opening early on, only to have the ball stolen by Fabian Schar before he could take his shot, while he also linked up well with Sarr, who proved troublesome down Palace’s right. Despite Sarr’s pressure, he could not find a way past Newcastle’s goalkeeper, and even as Justin Devenny, who scored his first Premier League goal against Aston Villa last week was introduced along with Eddie Nketiah, it looked like Palace would draw another blank – until Munoz’s late intervention, that is.

How the match unfolded\\nClear-cut chances were hard to come by during a tentative first half, though Chelsea went closest when Noni Madueke struck the post with a header from Cole Palmer’s corner.

Fulham’s substitutes prove the difference\\nFor so long, it looked like Fulham would be finishing the match empty handed, but Silva’s substitutes paid off as the hosts completely flipped the encounter on its head. At half-time, Silva will have felt unlucky – Fulham had dominated from the first whistle, only to be caught out by a quick counter-attack (and a brilliant finish) after losing the ball in midfield, and it was clear he was not keen to make any rash changes. Their desperation started to show as the clock ticked closer to the end of the 90th minute, though, with the likes of Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey sending tame long-range shots straight at Flekken. But the introduction of Traore and, in particular, Wilson, sparked a comeback that will live long in the memory.

Their desperation started to show as the clock ticked closer to the end of the 90th minute, though, with the likes of Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey sending tame long-range shots straight at Flekken. Bees’ away day blues\\nBrentford have enjoyed their home comforts of late, putting on entertaining shows in thrilling wins against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town in their last two matches at the Gtech Community Stadium. It looked like they had finally turned their fortunes around on the road despite riding their luck for most of the match, with Flekken’s early interventions keeping Brentford in the match before they scored the opener. They still struggled to make inroads against Fulham’s high press, with the usually influential Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa unable to assert themselves as the hosts wasted chance after chance. Brentford staunchly defended against the crosses being peppered into their box, but a drop in concentration at the wrong time eventually cost them, even if Wilson’s first finish was a touch of genius (or, a slice of luck).

All of the goals came in a remarkable opening period at London Stadium, where Gabriel Magalhaes, Leandro Trossard, Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz put Arsenal 4-0 up inside 36 minutes. Yet quickfire strikes from Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Emerson gave West Ham hope, though their chances of a comeback were quashed when Bukayo Saka, who also provided two assists, added Arsenal’s fifth on the stroke of half-time. Arsenal now sit six points behind leaders Liverpool, who face a heavyweight clash with Manchester City on Sunday, while West Ham remain in 14th. However, Wan-Bissaka scored his second goal in as many games after ghosting in behind Arsenal’s defence with Emerson’s stunning free-kick putting West Ham right back into it. Gabriel was punched by Fabianski, with VAR confirming Anthony Taylor’s on-field decision of penalty, and Saka’s finish had too much power for West Ham’s goalkeeper. West Ham's defence crumbles\\nThe Hammers’ win over Newcastle United on Monday eased some of the pressure on Julen Lopetegui, who had to watch this match from the stands due to suspension. With flashbacks to their 6-0 defeat in this exact fixture last season surely crossing some minds, the home fans at least got some respite when West Ham pulled two back against the run of play. Wan-Bissaka has the scoring touch at the moment, and finished coolly after latching onto a great ball from Carlos Soler, while Emerson’s free-kick, which clattered in off the woodwork, was delightful. It was only a short-lived reprieve, though, as Arsenal took advantage of West Ham’s defensive sluggishness on another set-piece before the break, with Gabriel once again given too much freedom before he was taken out by Fabianski’s glove. Edson Alvarez was brought on at half-time to try and steady the ship, and the hosts did appear more balanced, but they are yet to find consistency, something Lopetegui will need to address sooner rather than later if the Hammers are to stay clear of danger. Arsenal’s attack worked fluidly in the first half, with Trossard’s goal the perfect example of that as they sliced open West Ham’s defence with ease.

However, Salah made it 2-2 not long after the hour then kept his nerve from the penalty spot on 83 minutes, as a handball from substitute Yukinari Sugawara proved costly for Southampton. Liverpool, meanwhile, are clear at the top ahead of next week’s huge meeting with Manchester City, who were beaten 4-0 by Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Their lead, however, lasted just nine minutes as Salah brilliantly cushioned Ryan Gravenberch\\'s pass beyond the stranded McCarthy. Liverpool then laid siege to the Southampton area and when Sugawara handled Salah\\'s inswinging cross, the Egyptian made no mistake, scoring the winner from the penalty spot. Salah saves lacklustre Liverpool\\nArne Slot would be the first to admit his Liverpool side were far from their controlled best on the south coast. The Reds entered Sunday\\'s match with just six goals conceded in the Premier League this campaign. Centre-back partner Virgil van Dijk – usually a model of consistency – then conceded possession with an unnecessary flick seconds before Dibling did win a spot-kick for Southampton. Fortunately for Liverpool, they possess the type of star quality that allows them to grind out results when not at their best. While McCarthy\\'s positioning was questionable, Salah showed excellent awareness to let a dropping ball run off the outside of his boot and into an unguarded net for Liverpool’s equaliser. It was Salah\\'s own cross that led to the penalty he converted so emphatically to put Liverpool back in front, and he could have had a hat-trick when he smashed Luis Diaz\\'s deflected cross against the post late on. Salah is now on 10 league goals, two behind league top scorer Erling Haaland, in what could be his final campaign at Anfield, and his form has certainly put the Reds well on course for a title tilt. Boos rang around St Mary\\'s after Szoboszlai took advantage of a host of errors in the home defence for Liverpool’s opener. However, on a day of ups and downs, McCarthy may have to take a share of the blame for Liverpool\\'s leveller, as Salah deftly touched Gravenberch\\'s floated pass beyond him.

Beto came off the bench and proved an aerial threat for Everton, with a shot blocked in front of goal by Ethan Pinnock in stoppage time, but a largely frustrated Goodison Park crowd were forced to see their team settle for a point. Bees draw Everton’s sting\\nBrentford have collected 16 of the available 18 points at home this season, but it is their away form that has let Thomas Frank’s side down. Having lost all five of their Premier League away games, a visit to struggling Everton was a perfect opportunity for the Bees to break the duck. But after letting the hosts take the upper hand early on, Frank’s job was not made any easier by the sending-off of Norgaard, which left Brentford to play with a numerical disadvantage for almost an hour. Yet they were well organised in the second half, with Nathan Collins and Pinnock excellent, while they offered some bite on the counter, albeit Lewis-Potter could not find the finish in multiple half-chances. Frank also gave record-signing Igor Thiago his Premier League debut as a substitute. Though it was not the win that they came looking for, a spirited display that ended in a first point on the road is something that Brentford can build on. A sharp first-half display from his players would have given Dyche hope heading into the second half a man up, but the Toffees could not unlock a well-drilled Brentford side after the break, and often looked too predictable in their approach. Substitute Beto was their biggest threat as he headed straight into the gloves of Flekken five minutes after his introduction before firing another header over not much later, while he was also denied by Pinnock in added time.

      "{\"Nott'm Forest\": \"Newcastle United fought back to win at the City Ground again on Sunday, beating high-flying Nottingham Forest 3-1 with a ruthless second-half display. The Magpies had defeated Forest away from home in each of the previous two seasons, but Nuno Espirito Santo's hosts looked set for a fourth win in a row when Murillo nodded in his first career goal. Isak, who netted twice in a 2-1 win at Forest in March 2023, then turned provider for the second goal as Joelinton brilliantly beat Matz Sels, before substitute Harvey Barnes broke away to net the third. Another victory, following on from last week's win against Arsenal, lifts Newcastle to within a point of Forest, who drop to fifth following Chelsea's 1-1 draw with the Gunners. How the match unfolded\\nNewcastle might have scored first when Anthony Gordon blazed over, but Forest led against the run of play after 21 minutes as Murillo was left completely unmarked from a free-kick to nod past Nick Pope. One of those situations almost saw Nicolas Dominguez double Forest's lead early in the second half, yet instead Newcastle were level as a scramble from a corner fell for Isak to sweep in. That allowed Newcastle to give Forest a taste of their own medicine, playing on the break, and although Isak volleyed agonisingly wide, the goalscorer then teed up Joelinton, who curled an outstanding effort home via the left-hand post. Backs to the wall for Forest\\nForest had won three in a row against sides in the bottom half, but this was a sobering indication of what might be to come at the start of a tough run of fixtures. Forest perhaps would have hoped to recreate their 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield when they took the lead through Murillo, the centre-back recently called up to the Brazil squad for the first time, working hard to protect that advantage in the first half. Arsenal are up next for Forest after the international break, by which time Nuno will hope his defenders are refreshed and ready for a potentially brutal stretch. It was no surprise then that the Newcastle boss named an unchanged XI at the City Ground, and the outcome was much the same. Newcastle are short of natural right wingers, but both Gordon and Joelinton fulfilled that role against Forest, with the latter netting a vital goal.

      "{'Man City': \"Manchester City's losing streak stretched to five games as Tottenham Hotspur stunned the Premier League champions with a 4-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium. City dominated possession but struggled to find a killer pass, and their hopes of a second-half\\xa0fightback were dashed when Pedro Porro – who spent three years as a City player between 2019 and 2022 – capped another lightning break. Erling Haaland clipped the crossbar but that was as close as City came to making it competitive, with Brennan Johnson completing the rout as the worst run of Pep Guardiola's managerial career continued. Second-placed City could now find themselves eight points adrift of the summit after Liverpool’s trip to Southampton on Sunday, while Spurs climbed to sixth, four points further back. How the match unfolded\\nGuglielmo Vicario denied Haaland early on before Maddison stunned the Etihad Stadium in the 13th minute, arriving unmarked at the far post to prod Dejan Kulusevski's cross home. Haaland then rattled the crossbar after latching upon an error in the Spurs backline, but City were sliced open again in stoppage time. Rodri-less City struggle once again\\nAhead of kick-off, the Etihad Stadium paid tribute to stricken star Rodri with an elaborate ceremony to mark his Ballon d'Or win. Never has his influence over City's midfield been more obvious. With the Spaniard sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury, City have lost five successive matches across all competitions, with their title defence threatening to unravel before the festive season is in full swing. It is the longest losing run of Guardiola's managerial career, and not been the way he would have wanted to celebrate the contract extension he agreed earlier in the week. Rodri's ability to snuff out opposition attacks at source and maintain control of the midfield has been central to City's game since he arrived in Manchester five years ago. City's lack of a like-for-like Rodri replacement will be a point of concern for them ahead of a blockbuster clash with Liverpool at Anfield next. When allowed space to play on the counter-attack at the Etihad Stadium, they produced some of their most dazzling football under Postecoglou to date. Spurs have earned a reputation as a thorn in City's side in recent years, winning three of four matches against them across 2021/22 and 2022/23, then fighting back to secure a memorable 3-3 draw in this exact fixture last season. This was surely the most convincing they have ever looked against City, though.

Alex Iwobi's fantastic long-range curler put Fulham ahead in the 19th minute but Cunha – a bright spark in a so far demoralising season for Gary O'Neil's men – poked home a 31st - minute equaliser. Fulham were forced to finish the game with 10 men due to Joachim Andersen sustaining an injury after they had used all their substitutes, and Goncalo Guedes came off the bench to add a fourth for Wolves. The victory lifts them outside the relegation zone on nine points, while Fulham drop two places to ninth, four adrift of the top four. How the match unfolded\\nIt was Fulham who controlled the opening stages, but they failed to take a 16th-minute lead as Raul Jimenez stabbed Antonee Robinson's cross against the woodwork with the goal gaping. However, Wolves failed to heed that warning as Iwobi curled a wonderful strike home from 20 yards just three minutes later. Having struggled in attack early on, Wolves drew level via a moment of magic from Mario Lemina and Cunha after 31 minutes, as the former pitched a perfect chip into the Fulham box and Cunha superbly pulled it down to poke in the equaliser. Cunha then teed up Gomes for a driven, left-footed finish that put Wolves ahead in the 53rd minute, before Andersen's withdrawal left Fulham at a numerical disadvantage. Wolves have conceded more goals than any other Premier League side so far (28), yet some fine last-ditch defending from the likes of Rayan Ait-Nouri and Lemina – deployed as an emergency centre-back due to injuries to Craig Dawson and Santiago Bueno – kept Fulham at bay with the scores level. Iwobi keeps Silva smiling despite defeat\\nMarco Silva demands plenty from his Fulham stars with the Portuguese coach a stickler for standards and consistency in performances. Players who meet those levels are rewarded with a constant role in the team and Iwobi has been a shining example this term. The Nigeria international is one of six Fulham players to start all 12 Premier League games in 2024/25, with Silva now confident in his ability to produce a rounded performance on a constant basis. His early goal was one of the best he has scored as a Fulham player, picking out the top-left corner after working half a yard on the edge of the area. Iwobi also netted the winner against Leicester City in August, sealed a draw at Everton last month, and despite today's strike not yielding any points for Fulham, he will continue to be crucial to Silva's plans going forward. Fulham have a tough run coming up, however, with Tottenham, Brighton, Arsenal and Liverpool their next four Premier League opponents.

Cunha Wolves' best route to safety\\nO'Neil is under no illusions regarding the size of the task facing his Wolves side, with a 2-0 victory over Southampton – coming after back-to-back draws with Brighton and Crystal Palace – only doing so much to quieten speculation about his future. Wolves have conceded more goals than any other Premier League side so far (28), yet some fine last-ditch defending from the likes of Rayan Ait-Nouri and Lemina – deployed as an emergency centre-back due to injuries to Craig Dawson and Santiago Bueno – kept Fulham at bay with the scores level. With 20 goals scored at the other end, meanwhile, Wolves have found the net more times than any other side in the bottom nine. Cunha has contributed to half of those strikes with seven goals and three assists, and the Brazilian produced yet another Man-of-the-Match display in this comeback win in West London. If Wolves are to pull clear of the danger zone in the coming months, Cunha is the man most likely to lead their charge.

United move on to 15 points but remain 13th in the table, while Leicester stay two places behind them on 10 points. Wilfred Ndidi could have equalised before the half-hour mark, but goalkeeper Andre Onana made himself big to smother the Leicester player in a 1v1. Kristiansen was unfortunate in the 38th minute as he turned Noussair Mazraoui’s whipped cross into the roof of the net, but Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen kept the deficit down, stretching out a leg to deny Amad before half-time. He made no mistake with his second chance, brilliantly bending his shot out of Hermansen’s reach into the top corner. No late show for Leicester\\nLeicester have left it late in their recent away matches, with stoppage-time goals bringing the drama on so many occasions this season. Ayew has provided two of those, snatching a last-gasp win at Southampton before ensuring Leicester left Ipswich with a point last weekend, but he struggled to have an impact after being given a chance from the start at Old Trafford. They were not helped by the absence of Jamie Vardy, who would have relished a chance to play off the back of a United defence that had looked disconnected in previous weeks. Ayew did not offer the same threat, and Abdul Fatawu struggled to take advantage despite having the better of Diogo Dalot for much of the match. Steve Cooper would not have lost hope given their recent run though, and Leicester did improve in the second half, taking the game to a tiring United side.
