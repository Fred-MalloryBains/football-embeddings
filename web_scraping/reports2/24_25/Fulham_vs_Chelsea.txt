Pedro Neto’s late winner helped Chelsea keep their hopes of UEFA Champions League qualification alive as they came from behind to beat Fulham 2-1 at Craven Cottage.
Alex Iwobi’s fine finish in the 20th minute had the hosts in front, but two goals in 10 second-half minutes from substitute Tyrique George and Neto sealed a huge win for the Blues.
19-year-old George needed just five minutes after being introduced into the action to make an impact, rifling a first-time finish beyond the grasp of Bernd Leno from the edge of the box for his first Premier League goal.
The turnaround was complete in the third minute of second-half stoppage time when Neto collected Enzo Fernandez’s cutback, taking a touch before firing the ball into the roof of the net.
Chelsea’s victory moves them up into fifth place, ahead of Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa, while Marco Silva’s side remain ninth in the standings.
