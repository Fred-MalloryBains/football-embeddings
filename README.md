# âš½ Football Embeddings Experiments

This document outlines explains the structure and setup for this football embedding project 

---

## 1. Setup

- **Venv**: python -m venv venv to create virrtual environment
- **Install Requirements**: source venv/bin/activate;pip install -r requirements.txt
- **Jupyter**: jupyter lab  
- **Select file**: open match_reports.ipynb


---

## 2. File Structure

- **Embedding Files**: /main   
- **Data mining files**: /web_scraping
- **Datasets**: /web_scraping
- **Combined Dataset**: match_r_s.csv


---

## 3. How it works

- Using the files you are able to create team embeddings using match report and statistical data
- This data can be explored through the various visulisation methods in the match_report jupyter notebook,
- Further investigation could be done by, comparing different seasons, managers etc,
- commparing cosine similarity and euclidean distance, just the document and just the statistics
